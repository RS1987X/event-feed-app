2025-06-17,Finnair,Finnair to cancel approximately 128 flights due to industrial action at Helsinki Airport on 19 June,"[*] 
Finnair to cancel approximately 128 flights due to industrial action at Helsinki Airport on 19 June



The Finnish Aviation Union IAU has announced industrial action at Finnair’s home hub, Helsinki Airport, causing extensive disruptions to traffic on Thursday, 19 June. The four-hour industrial actions target different work shifts and thus affect many functions essential also to Finnair's flights throughout the day, such as ground handling operations and catering services.     
  
As industrial action will cause significant disruptions to the operation of flights, Finnair will have to cancel approximately 128 flights on Thursday, 19 June. Flight cancellations are expected to affect approximately 8,225 Finnair customers. Finnair will offer these customers an alternative flight.  

Customers whose flight was cancelled due to industrial action will be informed about the cancellation as soon as it has been done. After this, the customer will receive a message and be offered a new route, which will also be visible in Finnair's Manage booking service and mobile application. The offered routing can be changed within the limits of flight availability in Manage booking or through customer service. Alternatively, customers can cancel their reservation and apply for a refund for the unused ticket.    

Flight cancellations caused by industrial action have congested Finnair's customer service, so wait times are unfortunately longer than usual. Finnair has previously allowed customers scheduled to travel on strike days to reschedule their flights, helping them avoid disruptions. Thousands of customers have taken advantage of this opportunity.    
  
The industrial action might cause disruptions, for example, in the baggage handling at Helsinki Airport on Thursday, so customers travelling on Thursday are encouraged to check-in in advance, arrive at the airport on time and pack essential items, such as medicines, in carry-on baggage.

2025-06-18,Bavarian Nordic A/S,Bavarian Nordic Announces Sale of Priority Review Voucher for USD 160 Million,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark, June 18, 2025
 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Priority Review Voucher (PRV) for a total cash consideration of USD 160 million. 
 
Bavarian Nordic was awarded the PRV in February 2025, following the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the chikungunya vaccine, VIMKUNYA™ for prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in people 12 years of age and older.
 
Pursuant to a license agreement assumed upon acquisition of the chikungunya vaccine in 2023, National Institutes of Health (NIH) will receive 20% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the PRV.
 
The proceeds will be recognized as other operating income and thus will not impact the guided revenue expectations for 2025. However, EBITDA will be positively impacted and any impact on the guided EBITDA margin of 26-30% for 2025 will be updated upon closing of the transaction.
 
The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including anti-trust review, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2025. 
 
Jefferies LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Bavarian Nordic on this transaction.

info@bavarian-nordic.com",unknown,Bavarian Nordic Announces Sale of Priority Review Voucher for USD 160 Million,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark, June 18, 2025 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell its Priority Review Voucher (PRV) for a total cash consideration of USD 160 million. Bavarian Nordic was awarded the PRV in February 2025, following the approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of the chikungunya vaccine, VIMKUNYA™ for prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in people 12 years of age and older. Pursuant to a license agreement assumed upon acquisition of the chikungunya vaccine in 2023, National Institutes of Health (NIH) will receive 20% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the PRV. The proceeds will be recognized as other operating income and thus will not impact the guided revenue expectations for 2025. However, EBITDA will be positively impacted and any impact on the guided EBITDA margin of 26-30% for 2025 will be updated upon closing of the transaction. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions, including anti-trust review, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2025. Jefferies LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Bavarian Nordic on this transaction. About Bavarian Nordic Bavarian Nordic is a global vaccine company with a mission to improve health and save lives through innovative vaccines. We are a preferred supplier of mpox and smallpox vaccines to governments to enhance public health preparedness and have a leading portfolio of travel vaccines.

70 years of Finnair flights to Ivalo – Celebrating our history of extensive connections to Lapland



Finnair celebrates a significant milestone this week: 70 years since the launch of its first flight to Ivalo, the airline’s northernmost destination in Finland. The inaugural service took place on 18 June 1955, marking the beginning of a long-standing commitment to connecting travellers with the unique nature and culture of Finnish Lapland. At that time, the route was operated via Oulu, Kemi, and Rovaniemi with a DC-3 aircraft.

Located in the heart of Northern Lapland, Ivalo serves as a gateway to some of Finland’s most pristine wilderness areas, including Lake Inari, Lemmenjoki National Park, and the Hammastunturi Wilderness Area. The region offers year-round experiences, from hiking and canoeing in summer to snowmobiling and aurora hunting in winter.

In addition to Ivalo, Finnair operates direct flights to other key destinations in Lapland, including Kittilä and Rovaniemi. Kittilä provides access to the popular Levi and Ylläs ski resorts, while Rovaniemi, the capital of Lapland, is a year-round vibrant hub for tourism, culture, and business.

“Ivalo has been part of Finnair’s network for 70 years – a testament to the long-standing importance of Lapland in our operations. Today, the region is more popular than ever, and we have a strong offering year-round. We have several weekly flights to different destinations during the summer, and our schedule for the upcoming winter is the most extensive yet,” says Jenni Suomela, Vice President, Sales and Retail, Finnair.  

During this summer season Finnair flies over 50 weekly flights to Lapland. During the 2025–2026 winter season, Finnair will operate up to 72 weekly flights to Rovaniemi, 41 to Kittilä, and 33 to Ivalo. The expanded schedule is designed to support growing demand, particularly during peak travel periods and weekends, while ensuring smooth connections for international and domestic travellers alike.

Lapland continues to be one of Finnair’s most distinctive and attractive destinations. Its appeal lies in the region’s natural beauty, peacefulness, strong cultural heritage, and Nordic hospitality. From the Midnight Sun and autumn colours to the Northern Lights, Lapland offers unforgettable experiences in every season.

The FDA clearance for the Ambu® aScope™ 5 Cysto HD marks a historic milestone as the first ever single-use cysto-nephroscope to receive such clearance in the US. It follows the CE mark in Europe earlier this year, representing an important step forward in endoscopic technology and reinforcing Ambu’s commitment to innovation and advancement in urology care.
































Ambu A/S














Today, Ambu announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted expanded 510(k) clearance for the Ambu
®
 aScope™ 5 Cysto HD, authorising the endoscope’s use in percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) procedures. It is a procedure performed in the operating room, with the purpose of removing large or complex kidney stones by creating a small passageway through the patient’s back to the kidney.


The expanded clearance marks the first time a single-use flexible cysto-nephroscope has been cleared for this specific indication in the US. With the latest indication, Ambu now provides urologists with a complete single-use endoscopy solution for kidney stone management, covering the full pathway from diagnosis to treatment.


The US urology portfolio subsequently includes three single-use endoscopes – aScope™ 4 Cysto (cystoscope), aScope™ 5 Cysto HD (cysto-nephroscope) and aScope™ 5 Uretero (ureteroscope) – all in full integration with Ambu’s aView™ 2 Advance and aBox™ 2 endoscopy systems. All endoscopes and systems leverage the same digital technology platform, offering urologists a unified, advanced and high-performance solutions portfolio that enhances procedural efficiency – in line with Ambu’s strategic focus.


Ambu’s cysto-nephroscope is designed to work in combination with the company’s ureteroscope, both of which are compatible with the Ambus’ two endoscopy systems. This integration enables simultaneous connection and dual visualization of the aScope™ 5 Uretero and the aScope™ 5 Cysto HD during combined ureteroscopy and PCNL procedures, enhancing urologists’ visualization and workflow efficiency in the operating room.


""The FDA clearance of our cysto-nephroscopy solution underpins our commitment to expanding our innovation and leadership in urology. With three single-use endoscopes integrated into one digital platform, we offer a leading portfolio that enables clinicians to efficiently perform a broad range of urology procedures, advancing the standard of care for patients.""

2025-06-24,Ericsson,EMR June 2025 highlights growing monetization appeal of 5G fixed wireless access,"[*] 
EMR June 2025 highlights growing monetization appeal of 5G fixed wireless access

 * More than half of all service providers globally who offer fixed wireless access now do so with speed-based monetization benefits enhanced by 5G 
 * 5G subscriptions to top 2.9 billion globally by the end of 2025 
 * 5G networks forecast to handle 80 percent of global mobile traffic by the end of 2030 
Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) continues to grow in appeal to communications service providers (CSPs) around the world, with the ability to offer speed-based tariff plans - enhanced by 5G capabilities - proving particularly attractive, the June 2025 Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) Mobility Report shows.

While about 80 percent of the global CSPs sampled by Ericsson currently offer FWA services, the most rapid area of growth continues to be among CSPs offering 5G-enabled speed-based tariff plans.

With 5G FWA, service providers can offer a range of subscriber packages with different data speeds and entertainment options - similar to cable or fiber offerings - increasing monetization opportunities for CSPs compared to earlier generations of FWA. 

The June 2025 Ericsson Mobility Report (EMR) shows that more than half (51 percent) of global CSPs with FWA offerings, now include speed-based options - up from 40 percent on the same period in June 2024 - driven by high adoption in North America, and growth in Europe and the Middle East.

FWA is projected to account for more than 35 percent of new fixed broadband connections, with an expected increase to 350 million by the end of 2030. 5G FWA plays a crucial role in expanding broadband access, especially in areas where traditional wired infrastructure may be less feasible.

On 5G subscriptions, the June 2025 Ericsson Mobility Report forecasts subscriptions to top 2.9 billion globally by the end of 2025 - about one third of all mobile subscriptions. The 5G subscription forecast for the end of 2030 remains at 6.3 billion.

Mobile network data traffic increased by 19 percent from the first quarter of 2024 to the corresponding period in 2025. Despite a declining growth rate, net added traffic will continue to increase year-on-year, with the June 2025 EMR forecasting that mobile data traffic will more than double through the forecast period through the end of 2030.

5G networks handled 35 percent of global mobile traffic by the end of 2024, with forecasters expecting the figure to top 80 percent by the end of 2030.

In Europe, 5G mid-band coverage topped 50 percent population coverage by the end of 2024. While the figure puts the region in line with the global average, it lags far behind frontrunner countries such as North  America where 5G mid-band deployment has topped 90 percent population coverage, and India where 5G mid-band population coverage reached 95 percent by the end of 2024.

Through commentary, insights and customer/partner case stories, the June 2025 EMR highlights the ability of 5G Standalone (5G SA) and 5G Advanced to create monetization opportunities for CSPs globally, based on value delivery rather than data volume.

The report highlights how CSPs are pursuing new commercial opportunities by offering differentiated connectivity services to consumers, enterprises and public authorities. Use cases include broadcast/video production, point of sale systems, events/arenas, gaming, fixed wireless access, virtual private networks, and enterprise productivity.

Deeper dive articles include:

 * Study on how GenAI will impact future mobile network traffic. Only applications with high adoption and high data rate requirements will impact mobile network traffic growth globally. 
 * Article (co-written with BT Group) about the CSP’s launch strategy for 5G Standalone, which they branded ”More than a network upgrade.” By the end of March 2025, the 5G SA network was live and available to more than 28 million people across 50 major towns and cities in the UK, covering more than 40 percent of the population. 
 * Article (co-written with Sony) on how the company continually works with new and disruptive technologies to enhance the entertainment businesses. Dynamic slicing, in combination with Quality on Demand (QoD) APIs, will enable live media production over mobile networks, delivering great user experiences. 
Erik Ekudden, Ericsson Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, says: “We are at an inflection point, where 5G and the ecosystem are set to unleash a wave of innovation. The recent advancements in 5G standalone (SA) networks, coupled with the progress in 5G-enabled devices, have led to an ecosystem poised to unlock transformative opportunities for connected creativity.”

He adds: “Service providers have recognized this potential of 5G and are beginning to monetize it through innovative service offerings that extend beyond merely selling data plans. To fully realize the potential of 5G, it is essential to continue deploying 5G SA and to further build out mid-band sites. 5G SA capabilities serve as a catalyst for driving new business growth opportunities.”

Ericsson will host Ericsson Mobility Report online seminars at 09.00 (CEST) and at 18.00 (CEST) on Tuesday, June 24. To join please register via this link.

Historic Esbjerg–UK route celebrates 150 years of maritime connection 
 
 
 
    
 
DFDS 
marks
 the 150th anniversary of the iconic Esbjerg–UK route
, 
a vital freight corridor that has connected Denmark and the United Kingdom since
 
the
 inaugural voyage
 in
 1875.
 
 
 
 
Each year the route handles more than 100.000 single trailers - equivalent to 1.5 million lanemeters of cargo - making it an important freight link in Northern Europe. 
 
 
 
While passenger services operated from 1925 to 2014, freight has always been the backbone of the route. In the early days, ships carried live cattle; by the 20th century, they transported bacon, butter, eggs, and other staples of Danish export. 
 
 
 
“We are proud to be part of a legacy that spans a century and a half. The Esbjerg-UK route has stood the test of time, and today it is a reliable freight corridor that remains a symbol of enduring partnership between Denmark and the UK. The UK is one of the largest export markets for Denmark, and we have been supporting trade for generations and will continue to do so,” says Torben Carlsen, CEO of DFDS.    
 
 
 
As DFDS celebrates this historic milestone, the company is also looking to the future, helping customers adapt to evolving trade dynamics – from Brexit to the recent reset of trade ties between the UK and EU.  
 
 
 
“In a world where trade routes and alliances are constantly evolving, our role is to provide stability and keeping goods and our customers moving forward. The Esbjerg–UK route has weathered political shifts, regulatory changes, and economic headwinds, and remains a reliable bridge between Denmark and the UK,” says Torben Carlsen.  
 
 
 
Today, two vessels—the  Ark Dania and  Ark Germania—operate on the route between Esbjerg and Immingham, offering six weekly departures and a sailing time of approximately 18.5 hours. 
 
 
 
The route is one of 17 dedicated freight routes and 13 combined freight and passenger routes connecting continental Europe, the UK and Ireland, Türkiye and North Africa in DFDS’s ferry network.  
 
 
The history of the route
: 
significant developments
 
over the years 
 
 
 
1875-1896: the beginning
 
The route was inaugurated just one year after Esbjerg Harbour opened. The first ship, the paddle steamer Riberhuus, carried live cattle to Thameshaven.  
 
1896-1925: steamers and refrigeration
 
By 1880, the route shifted to Harwich, offering better rail access to London.  Over the next decades, DFDS modernised its fleet. In 1896, screw steamers like Primula, Ficaria and N-J Fjord replaced the older vessels, and refrigeration technology allowed for the export of processed goods—bacon, eggs, and dairy—ushering in a new era of Danish exports. 
 
1925-1945: diesel power and wartime disruption
 
The Parkeston, launched in 1925, was DFDS’s first diesel ship, cutting crossing times and increasing reliability. It was followed by three sister ships Jylland, Esbjerg, and England, serving both passengers and freight. World War II disrupted operations. Ships were seized or sunk, and the route was suspended. Only Parkeston survived.  
 
1946-1959: rebuilding
Post-war, DFDS was rebuilding. The vessel Kronprins Frederik, disassembled and hidden during the war, was finalised and became the first Danish ship with radar. It was joined by Kronprinsesse Ingrid in 1949, and by the early 1950s, DFDS had fully transitioned to motor ships. 
 
1960s: the automobile era
 had begun
 
As more people wanted to bring their vehicles across the North Sea, DFDS adapted. Initially, cars were hoisted aboard with cranes. Only 25–30 vehicles could be carried at a time. In 1964, DFDS introduced the ship England, featuring side ports and a drive-through car deck - a major leap forward in convenience and efficiency. In 1967, the Winston Churchill was launched, further improving loading operations with a floating pontoon system. It could even carry buses and trailers, including forklift-loaded bacon and butter shipments. 
 
 
1970’s and 1980’s: expansion and innovation 
In the 1970s and 1980s, DFDS expanded further. Dana Regina and later Dana Anglia served the Harwich route, while freight-only services to Grimsby and later Immingham were introduced. The MS Somerset (1966) marked the arrival of the first ro-ro vessel on the route. 
 
1990s–2014: the final passenger years
 
By the 1990s, passenger numbers were declining. 
Sirena
  
Seaways
 was the last passenger ship to sail on the route, sailing until 2014. But freight transport continued - and still does.

2025-06-25,Electrolux Group,Visionary water-saving work presented at London Climate Week,"[*] 
Visionary water-saving work presented at London Climate Week

[*]

According to the United Nations, half of the world’s population already experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, and this proportion is expected to increase in the future due to climate change and population growth. We speak with Tara Helms, Sustainability Director for Electrolux Group North America, about our latest water-efficient products and our involvement in the 50L Home Coalition’s pilot project to lower the use of water and energy in real homes in Los Angeles, California. The results are presented at this week’s London Climate Week.

The 50L Home Coalition’s pilot aims to measure the impact appliances, fixtures and consumables can have in reducing water consumption, to test whether using just 50 liters per day, per home, is achievable. 

Hi Tara, what are the results of the first pilot with the 50L Home Coalition?

We installed our 600 Series washing machines and dryers in homes in water-stressed Los Angeles in March 2023 as part of Phase 2 of the initiative. This laundry room retrofit was done in conjunction with other retrofits, including low-flow faucets. After completing Phase 2 with extensive performance data from 15 real-life homes, the Coalition demonstrated that over the nine-month test period, homes reduced their total water usage by an average of 21% versus the control homes. This is a great outcome together with our 50L Home partners including IKEA, KOHLER and Procter & Gamble.

We can even see some of the households switched permanently to cold water laundry settings. Overall hot water use in laundry was 54% lower vs. the control group’s prior consumption. This is an excellent proof point for us because most don’t draw the connection between water heating and energy use. Our goal is to demonstrate best-in-class cleaning performance, even in cold water, and the fact that hot water use can drop by over half means people are trying, and trusting, cold water washing. 

What’s next?

Phase 3 began at the end of last year and aspires to take water efficiency to the next level. Products from our 700 Series laundry pair have been installed in the highly connected homes and are being tested for nine months through sensor-based passive monitoring. Besides our Electrolux 700 Series front-load washer and dryer, this phase includes the Electrolux 24"" Stainless Steel Tub Built-In Dishwasher with SmartBoost™.

Tell us about the 700 Series.

The Electrolux 700 Series Front Load Laundry pair  – designed for cold water efficiency – was named among Green Builder Media’s 2025 Sustainable Products of the Year.

Launched at the end of 2024, the washer is powered by Smart Boost® technology which premixes water and detergent for the most effective stain removal, even in cold water. Cold water can deliver the same cleaning results, while saving on energy costs, reducing carbon emissions and helping clothes last longer.* 

Our 700 Series washing machines have cold water washing as default and feature our Care meter on the user interface. With up to three green leaves to clearly communicate to the user the most resource-efficient laundry options, the Care meter helps them save water, energy and lower their bills. The dryer also features the Wear it Again™cycle that refreshes lightly worn or stored clothing in just 15 minutes, allowing users to avoid the wash altogether.

How does the 700 Series outperform our competitors?

The 700 Series builds on our brand leadership, resulting in nearly one point market share growth since launch. We offer best-in-class cleaning performance* — even with cold washing — and we’re the only appliance company with cold water washing as a default in our washing machines. The washing machine boasts the ENERGY STAR® Most Efficient mark for 2025, and is listed with the lowest energy consumption of any standard-size washer currently available on the market.** The series is good for the planet, people and our profitability.

What can we say about how the 700 Series is designed and assembled?

The series is assembled in one of our third-party certified Zero Waste to Landfill factories, which has achieved top certifications in quality (ISO 9001) and environmental sustainability (ISO 14001). The products also incorporate recycled plastic and steel and use less chrome. Specifically, the pedestal drawers are made of up to 16% recycled material by weight. 

How does being part of the 50L Home vision create value for us now and in the future?

The coalition is a great platform for us to showcase our high-performance washers that can help consumers run more resource-efficient homes. It also gives us a clear vision to lead in laundry performance and be the best in the market. Phase 2 was about testing existing technology available on the market – which led to significantly lower water volume per cycle. Overall hot water use was 23% lower vs. prior water consumption.

Phase 3 allows us to push the boundaries by incorporating brand-new technology and see if we can truly convert homes to cold-water washing as the new norm, and minimize hand washing of dishes, with no pre-rinse, re-wash, or pre-soaking. We will use the findings from Phase 3 of this project to influence the future development of our home appliances. 

About the 50L Home Coalition

The 50L Home Coalition, convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Economic Forum (WEF), aims to make it easy and irresistible to have a water-efficient lifestyle, in which 50 liters a day feels like 500 liters, with lower energy use as well. The pilot in Los Angeles is being implemented with the U.S. Green Building Council California (USGBC-CA). Learn more about the pilot here. 

Disclaimers

* AHAM HLW-2020 tested against leading competitors with suggested retail pricing of $1549-$1999.
** According to the US Department Of Energy Compliance Certification Database and Natural Resources Canada Energy Efficiency Ratings Database, August 2024 for standard size washing machines currently on the market.

The series is assembled in one of our third-party certified Zero Waste to Landfill factories, which has achieved top certifications in quality (ISO 9001) and environmental sustainability (ISO 14001). The products also incorporate recycled plastic and steel and use less chrome. Specifically, the pedestal drawers are made of up to 16% recycled material by weight. How does being part of the 50L Home vision create value for us now and in the future? The coalition is a great platform for us to showcase our high-performance washers that can help consumers run more resource-efficient homes. It also gives us a clear vision to lead in laundry performance and be the best in the market. Phase 2 was about testing existing technology available on the market – which led to significantly lower water volume per cycle. Overall hot water use was 23% lower vs. prior water consumption. Phase 3 allows us to push the boundaries by incorporating brand-new technology and see if we can truly convert homes to cold-water washing as the new norm, and minimize hand washing of dishes, with no pre-rinse, re-wash, or pre-soaking. We will use the findings from Phase 3 of this project to influence the future development of our home appliances. About the 50L Home Coalition The 50L Home Coalition, convened by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) and the World Economic Forum (WEF), aims to make it easy and irresistible to have a water-efficient lifestyle, in which 50 liters a day feels like 500 liters, with lower energy use as well. The pilot in Los Angeles is being implemented with the U.S. Green Building Council California (USGBC-CA). Learn more about the pilot here.

2025-06-25,Finnair,"Industrial action on July 2, 4 and 7 will cause significant disruptions to Finnair flights – customers can change travel dates","[*] 
Industrial action on July 2, 4 and 7 will cause significant disruptions to Finnair flights – customers can change travel dates

The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has announced industrial action on July 2, 4, and 7, which will cause large-scale disruptions to operations at Helsinki Airport. According to IAU, the four-hour strikes will affect different work shifts. As Finnair is the largest airline operating at Helsinki Airport, the industrial action will impact all essential ground services related to Finnair flights throughout those days. 

Finnair expects the effects of the industrial action to be significant. Finnair flies over 900 flights on July 2, 4, and 7. If the strike goes ahead, a substantial number of these flights will likely be cancelled. Also, flights on days surrounding the strikes could be affected.  

Customers with bookings on these days can change their travel date free of charge to avoid disruptions caused by the strike. Flights can be rescheduled to an earlier date or postponed until the end of September. 

Customers can change their flight date via Finnair’s Manage Booking service if their ticket type allows changes. In other cases, changes can be made by contacting Finnair customer service or the travel agency that sold the tickets. There is time to make a change to the flight date until the departure date of the original flight, so there is no need to contact customer service immediately.  

“Flight cancellations caused by industrial action have unfortunately caused congestion at our customer service, and we are sorry for the harm this situation causes to our customers. We are doing everything we can to serve our customers as well as possible. We don't yet have more detailed information about the possible flight cancellations, so it is therefore not advisable to inquire about the status of your flight from customer service at this stage,” says Finnair's Head of Solution Management, Sami Suokas. 

Finnair will start cancelling flights on the strike days two days before the departure date of the flight, once it has a clearer picture of the available resources.  

Customers whose flight was cancelled due to industrial action will be informed about the cancellation as soon as it has been processed. After this, the customer will receive a message and be offered a new route, which will also be visible in Finnair's Manage Booking service and mobile application. The offered routing can be changed within the limits of flight availability in Manage booking or through customer service. Alternatively, customers can cancel their reservation and apply for a refund for the unused ticket.     

The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has also announced industrial action for 16, 18, 21, and 23 July. The impact of industrial action on these days is still being assessed, but is expected to be smaller than in early July.

2025-06-26,Bavarian Nordic A/S,Bavarian Nordic Announces the Initiation of Clinical Trials of Mpox Vaccine in Infants and Pregnant Women ,"First studies to evaluate MVA-BN in infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
The multi-partner research project is aimed at expanding access to mpox vaccines for vulnerable populations.
 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, June 26, 2025
 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced today the initiation of the first of two clinical trials designed to support approval and use of the MVA-BN
®
 mpox/smallpox vaccine in vulnerable populations: infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women
 
The first participants have been vaccinated in a study (
NCT06844487
), evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of MVA-BN in 344 infants aged 4-24 months. Recruitment has also started in a second study (
NCT06844500
), which is planned to enrol 359 women (pregnant or breastfeeding), also to be evaluated for safety and immunogenicity of MVA-BN. Both studies are conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the epicentre of the ongoing mpox outbreak, where infants and pregnant women remain highly vulnerable to mpox.
 
Paul Chaplin, President & CEO of Bavarian Nordic
, said: 
“
Through partnerships we have made significant advances already by expanding access to our mpox vaccine for children and adolescents. These new studies will fill the gap by providing important data about the use of MVA-BN in infants and pregnant women, and we applaud the study partners as well as the funding partners, EDCTP3 and CEPI for supporting this important work which could help support a label expansion for MVA-BN to include the most vulnerable populations.
”
 
Both studies are part of the 
PregInPoxVac
 research project, led by the University of Antwerp and the University of Kinshasa. The project is further supported by partners in Kenya (ACE Research) and Italy (Penta Foundation), funded by the European Union Global Health EDCTP3, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and Bavarian Nordic.
 
In addition, Bavarian Nordic is sponsoring a trial of MVA-BN in children aged 2-11 years, which has received funding support from CEPI. Topline results from this trial (
NCT06549530
) are anticipated in the third quarter of 2025. Once full results become available, these could potentially support regulatory approval of MVA-BN for younger children.
 
About the mpox vaccine
MVA-BN or Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic is the only non-replicating mpox vaccine approved in the U.S., Switzerland, Singapore and Mexico (marketed as JYNNEOS
®
), Canada (marketed as IMVAMUNE
®
), and the EU/EAA and United Kingdom (marketed as IMVANEX
®
). Originally developed as a smallpox vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. government to ensure the supply of a smallpox vaccine for the entire population, including immunocompromised individuals who are not recommended vaccination with traditional replicating smallpox vaccines, MVA-BN has been indicated for use in the general population in individuals considered at risk for smallpox or mpox infection.
 
About Bavarian Nordic
Bavarian Nordic is a global vaccine company with a mission to improve health and save lives through innovative vaccines. We are a preferred supplier of mpox and smallpox vaccines to governments to enhance public health preparedness and have a leading portfolio of travel vaccines. For more information, visit

2025-06-26,AFRY,AFRY will conduct a feasibility study for an E-Methane plant in Kotka,"[*] 
AFRY will conduct a feasibility study for an E-Methane plant in Kotka

AFRY has been tasked by Arctic Sisu, a Finnish e-fuel company, to conduct a feasibility study for a large-scale e-methane production facility in Kotka, Finland. The project, planned in three phases, aims to produce 900–950 GWh of renewable e-methane annually, using CO2 from nearby pulp production as a raw material.

The study will support Arctic Sisu in making their investment decision which is expected in 2026. The plant would be built next to the existing Kotkamills Pulp & Paper mill and would capture and reuse CO2 emissions from the pulp production process as a raw material for e-methane production, making it Europe’s first facility to capture and reuse CO2 from pulp production. The produced e-methane offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels in the maritime sector. 

Scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, the study will provide Arctic Sisu with the detailed analysis required to move forward with the investment decision, including determining the conditions under which e-methane production at the site would be feasible and optimal. If implemented, the commercial production for the first stage is planned to begin in 2028.

The study follows a top-down design approach, starting from the overall project and plant goals and progressing to detailed engineering and discipline-specific decisions necessary to achieve those goals. The study incorporates the latest information from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and AFRY's in-house data, ensuring that all evaluations are based on the most current and relevant technical and market insights.

“We see clear value — and have already gained it — from AFRY’s experience in similar plant developments and other industrial projects they’ve contributed to. The collaboration has started off well, and we’re eager to see how it progresses and what this phase delivers, along with the upcoming stages of both the project and sourcing,” says Jonne Pöyhtäri, CEO of Arctic Sisu.

“We are excited to partner with Arctic Sisu in this pioneering project to utilize CO2 from pulp production as e-methane raw material and to support them in their journey to become a significant e-fuel producer. We look forward to offering our insights into the entire power-to-x value chain for this project which ultimately enables the transition to more sustainable maritime and other transportation,” said Jukka Lehtonen, Head of Business Unit, Renewable and Thermal Energy at AFRY in Finland.

The Kotka plant is Arctic Sisu’s first announced e-methane project. The company aims to become one of the most significant e-fuel producers in Europe by 2030.

",unknown,AFRY will conduct a feasibility study for an E-Methane plant in Kotka,"[*] AFRY will conduct a feasibility study for an E-Methane plant in Kotka AFRY has been tasked by Arctic Sisu, a Finnish e-fuel company, to conduct a feasibility study for a large-scale e-methane production facility in Kotka, Finland. The project, planned in three phases, aims to produce 900–950 GWh of renewable e-methane annually, using CO2 from nearby pulp production as a raw material. The study will support Arctic Sisu in making their investment decision which is expected in 2026. The plant would be built next to the existing Kotkamills Pulp & Paper mill and would capture and reuse CO2 emissions from the pulp production process as a raw material for e-methane production, making it Europe’s first facility to capture and reuse CO2 from pulp production. The produced e-methane offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels in the maritime sector. Scheduled for completion by the end of 2025, the study will provide Arctic Sisu with the detailed analysis required to move forward with the investment decision, including determining the conditions under which e-methane production at the site would be feasible and optimal. If implemented, the commercial production for the first stage is planned to begin in 2028. The study follows a top-down design approach, starting from the overall project and plant goals and progressing to detailed engineering and discipline-specific decisions necessary to achieve those goals. The study incorporates the latest information from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and AFRY's in-house data, ensuring that all evaluations are based on the most current and relevant technical and market insights. “We see clear value — and have already gained it — from AFRY’s experience in similar plant developments and other industrial projects they’ve contributed to. The collaboration has started off well, and we’re eager to see how it progresses and what this phase delivers, along with the upcoming stages of both the project and sourcing,” says Jonne Pöyhtäri, CEO of Arctic Sisu. “We are excited to partner with Arctic Sisu in this pioneering project to utilize CO2 from pulp production as e-methane raw material and to support them in their journey to become a significant e-fuel producer. We look forward to offering our insights into the entire power-to-x value chain for this project which ultimately enables the transition to more sustainable maritime and other transportation,” said Jukka Lehtonen, Head of Business Unit, Renewable and Thermal Energy at AFRY in Finland. The Kotka plant is Arctic Sisu’s first announced e-methane project. The company aims to become one of the most significant e-fuel producers in Europe by 2030.

2025-06-26,BioArctic,Professor Lars Lannfelt to receive the 2025 Hartwig Piepenbrock-DZNE Prize,"[*] 
Professor Lars Lannfelt to receive the 2025 Hartwig Piepenbrock-DZNE Prize

Stockholm, Sweden, June 26, 2025– BioArctic AB (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) announced today that BioArctic's founder, Professor Lars Lannfelt, will receive the 2025 Hartwig Piepenbrock-DZNE Prize for his pioneering contributions to the understanding of Alzheimer’s disease and to the development of the drug lecanemab. The prize is presented jointly by German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) and the Piepenbrock Group. The award ceremony will take place in Bonn in November this year.

""I’m proud to have been awarded the 2025 Hartwig Piepenbrock-DZNE Prize. Being able to give hope and contribute to the treatment of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease is what has driven me throughout my research life,"" said Professor Lars Lannfelt. ""It is inspiring to see how research in this field now has begun to take quantum leaps with the development of treatments such as lecanemab which demonstrated benefits to patients in the global Phase 3 Clarity AD trial using gold standard endpoints. Coupled with the introduction of modern diagnostic methods, I am convinced that we are facing a paradigm shift where, in time, we will be able to offer not just a slowdown in the progression of the disease but eventually be able to  halt the disease process.""

Professor Lars Lannfelt founded BioArctic together with Pär Gellerfors in 2003 to develop an antibody treatment based on Lannfelt's groundbreaking discoveries of the role of amyloid-beta protein in Alzheimer's disease. These discoveries are the basis for lecanemab, an antibody treatment developed in collaboration with the Japanese company Eisai. By binding to specific forms of amyloid-beta, which causes Alzheimer's disease, lecanemab helps to clear them from the brain, thereby altering the course of the disease.

Since 2011, the Hartwig Piepenbrock-DZNE Prize has been awarded every two years for outstanding research on neurodegenerative disorders. The prize is sponsored by the Piepenbrock Group and is awarded in remembrance of its former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Hartwig Piepenbrock, who passed away after suffering from dementia. Prize winners are selected by an international committee, coordinated by DZNE. On this occasion, the prize will be awarded for the eighth time.

 Customer Advisory
Middle East Situation Update

 
26 June 2025



Dear Customer,


Tensions in the Middle East have significantly escalated, impacting operations involving Iran and Israel. Given the ongoing volatility and to ensure the safety of our crew, vessels and customers&rsquo; cargo, Maersk temporarily suspended vessel calls to the Port of Haifa.


As of 25 June 2025, cargo acceptance to Haifa port for imports has been reopened. We are monitoring the situation very closely and based on the recent developments and with prospects of a cease-fire currently in place, we expect to be able to reopen export cargo acceptance once the lower safety risk of doing so has been reconfirmed.


Operations continue at the Port of Ashdod, though we are closely monitoring the situation and will promptly reassess our decisions based on objective security assessments and maritime advisories.


As of 25 June 2025, the Strait of Hormuz remains navigable, and Maersk is closely following maritime security advisories. Our teams are working out contingency plans on a case-by-case basis to swiftly adapt to potential changes and will update customers of changes to the situation.

Your cargo

We understand the importance of clear and reliable information during this uncertain period. Cargo acceptance to Haifa port for imports has now been reopened and we continue to monitor the situation for export acceptance and resuming sailings to Haifa. Current diversion plans and contingencies for cargo from Haifa are actively being finalised on a case-by-case basis. Customers will receive updates when they are entered in the system through the ETA notification system, which we encourage you to join by

 Customer Advisory
Middle East Situation Update

 
27 June 2025



Dear Customer,


Due to escalations in tensions in the Middle East that have impacted operations involving Iran and Israel, Maersk has previously announced a temporary suspension of vessel calls to the Port of Haifa.


With the prospect of current cease-fire agreement bringing de-escalation to the conflict, we have decided to resume vessel calls to the Port of Haifa, and acceptance for both import and export cargo is now open. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will be ready to make changes if safety concerns reappear.


As of 25 June 2025, we have reopened import cargo acceptance to Haifa port. Vessels scheduled to call Haifa will continue with their regular port calls starting Monday, 30 June.


The situation and operations at the Port of Ashdod remain unchanged, though we continue to monitor the latest developments and maritime advisories. For the latest updates on your cargo, please 
https://click.e.maersk.com/?qs=4d494cc5983cadcc86d74f0627c0f35c3ce4f2c0f8718b9b943afc67297eab6f6c134c802e7783aecf39dfb08ba0f9a43f697b29549e7948bf363174b54e6b31 
sign up for ETA notifications  and you will be updated as any changes are made in the system.


The safety of our crews and operations remain our top priorities and we appreciate your understanding as we navigate the current situation. Rest assured that our teams are doing their utmost to minimise the impact on your supply chains. Should you have any questions, or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to your local Maersk teams, who are standing by and ready to assist.

Customer Advisory Middle East Situation Update 27 June 2025 Dear Customer, Due to escalations in tensions in the Middle East that have impacted operations involving Iran and Israel, Maersk has previously announced a temporary suspension of vessel calls to the Port of Haifa. With the prospect of current cease-fire agreement bringing de-escalation to the conflict, we have decided to resume vessel calls to the Port of Haifa, and acceptance for both import and export cargo is now open. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will be ready to make changes if safety concerns reappear. As of 25 June 2025, we have reopened import cargo acceptance to Haifa port. Vessels scheduled to call Haifa will continue with their regular port calls starting Monday, 30 June. The situation and operations at the Port of Ashdod remain unchanged, though we continue to monitor the latest developments and maritime advisories. For the latest updates on your cargo, please sign up for ETA notifications and you will be updated as any changes are made in the system. The safety of our crews and operations remain our top priorities and we appreciate your understanding as we navigate the current situation. Rest assured that our teams are doing their utmost to minimise the impact on your supply chains.

Corem divests a property in New York

[*]

Corem has signed an agreement with Capstone Equities to divest the project property 28&7 in Manhattan New York at a underlying property value corresponding to approximately SEK 770 million based on today’s exchange rate.

The total leasable area amounts to approximately 9,300 sq.m, consisting mainly of premises for offices complemented by restaurants on the ground floor. Transfer of the property is planned to take place at the end of August 2025.

The divestment causes a net profit effect of approximately -215 million SEK, which is mainly due to the challenging combination of averse market conditions during the project period, including increased production and project financing costs, as well as an extended completion time.

For the entire interim period (January-June 2025), Corem's total divestments amount to around 3.5 billion SEK in underlying property value, with a net profit effect of approximately -135 million SEK.

“The sale of 28&7 is well-timed for us as the project is nearly fully completed and leased. As we are now refining Corem, a reduction in the US portfolio is a long-term strategic choice. The aim is to focus on our main market consisting of strong cities within the Swedish real estate market. All divestments during the period enable a continued optimization of our financial structure, something we see provides positive long-term effects"", said Rutger Arnhult, CEO of Corem.

Finnair cancels approximately 100 flights on July 2 due to industrial action - Customers are being contacted directly 



The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has announced industrial action on Wednesday, July 2, at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. If the planned actions are implemented, they will impact all essential ground services related to Finnair flights. 

Due to the planned industrial action, Finnair will have to cancel approximately 100 flights on Wednesday, July 2. These cancellations will affect the travel plans of roughly 7,000 customers.

Customers with bookings on July 2 will receive information from Finnair in case their flight is cancelled. Finnair will contact affected passengers once the cancellations are processed in the system starting today, June 30. After that, customers will receive a new routing based on the contact details in their booking. The information will also appear in the Manage Booking service and Finnair’s mobile app. Depending on availability, the proposed new route can be changed via Manage Booking or Customer Service. Alternatively, customers may cancel their trip and request a refund for the ticket.

Finnair has allowed customers scheduled to travel on July 2 to change their flight date without additional charges, and thousands have taken advantage of this option.

The IAU has also announced industrial action on July 4, 7, 16, 18, 21, and 23. The potential impacts of these actions are still being assessed, so Finnair’s Customer Service is unable to provide information about possible flight cancellations on those dates now. Finnair will notify affected customers directly of cancellations two days in advance.

Customers with bookings on 4 and 7 July are encouraged to change their travel date already now. Flights can be rescheduled to an earlier date or postponed until the end of September. The change can be made via Finnair’s Manage Booking service if their ticket type allows changes. In other cases, changes can be made by contacting Finnair customer service or the travel agency that sold the tickets.  The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has also announced industrial action for 16, 18, 21, and 23 July. The impact of industrial action on these days is still being assessed, but is expected to be smaller than in early July.  

Finnair apologises for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by the situation and recommends checking the Finnair website for the latest travel updates at www.finnair.com/travelupdates .

AFRY is technical partner for Redelfi’s new battery energy storage pipeline in Italy

Redelfi has appointed AFRY to provide technical advisory services to support the development of a new portfolio of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) across Italy. The project aims to accelerate the country’s energy transition by enabling more reliable integration of renewable energy into the grid. 

Redelfi is a private Italian company specialising in the development of sustainable and innovative infrastructure for the energy transition. As part of its “Redelfi 2 Pipeline”, the company is developing 9 stand-alone BESS projects, which together are expected to reach an installed capacity of approximately 1 GW. 

The battery systems will be able to store clean energy for 4-8 hours, making it available on demand. This will contribute to grid stability and reduce reliance on conventional power generation.

AFRY will provide basic design and support throughout the authorisation process to ensure compliance with national regulations and international standards, ultimately bringing the projects to a ready-to-build stage within a streamlined timeline. AFRY's role also includes preparing vendor due diligence reports. 

Davide Sommariva, President of Redelfi Group, commented on the partnership with AFRY: “This new agreement with AFRY represents a significant step in the implementation of the Redelfi 2 pipeline and strengthens a collaboration based on shared values, strategic vision, and a mutual commitment to a sustainable energy future. We aim for solid and responsible growth, supported by high-profile partners like AFRY”.

“We are proud of our longstanding partnership with Redelfi, built on trust and collaboration. Our continued engagement reflects AFRY’s client-centric approach and commitment to advancing sustainable solutions together"", says Alessio Giuffra, AFRY’s Managing Director for Italy.

2025-07-01,Bravida Holding AB,Bravida's climate targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative,"[*] 
Bravida's climate targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative

The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) has approved Bravida's emission reduction targets. The climate targets are absolute emissions targets for Scope 1 and 2, and engagement targets for Bravida's Scope 3 emissions.

Bravida's near term targets, now approved by the SBTi are to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 42 percent by 2029, compared to the base year 2023*.  

SBTi is a global organisation that makes it possible for companies to set ambitious emission reduction targets in line with the latest climate science and the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The initiative is a collaboration between CDP, the World Resources Institute (WRI), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the UN Global Compact.

Bravida's long-term targets are still to reduce emissions throughout the company's value chain and to achieve climate neutrality by 2045. 

As a large part of Bravida's emissions occur at suppliers and customers, Bravida has chosen to set an engagement target for these participants in the value chain, to encourage them to adopt science-based climate targets. 

“We are proud that our climate targets have now been validated scientifically. This is a big step in terms of our sustainability efforts and clear confirmation of the responsibility taken by Bravida regarding this issue. Measuring our emissions is crucial for enabling us to continue pursuing the climate transition and meeting our customers’ requirements, and we see that the availability of climate data is also increasing in the market. We will now continue with our work to realise our climate ambitions for our own business operations and in collaboration with our customers and suppliers,” comments Petra Vranjes, Group CFO at Bravida.

Bravida’s targets:

• Bravida Holding AB commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 42% by 2029 from a 2023 base year.*

• Bravida Holding AB commits that 76% of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services, will have science-based targets by 2029.

• Bravida Holding AB commits that 70% of its customers by revenue covering use of sold products, will have science-based targets by 2029.

* The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.

More information about Science Based Targets is available here.

Camurus’ Oczyesa® receives marketing authorization for treatment of acromegaly in the EU







 * First subcutaneous, once-monthly octreotide for treatment of acromegaly 
 * For convenient self-administration with a pre-filled autoinjector pen 
Lund, Sweden — 1 July  2025 — Camurus (NASDAQ STO: CAMX) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has granted Oczyesa®, octreotide subcutaneous depot, marketing authorization* for the maintenance treatment in adult patients with acromegaly who have responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogs.1 

“Oczyesa is the first approved once-monthly, subcutaneous octreotide treatment for patients with acromegaly”, says Fredrik Tiberg, President & CEO, CSO at Camurus. “We look forward to making this new treatment option, designed for convenient self-administration, available to eligible patients in the EU as soon as possible.”

Acromegaly is a rare, serious, and chronic disease characterized by excessive growth of bone and tissue, resulting in enlarged hands, feet, facial features, and inner organs. Symptoms include fatigue, joint pain, headache, visual field defects, excessive sweating, and paresthesia.2 Patients with uncontrolled acromegaly often experience reduced quality of life and increased mortality risk.3,4 An estimated 70,000 people in the EU are living with acromegaly.5 

“Oczyesa is a welcome new treatment option for patients with acromegaly, providing effective disease control and enabling convenient self-administration by patients”, says Dr Diego Ferone, Professor in Endocrinology, Head of Department of Internal Medicine at the Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, University of Genova, Italy, and coordinating investigator of the ACROINNOVA program. “Results from the ACROINNOVA clinical program have shown that Oczyesa provides effective and durable biochemical treatment response, as well as improved acromegaly symptom control and quality of life compared to current standard treatment.”

The marketing authorization of Oczyesa is based on the results from a comprehensive clinical program comprising seven clinical studies, including two Phase 3 studies. The ACROINNOVA 1 study demonstrated that treatment with Oczyesa results in a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving normalized insulin growth-factor-1 (IGF-1) levels compared to placebo. The persistence of mean IGF-1 values and reduction of symptoms were confirmed over 52 weeks in the ACROINNOVA 2 study. Furthermore, the study showed improvements in symptoms, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction scores after 52 weeks of treatment with Oczyesa compared to standard of care (SoC) at baseline.6,7 The most common side effects included gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, hepatobiliary disorders, metabolism and nutritional disorders, and injection site reactions.1

Oczyesa is formulated using Camurus’ proprietary FluidCrystal® technology. The product is designed for easy and convenient once-monthly, subcutaneous self-administration using a pre-filled autoinjector pen with a hidden, thin needle.

About acromegaly
Acromegaly is a rare, progressive disease, typically caused by a tumor of the pituitary gland producing excess growth hormone and stimulating increased insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels. This results in abnormal growth of bone and tissue, enlarged hands, feet, facial features and inner organs, and symptoms such as fatigue, joint pain, headache, visual field defects, excessive sweating, and paresthesia.2 Inadequate biochemical and symptom control can have detrimental impacts on quality of life and mortality of patients with acromegaly.3,4 The prevalence of acromegaly is estimated to about 60 cases per million.8

About Oczyesa® (CAM2029)
Oczyesa® (CAM2029) is a ready-to-use, long-acting subcutaneous depot of octreotide indicated for maintenance treatment in adult patients with acromegaly who have responded to and tolerated treatment with somatostatin analogs.1 The product is stored at room temperature and should not be refrigerated.

The CAM2029 clinical program for acromegaly comprises of seven clinical trials, including four Phase 1 studies, one Phase 2 study, and two Phase 3 studies within the ACROINNOVA clinical program. CAM2029 has demonstrated an approximate five-fold higher bioavailability compared to the currently approved, long-acting, intramuscular (IM) octreotide.9 In the Phase 3 ACROINNOVA program, CAM2029 showed superior biochemical control compared to placebo as well as improvements in symptom control, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life compared to standard-of-care (SoC) at baseline with first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs), octreotide and lanreotide. The safety profile of CAM2029 was consistent with SoC with no new findings.6,7

CAM2029 is under development for two additional chronic and severe disease indications: gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET) and polycystic liver disease (PLD).

	Robot families to meet growing demand in high-growth segments across China, in line with ABB&rsquo;s &lsquo;local for local&rsquo; strategy



	Covering essential tasks from material handling to high-end applications including dispensing and polishing



	All powered by OmniCore&trade; controller platform for seamless integration



	Manufactured at ABB Robotics&rsquo; state-of-the-art Shanghai Mega Factory, reinforcing local investment and ABB&rsquo;s full value chain in China


ABB is expanding its portfolio with three new robot families to support China&rsquo;s ongoing expansion in advanced manufacturing, building on 30 years of robotics leadership in the country.

Manufactured at ABB&rsquo;s Robotics&rsquo; state-of-the-art Shanghai Mega Factory, the new robot families address a wide range of automation needs in high growth sectors including electronics, consumer industries and general industries -- from essential material handling to high-end applications like dispensing and polishing.&nbsp; All are powered by ABB Robotics&rsquo; OmniCore&trade; single control platform that enables the full integration of AI, sensor, cloud and edge computing systems to create the most advanced and autonomous robotic applications. This strategic expansion comes as China&rsquo;s mid-market robotics segment has grown at a 24% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, with the market expected to continue growing at 8% annually through 2028.*

&ldquo;China is the world&rsquo;s largest robotics market and for ABB Robotics. China&rsquo;s growth in sectors such as electronics and from small and medium sized businesses is driving the increasing demand for accessible, user-friendly solutions, and we are responding to that demand&rdquo; said Sami Atiya, President of ABB&rsquo;s Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation Business Area. &ldquo;With our new robot families, we are not only expanding what is already the most comprehensive and integrated offering in the market, but we are helping new industries and customers automate with new mid-market value propositions.&rdquo;

ABB&rsquo;s new robot families 

Lite+

Designed for essential material handling and pick-and-place operations, Lite+ is compact, easy to use, and lowers the barriers to automation for smaller operators.&nbsp; Available in China and Asia, its seamless integration with the new IRB 1200 and other IRB robots provides flexible, end-to-end production solutions for industries including electronics manufacturing.

PoWa

PoWa is a compact cobot built for speed, collaboration, and efficiency. With industrial-level speeds of up to 5.8 m/s, it is ideal for fast pick-and-place, palletizing, and machine-tending tasks. Available in China, PoWa&rsquo;s no-code programming and plug-and-play capabilities mean it can be operational within 60 minutes of unboxing, making it particularly attractive to SMEs.

IRB 1200 (New Generation)

The redesigned IRB 1200, available globally, is optimized for high-speed, high-precision applications including assembly, polishing, and dispensing. Approximately 20% lighter and more compact than its predecessor, the IRB 1200 enables manufacturers to create space-efficient production cells, boosting throughput and operational efficiency.

New AI-powered innovations extend China technology leadership 

All three robot families are powered by ABB&rsquo;s OmniCore&trade; controller platform, ensuring seamless integration and providing access to ABB&rsquo;s industry-leading software suite, including RobotStudio&reg;.

&ldquo;Building on 30 years of robotics leadership in China, we are meeting the needs of customers in new and expanding industries with these three robot families,&rdquo; said Marc Segura President of ABB Robotics. &ldquo;By delivering flexible, modular, AI-powered technology that lowers barriers to automation, we are driving adoption of advanced manufacturing in new segments and supporting the next wave of industrial innovation in China and beyond.&rdquo;

ABB&rsquo;s launch event in Shanghai featured a pioneering, AI-driven natural language software tool for teaching robots, using its new PoWa collaborative robot. Combining generative and analytical AI, the technology speeds up the teaching process for robots using three simple steps: &lsquo;see, speak, do,&rsquo; with the robot visually perceiving its environment, processing verbal instructions in real time, and immediately translating them into precise actions.

&ldquo;ABB has led the way in robotics for more than five decades, with deep roots in China dating back to 1994,&rdquo; said Henry Han, President of Robotics in China. &ldquo;Today, we continue to expand our robotics leadership in China, for China and beyond, building on our full local value chain of manufacturing, research and development to deliver groundbreaking solutions for our customers in businesses of all sizes.&rdquo;

China is the world&rsquo;s largest robotics market and accounted for more than half of global robot installations in 2023**. With over 90 percent of ABB robots for Chinese customers now manufactured locally, the launch is part of ABB&rsquo;s commitment to China&#39;s advanced manufacturing transformation.

  ",unknown,ABB strengthens China robotics leadership with three new robot families,"ZURICH, SWITZERLAND, JULY 2, 2025 ABB strengthens China robotics leadership with three new robot families Robot families to meet growing demand in high-growth segments across China, in line with ABB’s ‘local for local’ strategy Covering essential tasks from material handling to high-end applications including dispensing and polishing All powered by OmniCore™ controller platform for seamless integration Manufactured at ABB Robotics’ state-of-the-art Shanghai Mega Factory, reinforcing local investment and ABB’s full value chain in China ABB is expanding its portfolio with three new robot families to support China’s ongoing expansion in advanced manufacturing, building on 30 years of robotics leadership in the country. Manufactured at ABB’s Robotics’ state-of-the-art Shanghai Mega Factory, the new robot families address a wide range of automation needs in high growth sectors including electronics, consumer industries and general industries -- from essential material handling to high-end applications like dispensing and polishing. All are powered by ABB Robotics’ OmniCore™ single control platform that enables the full integration of AI, sensor, cloud and edge computing systems to create the most advanced and autonomous robotic applications. This strategic expansion comes as China’s mid-market robotics segment has grown at a 24% CAGR between 2021 and 2024, with the market expected to continue growing at 8% annually through 2028.* “China is the world’s largest robotics market and for ABB Robotics. China’s growth in sectors such as electronics and from small and medium sized businesses is driving the increasing demand for accessible, user-friendly solutions, and we are responding to that demand” said Sami Atiya, President of ABB’s Robotics & Discrete Automation Business Area. “With our new robot families, we are not only expanding what is already the most comprehensive and integrated offering in the market, but we are helping new industries and customers automate with new mid-market value propositions.” ABB’s new robot families Lite+ Designed for essential material handling and pick-and-place operations, Lite+ is compact, easy to use, and lowers the barriers to automation for smaller operators. Available in China and Asia, its seamless integration with the new IRB 1200 and other IRB robots provides flexible, end-to-end production solutions for industries including electronics manufacturing. PoWa PoWa is a compact cobot built for speed, collaboration, and efficiency. With industrial-level speeds of up to 5.8 m/s, it is ideal for fast pick-and-place, palletizing, and machine-tending tasks. Available in China, PoWa’s no-code programming and plug-and-play capabilities mean it can be operational within 60 minutes of unboxing, making it particularly attractive to SMEs. IRB 1200 (New Generation) The redesigned IRB 1200, available globally, is optimized for high-speed, high-precision applications including assembly, polishing, and dispensing. Approximately 20% lighter and more compact than its predecessor, the IRB 1200 enables manufacturers to create space-efficient production cells, boosting throughput and operational efficiency. New AI-powered innovations extend China technology leadership All three robot families are powered by ABB’s OmniCore™ controller platform, ensuring seamless integration and providing access to ABB’s industry-leading software suite, including RobotStudio®. “Building on 30 years of robotics leadership in China, we are meeting the needs of customers in new and expanding industries with these three robot families,” said Marc Segura President of ABB Robotics. “By delivering flexible, modular, AI-powered technology that lowers barriers to automation, we are driving adoption of advanced manufacturing in new segments and supporting the next wave of industrial innovation in China and beyond.” ABB’s launch event in Shanghai featured a pioneering, AI-driven natural language software tool for teaching robots, using its new PoWa collaborative robot. Combining generative and analytical AI, the technology speeds up the teaching process for robots using three simple steps: ‘see, speak, do,’ with the robot visually perceiving its environment, processing verbal instructions in real time, and immediately translating them into precise actions. “ABB has led the way in robotics for more than five decades, with deep roots in China dating back to 1994,” said Henry Han, President of Robotics in China. “Today, we continue to expand our robotics leadership in China, for China and beyond, building on our full local value chain of manufacturing, research and development to deliver groundbreaking solutions for our customers in businesses of all sizes.” China is the world’s largest robotics market and accounted for more than half of global robot installations in 2023**. With over 90 percent of ABB robots for Chinese customers now manufactured locally, the launch is part of ABB’s commitment to China's advanced manufacturing transformation. *ABB Estimates, in USD **IFR, 2024 ABB is a global technology leader in electrification and automation, enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future.

Finnair cancels approximately 80 flights on July 4 due to industrial action – Customers are being contacted directly



The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has announced industrial action on Friday, July 4, at Helsinki Airport. If the planned actions are implemented, they will impact all essential ground services related to Finnair flights.

Due to the planned industrial action, Finnair will have to cancel approximately 80 flights on Friday, July 4. These cancellations will affect the travel plans of roughly 8000 customers.

Customers with bookings on July 4 will receive information from Finnair in case their flight is cancelled. Finnair will contact affected passengers once the cancellations are processed in the system starting today, July 2. After that, customers will receive a new routing based on the contact details in their booking. The information will also appear in the Manage Booking service and Finnair’s mobile app. Depending on availability, the proposed new route can be changed via Manage Booking or Customer Service. Alternatively, customers may cancel their trip and request a refund for the ticket.

Finnair has allowed customers scheduled to travel on July 4 to change their flight date without additional charges, and thousands have taken advantage of this option.

The IAU has also announced industrial action on July 7, 16, 18, 21, and 23. The potential impacts of these actions are still being assessed, so Finnair’s Customer Service is unable to provide information about possible flight cancellations on those dates now. Finnair will notify affected customers directly of cancellations two days in advance.

Customers with bookings on 7 July are encouraged to change their travel date already now. Flights can be rescheduled to an earlier date or postponed until the end of September. The change can be made via Finnair’s Manage Booking service if their ticket type allows changes. In other cases, changes can be made by contacting Finnair customer service or the travel agency that sold the tickets. The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has also announced industrial action for 16, 18, 21, and 23 July. The impact of industrial action on these days is still being assessed, but is expected to be smaller than in early July. 

Finnair apologises for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by the situation and recommends checking the Finnair website for the latest travel updates at www.finnair.com/travelupdates.

I want to thank Robert for his commitment during these years and for great collaboration” says Linda Pålsson, CEO 

“I have decided to take on an exciting new job opportunity outside of AFRY, but it is with mixed emotions.

AFRY appointed lenders’ technical advisor for the world’s largest hybrid solar project in the Philippines

AFRY has been engaged as the lenders’ technical advisor (LTA) for a landmark solar and battery energy storage project in the Philippines. With a total capacity of 3,500 MWp of solar power combined with 4,500 MWh of battery storage, it will be the largest installation of its kind globally.

Terra Solar Philippines Inc., backed by MGreen, the renewable energy subsidiary of the Philippines’ largest energy distribution utility, Meralco, together with a consortium of six banks, has appointed AFRY to provide technical advisory services for the development and construction of its flagship project, which spans six municipalities across Nueva Ecija and Bulacan provinces.

AFRY conducted the initial technical due diligence that enabled the bankability of the project, which recently secured one of the largest financing deals in the Philippine energy sector. As the project moves into the next phase, AFRY’s role continues with construction monitoring through to final completion, followed by operational phase support through operations & maintenance and annual budget review.

This transformative project will be developed in two phases, with completion targeted for 2026 and 2027. Once operational, it will be connected to the grid through a 13-kilometre 500kV transmission line.

The Terra Solar project is expected to supply clean, reliable energy to around 2.4 million households and reduce carbon emissions by approximately 4.3 million tons annually. The facility will also contribute to grid stability, energy security, and long-term resilience for the Philippines.

“The Terra Solar initiative represents a significant step forward in supporting the Philippines’ energy roadmap — enhancing energy security, building long-term resilience, and enabling a low carbon future. We are excited to contribute our expertise as LTA to a greener future and be part of a project that will deliver lasting environmental and economic benefits,"" said Petteri Harkki, AFRY’s Regional Director for Asia.

Catena acquires logistics facility in Jönköping with Elgiganten as the tenant

Catena has signed an agreement with a fund managed by Niam to acquire a property in Jönköping for approximately SEK 1,275 million. As a result of the acquisition, Catena will own and manage a total of more than 200,000 m² of logistics space with Elgiganten as the tenant in Torsvik industrial area.

3 July 2025 5.30 p.m. CEST



The Barnarps Kråkebo 1:49 property is Elgiganten’s original Nordic distribution centre and is adjacent to the newly built logistics facility that Catena completed for the same tenant in 2024. The acquisition is being undertaken as a corporate transaction with an underlying property value of approximately SEK 1,275 million, subject to the usual deductions for deferred tax. The acquisition is being financed with internal funds and external credit facilities. The seller is a fund managed by Niam. The acquired property is fully leased to Elgiganten until 2033 and is expected to generate a net operating income of approximately SEK 80 million.

The site comprises 232,000 m² of land and the lettable area is approximately 112,000 sqm. The logistics facility, which is certified in accordance with BREEAM In-Use Very Good, has been expanded in several stages. The most recent extension was in 2016, when the 12,000 m² high-bay warehouse was built. The location, in Torsvik industrial area, just south of Jönköping, is considered one of the best logistics locations in the Nordic region. A rail connection to the property is currently being established, and the E4 motorway, one of Sweden’s most vital transportation routes, runs between the rail connection and Catena’s newly constructed logistics facility for Elgiganten. As a result of the acquisition, Catena will own and manage a total of more than 200,000 m² of logistics space, with Elgiganten as the tenant in Torsvik industrial area.

“We are very proud that our outstanding collaboration with Elgiganten is now being further strengthened. Expanding alongside a high-quality facility situated in an optimal logistics location, in partnership with a reliable and established tenant with whom we already have a close working relationship, aligns perfectly with our strategic objectives”, says Jonas Arvidsson, Regional Manager West at Catena.

Elgiganten is one of Sweden’s leading home electronics distributors with its own store network and extensive online sales. The company has expanded its logistical infrastructure in recent years and has shown a high rate of growth.

""We are delighted to hand over a modern and well managed property to a professional player like Catena and we wish them all success in their continued co-operation with Elgiganten”, says Henrik Gerdin, Fund Manager at Niam.

Access will be granted on 1 September 2025.

	ABB signs a long-term service agreement to enhance vessel efficiency and strengthen collaboration on maritime decarbonization 
	Agreement includes maintenance commitment for 33 ships equipped with Azipod&reg; propulsion 


ABB has signed a 15-year service agreement with Royal Caribbean Group, a vacation industry leader with a global fleet of 67 ships across its five brands traveling to all seven continents, deepening the long-standing partnership to support the company&rsquo;s ship performance goals. Covering 33 existing ships, the comprehensive agreement includes preventive maintenance and digital solutions to support and optimize propulsion operations, improve vessel safety, maximize fleet availability, and ensure fast turnaround times for planned Azipod&reg; propulsion servicing. Financial terms were not disclosed.

&ldquo;Our collaboration with Royal Caribbean Group spans nearly three decades, beginning with the installation of Azipod&reg; propulsion on one of the world&rsquo;s largest cruise ships at the time,&rdquo; said Juha Koskela, President of ABB&rsquo;s Marine &amp; Ports division. &ldquo;Since then, we&rsquo;ve partnered on numerous pioneering projects. This service agreement marks an important milestone in our journey together and highlights the critical role of ABB&rsquo;s solutions in modernizing and maintaining the performance of one of the world&rsquo;s most innovative cruise fleets.&rdquo;

&ldquo;This agreement exemplifies how a shared commitment to innovation can unlock new opportunities to improve progress toward ship performance goals,&rdquo; said Palle Laursen, Royal Caribbean Group EVP and Head of Marine.

From its creation over three decades ago to its leading position in shipping today, Azipod&reg; propulsion has revolutionized marine transport by delivering unparalleled gains for performance, efficiency, sustainability and reliability. The gearless, steerable propulsion system, with the electric drive motor in a pod outside the ship&rsquo;s hull, can rotate 360 degrees to increase vessel maneuverability and efficiency, while cutting fuel consumption by up to 20 percent compared to conventional shaftline systems. Since the first installation on a cruise ship over 25 years ago, Azipod&reg; technology has saved more than one million tons of fuel in the cruise segment alone.

ABB is a global technology leader in electrification and automation, enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. By connecting its engineering and digitalization expertise, ABB helps industries run at high performance, while becoming more efficient, productive and sustainable so they outperform. At ABB, we call this &lsquo;Engineered to Outrun&rsquo;. The company has over 140 years of history and around 110,000 employees worldwide. ABB&rsquo;s shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (ABBN) and Nasdaq Stockholm (ABB).&nbsp;www.abb.com

Finnair cancels approximately 100 flights on July 7 due to industrial action – Customers are being contacted directly



The Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) has announced industrial action on Monday, July 7, at Helsinki Airport. If the planned actions are implemented, they will impact all essential ground services related to Finnair flights. 

Due to the planned industrial action, Finnair will have to cancel approximately 100 flights on Monday, July 7. These cancellations will affect the travel plans of roughly 7,200 customers. 

Customers with bookings on July 7 will receive information from Finnair today in case their flight is cancelled. Finnair will contact affected passengers once the cancellations are processed in the system starting today, July 5. After that, customers will receive a new routing based on the contact details in their booking. The new routing will also appear in the Manage Booking service and Finnair’s mobile app. Depending on availability, the proposed new route can be changed via Manage Booking or Customer Service. Alternatively, customers may cancel their trip and request a refund for the ticket. 

Finnair has allowed customers scheduled to travel on July 7 to change their flight date without additional charges, and thousands have taken advantage of this option. 

The IAU has also announced industrial action on July 16, 18, 21, and 23. The potential impacts of these actions are still being assessed but are expected to be smaller than in early July.  Finnair’s Customer Service is unable to provide information about possible flight cancellations on those dates yet, as the impacts are still being assessed. Finnair will notify affected customers directly of cancellations two days before the announced industrial action. 

Finnair apologises for the inconvenience and uncertainty caused by the situation and recommends checking the Finnair website for the latest travel updates at www.finnair.com/travelupdates.

Alfa Laval completes acquisition of cryogenic business from French group Fives

Alfa Laval has completed the acquisition of the cryogenics business unit of Fives (Fives Energy Cryogenics), a world-leading expert in cryogenic heat transfer and pump technologies. This acquisition marks a strategic extension of Alfa Laval's portfolio, underscoring its dedication to pioneering innovative solutions in the energy sector.

The acquisition of Fives Energy Cryogenics introduces a strong technology platform, further positioning Alfa Laval to support the global shift towards cleaner energy. The heat exchangers and pumps developed by Fives Energy Cryogenics are essential for the efficient liquefaction, regasification, and transportation of gases like LNG and hydrogen, as well as industrial gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This capability will extend Alfa Laval's existing offerings in the LNG market and complement Alfa Laval's strengths in hydrogen and carbon capture.

""This acquisition is a strategic milestone for Alfa Laval. By integrating Fives Energy Cryogenics' cutting-edge cryogenic technology to our portfolio, we are not only extending our technological capabilities but also reinforcing our commitment to driving the energy transition. This acquisition positions us at the forefront of innovation in important future markets, enabling sustainable volume growth and value creation,"" says Tom Erixon, CEO and President, Alfa Laval.

Fives Energy Cryogenics has more than 65 years of experience designing and manufacturing cryogenic heat exchangers and pumps for gas liquefaction. The company holds a strong position in the world market with its headquarters in France and manufacturing facilities in France, China and Switzerland. Fives Energy Cryogenics employs more than 700 people and reported approximately EUR 200 million in revenue in 2024.

The cryogenic business will become part of Alfa Laval’s Energy Division and will operate as a new separate business unit. The integration will start immediately.  

The closing of the acquisition was subject to necessary regulatory approvals, as previously communicated here.

2025-07-08,Electrolux Group,Mini documentary “The Home as a Wellness Sanctuary” shows how Electrolux enhances home-life globally,"[*] 
Mini documentary “The Home as a Wellness Sanctuary” shows how Electrolux enhances home-life globally

What does “wellness” mean for different people around the world? Can we improve our daily lives to embrace wellness in the home? At Electrolux, we believe the answer is yes. We partnered with BBC StoryWorks Commercial Productions to create a mini documentary, The Home as a Wellness Sanctuary, for its renowned In Pursuit of Wellness series, presented by the Global Wellness Institute. The film shows how our human-centric innovation and Scandinavian design approach create appliances that simplify life and enhance wellness in millions of homes around the world.  

“It’s great to see the Electrolux story shared with the world in a production that focuses on the value of providing people with rewarding and enriching experiences at home”, says Nikos Bartzoulianos, Electrolux Group CMO and Head of Sustainability, BA Europe APMEA. “The Home as a Wellness Sanctuary does a great job in conveying how our Swedish values deliver the Electrolux Group purpose, to ‘shape living for the better’. From insight and manufacturing to individual product experiences, I’m very proud to see our story told on the BBC’s global platform.” 

The mini documentary demonstrates how Electrolux has always been driven by a deep empathy for real human needs and shows how present-day solutions support sustainable choices; from the maintenance of nutrients and vitamins in food during preservation and meal preparation, to the delivery of smart eco features that lower impact during dish and laundry care. Additionally, with the role of air purification and floor cleaning solutions, it all adds up to show how Electrolux makes the modern home a healthier and more enjoyable place to be.   

Celebrating a rich legacy of societal change 
For more than 100 years, Electrolux has championed social change by innovating appliances that early on liberated women from housework. Led by founder Axel Wenner-Gren, and later by Eva Göthberg who headed the test kitchen in the 1940s, the Electrolux brand’s philosophy has been from the very start to simplify and improve people’s lives in the home.   

Sara Hallin Sandström, Design Director, Brand Expression at Electrolux, features in the documentary and explains why Scandinavian design thinking enhances wellbeing. “How we cook, how we clean, can actually shape how we feel every single day. For me, home care is self-care. It’s about creating a space that supports you without even thinking about it,” she says. “Good design can really help you make the most out of your life and out of your home and can provide a sense of calm or inspiration. It enhances your wellbeing and your connection to the world and those around you.” 

The focus of the Electrolux Design team is to create products that fit in the home in a natural way, using materials that you recognize in the home such as textiles, wood, and leather. By bringing these natural elements into the home, Electrolux expresses its Swedish heritage. It’s a design philosophy that balances function and aesthetics, with the ambition to create objects and spaces that feel as good as they function. 

Elisa Stabon, Head of Product Experience for Product Line Care, works with Electrolux laundry innovations that empower people to make the most sustainable choices for their clothes and the planet, ultimately enhancing their wellbeing. “We know it’s difficult to change habits, like washing in lower temperatures, and we want to support people in doing this. That is why we focus on innovation,” she explains.  

Sustainable laundry solutions include the Smart Select function which adjusts cycle time, along with energy and water use based on how dirty the clothes are, while the Stream Refresh function quickly refreshes clothes to remove wrinkles and save up to 96% of water. In addition, for every cycle set via the brand’s app, the Smart Leaf and Care Meter show how efficient the program is and how gentle it is. 

Our commitment to human centric innovation is as much about the invisible gains – energy efficiency, air quality, saved time – as it is about performance. As homes evolve, so too will our appliances designed to support them. From the kitchen to the laundry room, from purified air to connected living, our vision is clear: to design for a better life. 

The Home as a Wellness Sanctuary is produced by BBC StoryWorks Commercial Productions. Watch the film and learn more on BBC.com here.

If in the UK, the mini documentary is available on the Global Wellness Institute’s website. Visit here.

Epiroc wins large order in Chile for mine trucks and digital solutions 

Stockholm, Sweden: Epiroc AB, a leading productivity and sustainability partner for the mining and infrastructure industries, has won a large order from mining company Sociedad Punta del Cobre SA (Pucobre) in Chile for a significant fleet of underground mine trucks, as well as digital solutions. The equipment and solutions will strengthen Pucobre’s productivity, cost efficiency and safety.  

Pucobre has ordered a large fleet of Minetruck MT65 S haulers, one of the world’s largest underground mine trucks, for use in the company’s copper mines; Punta del Cobre, Granate, and Mantos de Cobre. The Chile-based company, a long-standing customer of Epiroc, also ordered a package of digital solutions that provides, among other things, advanced monitoring and performance tracking of the machine fleet which will boost fleet efficiency and lower emissions.  

The order, including the digital solutions, is valued at around MSEK 235 and was booked in the second quarter 2025. Epiroc will also provide service and spare parts for the equipment. 

“We are happy to strengthen our collaboration with Pucobre further as it upgrades its mines to become even more modern, cost efficient, and sustainable,” says Helena Hedblom, Epiroc’s President and CEO. “By adding on our leading digital solutions, Pucobre will achieve long-term efficiency gains, and even better progress towards its sustainability goals.” 

Sebastián Ríos, Pucobre’s CEO, says: “At Pucobre, we are committed to driving more modern, safer, and more sustainable mining operations. The addition of the MT65 S fleet and Epiroc’s digital solutions will allow us to optimize our processes, reduce costs, and advance our environmental goals with cutting-edge technology.”

Epiroc’s Minetruck MT65 S, with 65 ton load capacity, is engineered with safety, productivity and operator comfort in mind for haulage in larger underground mining and construction operations. 

The digital solution Fleet+ and the add-on solution Fleet+ ShiftGoals ordered by Pucobre provide visibility into machine performance and goal tracking via the My Epiroc interface. Benefits include reduced fuel consumption, improved fleet utilization and increased operator safety. Pucobre also ordered Asset Health Information Service, which delivers high-frequency sensor data and alerts through integration with the customer’s own systems, which in turn supports advanced monitoring and performance tracking of the machine fleet.

Atlas Copco Group receives prestigious award for industrial assembly tool

Nacka, Sweden, July 9, 2025: Atlas Copco Group has received the Red Dot Design Award 2025 for one of its industrial assembly tools, the MTRwrench.

Industrial Technique, a business area within Atlas Copco Group, has been awarded the Red Dot Design Award 2025 for its new torque wrench, the Atlas Copco MTRwrench. The tool has been developed to meet growing demands in industrial assembly for efficiency, ease of use and minimized downtime.

“In a world with limited resources, our customers’ needs tools that help them do more with less. Today’s production environments demand workflow efficiency, minimal interruptions, and consistent quality, while reducing material waste and energy consumption,” said Henrik Elmin, Business Area President Industrial Technique. ”The MTRwrench was developed in direct response to these challenges and is a testament to our commitment to continuous innovation and creating tools that exceed our customers’ expectations regarding efficiency, ergonomics, and performance.""

The award is presented annually for products that demonstrate outstanding design quality and innovation. Modern manufacturing has high demands for process precision and reliability and in this context, assembly tools must deliver consistent performance, support continuous workflows, and be user-friendly across different industrial settings.

The MTRwrench combines a compact and ergonomic design with a range of features, including extended communication range, a responsive click mechanism, and overload reset capabilities on the cradle. A fast battery replacement system and a power bank adapter enable continuous use minimizing downtime in demanding production settings. The MTRwrench includes integrated error-proofing technology to ensure consistent quality and reduce the need for rework. The tool is also constructed using recycled plastic, supporting Atlas Copco Group’s ambition to reduce the environmental impact of its products.

The Red Dot Award ceremony took place on July 8 in Essen, Germany.

2025-07-09,Bavarian Nordic A/S,Bavarian Nordic Enters New Smallpox/Mpox Vaccine Supply Contract with European Country,"Recurring order from an undisclosed European country to strengthen public preparedness.
Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured above DKK 3,000 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus entering the targeted guidance interval for this business.
 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 9, 2025
 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) today announced the award of a contract valued over DKK 200 million to supply its MVA-BN
®
 smallpox/mpox vaccine to a European country. This is another larger order in recent years from the country to strengthen national preparedness against biological threats and epidemics like smallpox and mpox.
 
Paul Chaplin, President & CEO of Bavarian Nordic
, said: “As Europe continues to strengthen its resilience in the face of evolving geopolitical threats, we are proud to support efforts to increase public health security by supplying our MVA-BN
®
 smallpox/mpox vaccine, which remains a vital tool for managing mpox outbreaks as well as for safeguarding populations against future smallpox threats. This new order underscores the growing recognition of biological preparedness as a cornerstone of national and regional security. We remain committed to working with EU and its member states to ensure rapid access to critical medical countermeasures, reinforcing public health infrastructure and contributing to a safer, more secure future. We are also pleased to extend our collaboration with countries outside Europe, demonstrating the value of our long-term partnerships to build and strengthen preparedness.”
 
The order will be delivered in 2025. Along with other orders recently secured from non-European countries, it brings the total value of secured contracts in the Public Preparedness business to slightly above DKK 3,000 million, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this arm of the business for 2025 (DKK 3,000-4,000 million). Total revenue and EBITDA margin for the year remain unchanged at DKK 5,700-6,700 million and 26-30% respectively.

AFRY to conduct Finland’s first Environmental Impact Assessment for a small modular reactor for district heating

Kuopion Energia, a Finnish municipally owned energy utility, is exploring small modular reactors (SMR) as a future solution for low-carbon district heating in Kuopio. AFRY has been chosen to carry out both the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and a constructability study, with results expected in spring 2027.

Kuopion Energia’s existing combined heat and power plant in Haapaniemi is expected to reach the end of its operational lifetime around 2035. An investment decision on a replacement for future district heating provision will be required around 2030. SMRs are among the alternatives under consideration for future heat production. 

AFRY previously conducted a study to identify potential locations for an SMR-based district heating plant in Kuopio. The project has now progressed to the next stage, with AFRY entrusted with delivering a constructability study and environmental impact assessment. 

“Small modular reactors are seen in Kuopio as a promising solution for energy production due to its very low carbon emissions and the stability of fuel pricing,” says Esa Lindholm, CEO of Kuopion Energia.

AFRY will perform a comprehensive EIA to help identify and mitigate potential impacts of the project on the community and the environment, including air, water, soil, fauna and flora. In addition, the scope includes assessments related to nuclear and radiation safety. The process enables participation from local residents and stakeholders through public hearings and consultations.

“As part of the EIA, AFRY will conduct extensive nature surveys, along with specific modelling required for nuclear projects. The EIA is also a prerequisite for submitting the Decision-in-Principle application to the Finnish Government,” says Ilkka Suntio, Project Manager at AFRY.

“Thorough assessment helps reduce uncertainty and prevent surprises during project execution,” adds Petri Turtiainen, Development Manager at Kuopion Energia Oy.

The constructability study, conducted prior to the environmental impact assessment, will evaluate the suitability of the proposed sites for SMR location. This includes geological and geotechnical investigations of soil and bedrock conditions. To verify the quality of the bedrock, AFRY will carry out deep percussion drilling at the selected sites, extending below the intended construction depth of the plant.

Alfa Laval celebrates a century in Japan at the World Expo Osaka

In 1925, Alfa Laval installed its first separator solution in Japan, marking the start of a 100-year journey characterized by sustainability, innovation, and technological advancement. Over the past century, Alfa Laval has contributed to the modernization of Japan, leveraging its expertise in heat transfer, separation, and fluid handling to address key sustainability challenges.

Alfa Laval is proud to celebrate a century in Japan at the World Expo 2025 Osaka. The celebrations took place 9-10 July 2025 at the Nordic Pavilion where Alfa Laval hosted an exclusive gathering for some of its valued Japanese customers. 

“As one of the first European pioneers to establish a presence in Japan, Alfa Laval has become a key player in the country's business and industrial landscape. I am proud to work with Alfa Laval’s cutting-edge technology platform and esteemed customer base to demonstrate how innovation and partnership can accelerate sustainability efforts in such a progressive market,” says Noboru Nishikawa, Managing Director, Alfa Laval Japan.  

Together with customers and media, the Swedish Ambassador to Japan, Viktoria Li, and Alfa Laval’s Head of Sustainability, Anna Celsing, joined the celebration. The event highlighted Alfa Laval’s expertise and industrial solutions that drive key sustainability agendas in Japan and globally.  

“Energy efficiency unlocks resource potential. By scaling existing solutions, we contribute not only to our own targets in Alfa Laval but also to global sustainability goals. This approach allows us to maximize resource utilization and drive meaningful progress across the value chain. At Alfa Laval, we are committed to turning these goals into actionable strategies that deliver tangible results for both our company and the world,” says Anna Celsing, Head of Sustainability at Alfa Laval.  

Alfa Laval was first to introduce centrifugal separators in Japan 

Alfa Laval's journey in Japan began with the introduction of centrifugal separators in 1925. Over the decades, the company has built a robust presence in manufacturing, service, and technology in the country. In the 1920s and 1930s, Alfa Laval entered the Japanese dairy and marine markets with key products, including separators. The 1960s and 1970s saw the expansion of local manufacturing of marine separators and plate heat exchangers. By the 1980s and 1990s, Alfa Laval enhanced its service network with hubs such as the Shonan Centre and strengthened its testing capabilities. In the 2000s, the company continued to expand and upgrade its service centres to better serve local customers. In recent years, Alfa Laval has introduced global innovations like StormGeo to the Japanese market, continually adapting to meet the country's evolving industrial needs. 

Today, Alfa Laval is deeply rooted in Japan, contributing to the optimization of customer processes with four service centres established in Shonan, Osaka, Chugoku and Kyushu. Since its beginnings in separation technology, Alfa Laval has continued to play a crucial role in Japan's energy transition, improving the quality of life and health, and contributing to the decarbonization of the energy sector and shipping industry.

2025-07-11,Axfood,A strong quarter with increased market shares,"[*] 
A strong quarter with increased market shares

Axfood summarises a strong second quarter, with growth significantly outperforming the market. Thanks to affordable and attractive offerings, more and more consumers are choosing to shop with us. Moreover, investments in automation and logistics in recent years are having a positive impact on the Group’s efficiency and competitiveness. Strategic initiatives are also under way to further strengthen the Group’s market presence and the position of the store chains.

President and CEO Simone Margulies comments on the interim report for the second quarter 2025:

“It is clear that a growing number of consumers are choosing to shop with us. Axfood grew significantly more than the market in the second quarter, primarily driven by Willys with the business concept of offering Sweden's cheapest bag of groceries. Retail sales increased 23% in total, or 9% excluding City Gross which was acquired in November last year.

With its strong position as Sweden's most recommended food retail chain, Willys reports strong growth in the quarter that was higher than the market growth on both a total and like-for-like basis. In all, Willys’ sales increased 10%, driven by continued positive volume growth due to high customer traffic and customer loyalty. Hemköp reported a good performance in the traditional grocery segment with growth of 6%, and Snabbgross continued to successfully navigate a weak restaurant and café market, also delivering 6% growth.

City Gross has great potential and gives us presence in the hypermarket segment, an attractive market segment that the Group has not previously been present in. Growth for the quarter amounted to 3%. This year marks a year of transition, and we are working according to our plan to strengthen the store chain for the future and achieve profitability at some point in the second half of 2026.

With both Easter and Midsummer taking place during the quarter, Dagab is summarising a good quarter with large volumes, improved productivity and increased market investments to support its customers. Work also continued to optimise processes and flows at the highly automated logistics centre in Bålsta, which has been fully operational since the spring. As previously communicated, Dagab is also planning for the next stage in the development of the logistics structure in order to create even more capacity and further improve efficiency in southern Sweden from 2030.

With a significant increase in customer traffic, high growth and logistics efficiency improvements, the Group's earnings increased. Initiatives to improve the efficiency of our support functions were implemented during the quarter. The efficiency gains will lead to annual cost savings of approximately SEK 80 m from 2026, creating the conditions for the Group to continue investing in price value and enhancing its competitiveness.

Renewable energy is an important area when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint. During the quarter, we officially opened Sweden’s largest solar park. In addition, the phase-out of fossil fuel in the Group’s transports continued during the quarter through an increased use of renewable fuels.

We summarise a strong quarter in which we grew more than the market and continued to attract both existing and new customers. We are seeing positive momentum in Willys, Hemköp and Snabbgross, and are working to improve City Gross. Our base operations have become more competitive thanks to our new logistics platform, and we continue to maintain a high tempo in our strategic initiatives in many areas. We have a high ambition level and development rate in order to further strengthen our positions – always with the customer meeting in focus.”

",unknown,A strong quarter with increased market shares,"[*] A strong quarter with increased market shares Axfood summarises a strong second quarter, with growth significantly outperforming the market. Thanks to affordable and attractive offerings, more and more consumers are choosing to shop with us. Moreover, investments in automation and logistics in recent years are having a positive impact on the Group’s efficiency and competitiveness. Strategic initiatives are also under way to further strengthen the Group’s market presence and the position of the store chains. President and CEO Simone Margulies comments on the interim report for the second quarter 2025: “It is clear that a growing number of consumers are choosing to shop with us. Axfood grew significantly more than the market in the second quarter, primarily driven by Willys with the business concept of offering Sweden's cheapest bag of groceries. Retail sales increased 23% in total, or 9% excluding City Gross which was acquired in November last year. With its strong position as Sweden's most recommended food retail chain, Willys reports strong growth in the quarter that was higher than the market growth on both a total and like-for-like basis. In all, Willys’ sales increased 10%, driven by continued positive volume growth due to high customer traffic and customer loyalty. Hemköp reported a good performance in the traditional grocery segment with growth of 6%, and Snabbgross continued to successfully navigate a weak restaurant and café market, also delivering 6% growth. City Gross has great potential and gives us presence in the hypermarket segment, an attractive market segment that the Group has not previously been present in. Growth for the quarter amounted to 3%. This year marks a year of transition, and we are working according to our plan to strengthen the store chain for the future and achieve profitability at some point in the second half of 2026. With both Easter and Midsummer taking place during the quarter, Dagab is summarising a good quarter with large volumes, improved productivity and increased market investments to support its customers. Work also continued to optimise processes and flows at the highly automated logistics centre in Bålsta, which has been fully operational since the spring. As previously communicated, Dagab is also planning for the next stage in the development of the logistics structure in order to create even more capacity and further improve efficiency in southern Sweden from 2030. With a significant increase in customer traffic, high growth and logistics efficiency improvements, the Group's earnings increased. Initiatives to improve the efficiency of our support functions were implemented during the quarter. The efficiency gains will lead to annual cost savings of approximately SEK 80 m from 2026, creating the conditions for the Group to continue investing in price value and enhancing its competitiveness. Renewable energy is an important area when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint. During the quarter, we officially opened Sweden’s largest solar park. In addition, the phase-out of fossil fuel in the Group’s transports continued during the quarter through an increased use of renewable fuels. We summarise a strong quarter in which we grew more than the market and continued to attract both existing and new customers. We are seeing positive momentum in Willys, Hemköp and Snabbgross, and are working to improve City Gross. Our base operations have become more competitive thanks to our new logistics platform, and we continue to maintain a high tempo in our strategic initiatives in many areas. We have a high ambition level and development rate in order to further strengthen our positions – always with the customer meeting in focus.” Second quarter summary * Net sales increased 9.3% to SEK 22,995 m (21,044). * Retail sales increased 22.9% to SEK 20,282 m (16,509).

2025-07-11,Bravida Holding AB,Interim Report April–June 2025,"[*] 
Interim Report April–June 2025

Improved EBITA margin and growing order backlog

• Net sales decreased by 9 percent, to SEK 6,974 (7,694) million
• The order backlog was SEK 16,854 (17,559) million
• EBITA increased by 10 percent, to SEK 378 (343) million
• The EBITA margin increased to 5.4 (4.5) percent
• Profit after tax increased by 12 percent, to SEK 269 (240) million
• Cash flow from operating activities was SEK 123 (548) million
• Net debt amounted to SEK -3,131 (-2,518) million
• One acquisition was completed during the quarter, adding annual sales of approximately SEK 346 million
• Basic and diluted earnings per share increased by 13 percent, to SEK 1.31 (1.16)

CEO statement
Through our continued project selection, the EBITA margin improved in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. We report satisfactory earnings in Denmark, where developments are going as planned, and I expect a continuing gradual improvement going forward. Although demand in the Nordic market remains low, I note that market activities are improving in several locations and interesting customer dialogues are ongoing. The order backlog increased in Norway and Denmark during the quarter.

Net sales and EBITA
I am pleased that we, in a challenging market have increased both our margin and our earnings despite lower sales. Important factors for the margin development are our focus on margin before volume and the current project mix. Additional factors include our focus on restrictive project selection, cost control and pricing, as well as efficient production.

Over the past year, our restrictive project selection has resulted in lower sales for both service and installation. However, this is a priority we are pleased to have, in order to be able to maintain the necessary balance between a focus on profitability and risk exposure. The variation in the market between different geographic areas is significant. Demand remains weak in the southern parts of Sweden and in the Finnish market, but also in other local markets. We continuously adapt our resources to the current market situation.

The order backlog increased by almost SEK 1.3bn during the quarter, driven by a strong order intake in Denmark. The order backlog points to a stable installation volume in the coming quarters. 

The weak market situation in southern Sweden continues to have a negative impact on sales and profitability in the Swedish business. The business in southern Sweden lost 18 percent of its volume compared to the second quarter of 2024, corresponding to approximately SEK 230 million. Adjustments made to the organisation in southern Sweden have stabilised the EBITA margin, which is still at a low level. Other business operations in Sweden are stable.

The Norwegian operations improved its project margins, which resulted in an improved EBITA margin. Organic growth was negative, as we had high production in a number of large projects in 2024. The project market in Norway remains challenging and it is important to keep adhering to our strategy of margin before volume.

The Danish operations continues to develop in a positive direction. During the quarter, profitability improved significantly; this is in line with my previously communicated expectations. I expect a continuous improvement in profitability in the coming quarters, as new orders have good margins and sales from old loss-making projects are gradually decreasing. My assessment is that we will increase the EBITA margin close to 5 percent in 2025. 

The Finnish operations experienced a decrease of 15 percent in sales, but despite this decrease we managed to achieve acceptable profitability by adapting the organisation and costs to the current market situation.

Cash flow
Cash flow from operating activities and cash conversion declined. This was mainly due to an increase in accrued but not yet billed revenue in a large infrastructure project with a public sector client. The agreement with the customer stipulates that certain milestones have to be reached before invoicing can take place, and I expect this will occur in the second half of 2025.

Acquisitions
During the quarter, one acquisition was completed, which added annual sales of approximately SEK 346 million; at the beginning of the third quarter another acquisition was completed and this added annual sales of approximately SEK 45 million. As always, we focus on selecting the right acquisition candidates, which have a suitable culture and create value for Bravida. At present, identifying good acquisition targets is difficult, due to the weak and uncertain market conditions, but I want to emphasise that interesting acquisition discussions are ongoing continuously.

Sustainability
At Bravida, we take a long-term approach to sustainability in order to be a preferred supplier to our customers, an attractive employer and a leading stakeholder in the industry. I am very proud of the dedicated work we are putting into reducing workplace injuries is paying off. The LTIFR improved to 5.2, which is better than our current target of 5.5. The electrification of our vehicle fleet is reducing our own carbon footprint, and during the last 12 months we have reduced emissions from our vehicles by 15 percent, and by 40 percent from 2020 in relation to sales.

Outlook
For Bravida, I believe that the demand for service will remain stable. The installation volume will gradually improve, and benefit from a need for renovations, and investments in infrastructure, electrification and defence facilities. I have noticed a significantly better activity in the market, with more enquiries and interesting discussions, not least relating to infrastructure. However, there are considerable geographical differences in the demand for installation work relating to new builds. The markets in southern Sweden and Finland are still weak, whereas the market situation in the rest of Sweden, Denmark and Norway is generally stable, but with considerable geographical differences. We generally expect a continuing uncertain and hesitant market in 2025, impacted by the weak construction market and increased uncertainty in the world in general. For 2026–2027, the outlook is brighter, with increased demand for installation in new builds and renovation projects, according to third-party forecasts.

Comment by the CEO

Stable core business and focused measures for long-term strength
During the first half of 2025, we implemented several strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening Corem for the future, while at the same time maintaining stability in our core business. We delivered positive net letting for the quarter and are seeing results of our focused cost-control efforts. Through efficient property management, targeted capital measures and a successive streamlining of the property portfolio, we are aiming to create scope for continued value generation in a business environment which remains characterised by uncertainty.

Business environment under change
We continue to operating in a challenging business environment, but where signs of stabilisation are beginning to appear. Inflation this last quarter has risen somewhat but before that been stable at a lower level for several quarters. Interest rates however remain at relatively high levels, particularly in the US. At the same time, geopolitics and a cautious economy are impacting the global investment climate. For the property sector, this has entailed a high degree of uncertainty, with volatility in both capital expenses and demand for new premises. How­ever, during the quarter, we saw a gradual improvement in margins and the transaction climate. 

In this environment, our strategy has been clear, to continue creating value through efficient property management, active portfolio management and financial consolidation. These are measures that will strengthen Corem for the future – but also give us scope for manoeuvre here and now.

Operational stability and continued business drive
The net operating income in a comparable portfolio for the first six months was in line with the preceding year and costs declined by 4 per cent. It is particularly gratifying that net letting was positive during the quarter. We regard this as a clear sign of strength given the current market situation, in which there is major competition in the relatively weak rental market. Net letting amounted to SEK 10 million for the second quarter, a testament of our ability to create premises which match demand and our long-term focus on maintianting a strong customer offering. During the quarter we signed several leases, including with Norrköping Municipality for 3,300 square metres,  seven year lease with Smartoptics who are expanding by 1,800 to for 4,200 square metres in Kista and with Region Stockholm for 1,700 square metres in the Globen area. In New York, an agreement was signed with a finance company for approximately 600 square metres in the 1245 Broadway project property.

On the cost side, we are taking decisive steps toward continued efficiency of our operating costs. Although also helped by a mild winter at the start of the year, we also see  measures to optimise operations and energy consumption are having continuous impact on the portfolio. 

Strategic divestments – toward a more focused portfolio
During the second quarter we have undertaken several major divestments aimed at freeing up capital,  decrease risk and focus our portfolio geographically. In June, we announced the sale of a portfolio of five properties to Castellum, at an underlying property value of approximately SEK 1.7 billion. The portfolio comprises of office and hotel properties in Örebro, Linköping and Uppsala – strong locations, but where these objects are generally fully developed properties and, accordingly, suitable for divestment. Through the divestment of these properties, we are leaving Örebro entirely, which also entails geographic streamlining for us.

In parallel, we have agreed on the divestment of a property in New York, 28&7, which marks the next step in the gradual discontinuation of our project commitment in the US. The 28&7 project will result in a net earnings effect of SEK –215 million. Naturally, we are far from satisfied with this outcome, but which for this project is attributable to a challenging combination of negative market conditions during the project period. This was approximately two years longer than planned, mainly due to the pandemic which more or less paralysed the US property market for a couple of years, but also made more costly due to higher financing costs and increased yield requirements as a result of higher interest rates than those that prevailed at the start of the project in 2019. Our other ongoing project in the US, 1245 Broadway, is holding up better financially thanks to higher average rental levels and longer lease durations. 

Divestment in the US is also a logical step on our established path – to primarily focus our resources in Sweden, particularly in growth locations where we foresee long-term demand and potential.

During the first half of the year, Corem’s total divestments and agreed divestments totalled nearly SEK 3.5 billion in underlying property value, with a total net earnings effect of approximately SEK –135 million.

Our objective — to divest properties for more than SEK 5 billion during the year — stands firm and we have already made good progress in this regard. We are seeing continued interest in our properties from both Swedish and international investors and although transaction volumes are generally lower than in prior years, there is demand for high-quality, sustainable properties in urban hubs, which provides us room to  manoeuvre. 

Financial strengthening and capital measures
Some of our most important initiatives during the first half of the year were aimed at strengthening the balance sheet. In February, we redeemed bonds for approximately SEK 1.4 billion and a US loan of approximately SEK 500 million, while also issuing a new green bond of SEK 1 billion with maturity in 2028. 

In addition, in June, we implemented a directed new share issue of 192 million shares of Series B, which generates SEK 939 million including also the second tranche which is subject to approval at the coming extra general meeting. The new issue is aimed at improving our capital structure, reduce net liabilities and create conditions to redeem the outstanding hybrid bond of SEK 1.1 billion.

The results of several major refinancings are visible in our capital tie-up, where the volume maturing in 2025 has decreased from approximately 18 billion at the start of the year to 5 billion as of the end of June. During the second quarter we also restructured interest rate swaps of approximately 3 billion, which has had a positive impact on the fixed interest rate. In addition, new swaps of 1 billion were signed during the quarter, at good levels. 

During the quarter, we also sold parts of our holding in Klövern, where we now remain with an ownership of approximately 8 per cent. 

These financial measures improve our financial position in the long term and we are gradually moving forward toward our targets, with conditions to develop values through our portfolio. 

Focus ahead
Our work to strengthen the balance sheet is by no means complete. We will continue along the established path and for continued optimization. 

The business environment is challenging, but we stand well equipped ahead of the second half of the year with a more focused portfolio and continued stable letting. Adding a strengthened financial foundation, which benefits further from our aim to redeem the hybrid bond as well as our continued work with the portfolio. 

We now leave an eventfgul first half of the year behind us, where we have acted with focus on the long term, and move forward with good conditions to create increasing shareholder value.

",unknown,Interim Report January-June 2025,"[*] Interim Report January-June 2025 * Income amounted to SEK 1,792 million (1,882) * Operating surplus amounted to SEK 1,166 million (1,223) * Net financial income amounted to SEK –619 million (–622) * Profit from property management amounted to SEK 476 million (517) * Changes in value of properties amounted to SEK –761 million (–485) * Net profit/loss for the period amounted to SEK –578 million (6), corresponding to SEK –0.70 (–0.25) per ordinary share of class A and B * Net letting amounted to SEK 10 million (37) for the quarter and to SEK –27 million (87) for the period * The value of the investment properties amounted to SEK 51,663 million (55,205) * Net asset value (NAV) per ordinary share of class A and B amounted to SEK 13.44 (15.97) EVENTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER * During the quarter, 9 properties were divested at an underlying property value of SEK 1,851 million. The divestments in the quarter include a property portfolio comprising five properties located in Linköping, Uppsala and Örebro, whereupon Corem is thus leaving Örebro. * Agreement was signed for sale of the project property 28&7 in New York at an underlying property value of approximately SEK 770 million with divestment during the third quarter. * A directed new issue was carried out of Corem’s ordinary shares of class B in two separate issue resolutions. One is the directed issue of 110,032,787 ordinary shares of class B to Swedish and international institutional investors, the other is one a directed issue of 81,967,213 ordinary shares of class B to M2 Asset Management AB (publ). The latter is provided approval by an Extraordinary General Meeting, which will be held on 21 July 2025. Corem intends to use the net proceeds to create the conditions from the directed new share issues to repay the outstanding hybrid bond. * Corem divested parts of its holding in Klövern AB, which means that Corem’s ownership share is reduced from 17 per cent to 8 per cent. The divestment has a profit impact of SEK –238 million in the quarter. Comment by the CEO Stable core business and focused measures for long-term strength During the first half of 2025, we implemented several strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening Corem for the future, while at the same time maintaining stability in our core business. We delivered positive net letting for the quarter and are seeing results of our focused cost-control efforts. Through efficient property management, targeted capital measures and a successive streamlining of the property portfolio, we are aiming to create scope for continued value generation in a business environment which remains characterised by uncertainty. Business environment under change We continue to operating in a challenging business environment, but where signs of stabilisation are beginning to appear. Inflation this last quarter has risen somewhat but before that been stable at a lower level for several quarters. Interest rates however remain at relatively high levels, particularly in the US. At the same time, geopolitics and a cautious economy are impacting the global investment climate. For the property sector, this has entailed a high degree of uncertainty, with volatility in both capital expenses and demand for new premises. How­ever, during the quarter, we saw a gradual improvement in margins and the transaction climate. In this environment, our strategy has been clear, to continue creating value through efficient property management, active portfolio management and financial consolidation. These are measures that will strengthen Corem for the future – but also give us scope for manoeuvre here and now. Operational stability and continued business drive The net operating income in a comparable portfolio for the first six months was in line with the preceding year and costs declined by 4 per cent. It is particularly gratifying that net letting was positive during the quarter. We regard this as a clear sign of strength given the current market situation, in which there is major competition in the relatively weak rental market. Net letting amounted to SEK 10 million for the second quarter, a testament of our ability to create premises which match demand and our long-term focus on maintianting a strong customer offering. During the quarter we signed several leases, including with Norrköping Municipality for 3,300 square metres, seven year lease with Smartoptics who are expanding by 1,800 to for 4,200 square metres in Kista and with Region Stockholm for 1,700 square metres in the Globen area. In New York, an agreement was signed with a finance company for approximately 600 square metres in the 1245 Broadway project property. On the cost side, we are taking decisive steps toward continued efficiency of our operating costs. Although also helped by a mild winter at the start of the year, we also see measures to optimise operations and energy consumption are having continuous impact on the portfolio. Strategic divestments – toward a more focused portfolio During the second quarter we have undertaken several major divestments aimed at freeing up capital, decrease risk and focus our portfolio geographically. In June, we announced the sale of a portfolio of five properties to Castellum, at an underlying property value of approximately SEK 1.7 billion. The portfolio comprises of office and hotel properties in Örebro, Linköping and Uppsala – strong locations, but where these objects are generally fully developed properties and, accordingly, suitable for divestment. Through the divestment of these properties, we are leaving Örebro entirely, which also entails geographic streamlining for us. In parallel, we have agreed on the divestment of a property in New York, 28&7, which marks the next step in the gradual discontinuation of our project commitment in the US. The 28&7 project will result in a net earnings effect of SEK –215 million. Naturally, we are far from satisfied with this outcome, but which for this project is attributable to a challenging combination of negative market conditions during the project period. This was approximately two years longer than planned, mainly due to the pandemic which more or less paralysed the US property market for a couple of years, but also made more costly due to higher financing costs and increased yield requirements as a result of higher interest rates than those that prevailed at the start of the project in 2019. Our other ongoing project in the US, 1245 Broadway, is holding up better financially thanks to higher average rental levels and longer lease durations. Divestment in the US is also a logical step on our established path – to primarily focus our resources in Sweden, particularly in growth locations where we foresee long-term demand and potential. During the first half of the year, Corem’s total divestments and agreed divestments totalled nearly SEK 3.5 billion in underlying property value, with a total net earnings effect of approximately SEK –135 million. Our objective — to divest properties for more than SEK 5 billion during the year — stands firm and we have already made good progress in this regard. We are seeing continued interest in our properties from both Swedish and international investors and although transaction volumes are generally lower than in prior years, there is demand for high-quality, sustainable properties in urban hubs, which provides us room to manoeuvre. Financial strengthening and capital measures Some of our most important initiatives during the first half of the year were aimed at strengthening the balance sheet. In February, we redeemed bonds for approximately SEK 1.4 billion and a US loan of approximately SEK 500 million, while also issuing a new green bond of SEK 1 billion with maturity in 2028. In addition, in June, we implemented a directed new share issue of 192 million shares of Series B, which generates SEK 939 million including also the second tranche which is subject to approval at the coming extra general meeting. The new issue is aimed at improving our capital structure, reduce net liabilities and create conditions to redeem the outstanding hybrid bond of SEK 1.1 billion. The results of several major refinancings are visible in our capital tie-up, where the volume maturing in 2025 has decreased from approximately 18 billion at the start of the year to 5 billion as of the end of June. During the second quarter we also restructured interest rate swaps of approximately 3 billion, which has had a positive impact on the fixed interest rate. In addition, new swaps of 1 billion were signed during the quarter, at good levels. During the quarter, we also sold parts of our holding in Klövern, where we now remain with an ownership of approximately 8 per cent. These financial measures improve our financial position in the long term and we are gradually moving forward toward our targets, with conditions to develop values through our portfolio. Focus ahead Our work to strengthen the balance sheet is by no means complete. We will continue along the established path and for continued optimization. The business environment is challenging, but we stand well equipped ahead of the second half of the year with a more focused portfolio and continued stable letting. Adding a strengthened financial foundation, which benefits further from our aim to redeem the hybrid bond as well as our continued work with the portfolio. We now leave an eventfgul first half of the year behind us, where we have acted with focus on the long term, and move forward with good conditions to create increasing shareholder value. I now want to wish you a pleasant summer and extend warm thanks to all employees, tenants and shareholders who continuously contribute to Corem’s development.

INVESTOR NEWS no. 22 - 11 July 2025
 
 
Ferry – freight:
 Total volumes in June 2025 of 3.4m lane metres were 1.7%* below 2024 and down 3.7% adjusted for route changes. YTD growth rates were -0.2% and -1.3%, respectively.
 
North Sea volumes were below 2024 driven primarily by a negative impact from a national strike in Sweden impacting Gothenburg port operations. Mediterranean volumes were below 2024 following capacity reductions due to new ferry competition between Türkiye and Italy.
 
Channel volumes were below 2024, adjusted for the new Jersey routes, partly due to a decrease in the total Dover Strait market. Baltic Sea volumes were on level with 2024. Strait of Gibraltar volumes were above 2024.
 
For the last twelve months 2025-24, the total transported freight lane metres increased 3.7% to 41.5m from 40.0m in 2024-23. The increase was 0.3% adjusted for route changes.
 
Ferry – passenger:
 The number of passengers in June 2025 was adjusted for route changes** down 7.1% to 414k vs 2024 and the adjusted YTD growth rate was -4.4%. The monthly decrease was driven by lower Channel volumes. The number of cars in June was 9.3% below 2024 adjusted for route changes.
 
For the last twelve months 2025-24, the total number of passengers increased 10.4% to 6.1m compared to 5.5m for 2024-23. The growth rate was -0.7% adjusted for route changes.
 
*Adjusted for a correction to previous months of Strait of Gibraltar volumes reported in June 2024. **Adjusted for sale of Oslo-Frederikshavn-Copenhagen end October 2025, Tarifa-Tanger Ville due to considerable capacity changes ahead of exit from route early June 2025, and addition of Jersey routes from end March 2025.

Palta and IAU reached negotiation result – announced strikes called off



The Service Sector Employers Palta and the Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) have today, July 13, 2025, approved the settlement proposal presented late last night by the National Conciliator. The proposal forms the basis for a new collective agreement for aviation services.

The new agreement will be in effect for approximately 1.5 years, ending on January 15, 2027. The proposed wage solution aligns with the general labor market framework.

As a result of the agreement, the planned strikes announced by IAU for July 16, 18, 21, 23, and 25 have been cancelled, and Finnair will operate its flights according to the normal schedule.

“Sincere thanks to our customers for their patience during this prolonged labour dispute. With the negotiation result covering Finnair’s Technical Services, Kitchen, airport customer service, and many other companies operating in the airport area, we can now focus on operating our flights during this important summer travel season with the reliability customers expect from us,” says Jaakko Schildt, Chief Operating Officer at Finnair.

AFRY to acquire Reta Engenharia, a Brazilian industry leader in project and construction management services

AFRY has entered into an agreement to acquire Reta Engenharia (Reta), a Brazilian provider of comprehensive project and construction management services, with a leading foothold in the mining and metals sector. With more than 200 employees, Reta brings strong local expertise that will further strengthen AFRY’s capabilities within core industrial sectors in the Americas.

Reta has established itself as a leading provider of high value-added services, with recognized expertise in project management and controls during early development phases, as well as in construction management and site supervision. The company operates across multiple industries in Brazil and manages a robust portfolio of capital investment projects as well as local operational services.

Reta’s strong local presence and core competencies will enhance AFRY’s existing operations which includes over 1,200 employees in Brazil, unlocking new growth opportunities across the Americas. As mining and metals are essential to meeting the increasing demand for materials critical to industrial transformation, this acquisition further reinforces AFRY’s role in advancing the global energy and industrial transition.

“This is a strategic step for AFRY as we expand our footprint in the Americas. Brazil plays a vital role in sustainable industrial development, and Reta’s capabilities will strengthen our position from the early stages of client projects. Combining their niche expertise with AFRY’s global platform creates a strong foundation for future growth in the region”, says Nicholas Oksanen, EVP and Head of Global Division Industry at AFRY.

“Joining AFRY defines a new and important chapter in the history of Reta Engenharia. We share a strong vision of technical excellence, sustainable development, and the promotion of shared value for clients and employees. This milestone strengthens our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions, expands professional growth opportunities for our team, and reinforces our commitment to transforming knowledge into a lasting legacy for society”, Marcus Cassini, CEO, Reta Engenharia. 

Reta’s net sales in 2024 amounted to approximately SEK 135 million. The acquisition is subject to operational closing conditions and is expected to close during Q3 2025.

Comments from the CEO Linda Pålsson: 

“The second quarter was marked by a continued cautious market and a weak calendar. This was reflected in AFRY’s results, with a decline in net sales and a calendar-adjusted EBITA margin in line with last year. While the global economy is recovering more slowly than expected, our order backlog increased during the quarter. 

Our strategic efforts during the quarter focused on implementing the new Group structure that came into effect on July 1, 2025. This has entailed a comprehensive restructuring of the organization, including support functions, to streamline operations and enable us to address our cost base going forward. This has resulted in redundancies with related restructuring costs during the quarter. As we continue to optimize the portfolio and address our cost base, we expect further restructuring costs in the range of SEK 200-300 million over the next 12 months. We are expecting the payback time of these restructuring efforts to be on average one year.

With the new Group structure, we have laid the foundations for focused strategic development in our core segments. I look forward to presenting our updated strategy and plan for profitable growth at AFRY’s Capital Markets Day on November 4, 2025.”

Ericsson reports second quarter results 2025

Strategic highlights – solid strategic and operational execution 

 * 
Operational excellence led to a 48% adjusted[1] gross margin and a three-year high in adjusted[1] EBITA margin.  

 * 
Solid strategic execution in Cloud Software and Services delivered strong segment adjusted[1] EBITA.  

 * 
Strong progress in IPR licensing; further opportunities to increase IPR revenues remain.  

Financial highlights – improved contribution from all segments 

 * 
Sales grew by 2%*, driven by market area Americas and IPR licensing, partly offset by declines in other market areas, with investments in India on hold. Reported sales were SEK 56.1 (59.8) b., with a SEK -4.7 b. FX impact.  

 * 
Adjusted[1] gross income increased to SEK 27.0 (26.3) b. driven by strong operational execution and higher IPR licensing revenues, benefiting from a settlement. Reported gross income was SEK 26.6 (25.8) b.  

 * 
Adjusted[1] gross margin was 48.0% (43.9%) supported by improvements in all segments, despite currency headwinds. Reported gross margin was 47.5% (43.1%).  

 * 
Adjusted[1] EBITA was SEK 7.4 (4.1) b. with a 13.2% (6.8%) margin, benefiting from higher gross income and lower operating expenses. Reported EBITA was SEK 6.8 (2.4) b. with a 12.0% (4.1%) margin.  

 * 
Net income was SEK 4.6 (-11.0) b. EPS diluted was SEK 1.37 (-3.34). Net income in 2024 was impacted by a SEK -11.4 b. impairment charge.  

 * 
Free cash flow before M&A was SEK 2.6 (7.6) b. Q2 2024 benefited from strong working capital release. 

Börje Ekholm, President and CEO, said: “Our Q2 results demonstrate solid execution of our strategic and operational priorities. We achieved a three-year high in adjusted EBITA margin, supported by continued efficiency actions. We have structurally lowered our cost base and are strongly focused on delivering further efficiencies.  

It is encouraging that Americas’ growth continues, and that Europe has stabilized. Global fixed wireless access (FWA) customers have now surpassed 160 million and are driving significant network traffic. Penetration of 5G standalone is still limited but is needed to fully support AI use cases at the edge, requiring ultra-low latency and enhanced uplink performance.  

Looking ahead, we are increasing AI investments, including in our Sweden AI factory consortium. AI is key to accelerating innovation, as well as driving internal operational efficiencies. The ecosystem for network APIs continues to grow, and Aduna expanded its Network API reach to all three major service providers in Japan.”

CEO Topi Manner: Strong growth in EBITDA and cash flow

In the second quarter, revenue grew by 2 per cent to EUR 552 million. The growth in revenue was affected by a EUR 12 million decrease in low-margin equipment sales, including a one-off, EUR 7 million deal in Estonia in the comparison quarter. Comparable EBITDA improved by 4 per cent to EUR 198 million, boosted by continuous improvements in efficiency. Comparable cash flow grew by 20 per cent, driven by growing EBITDA, positive net working capital change and strict CAPEX discipline. Relative to many other industries, Elisa’s business will remain stable in uncertain geopolitical times, even though we are not immune to all customer impacts. 

During the second quarter, we launched a significant upgrade to our consumer voice subscriptions, which now include a suite of security features: mobile ID, scam site blocking and data leakage monitoring. This upgrade was well received by customers, as witnessed by the decreasing overall churn rate, and resulted in an improved growth rate in mobile service revenue. We will continue the rollout of the upgraded offering during the remainder of the year and beyond. 

We became the first operator in the world to offer customers mobile subscriptions using 5.5G (5G Advanced) technology. We announced an agreement with Nokia on the extension of the 5.5G networks in Finland and Estonia. 

We were also the first operator in Europe to achieve download speeds of up to 8 Gbps with carrier aggregation in the 5G Standalone network in Finland, together with Ericsson and MediaTek. In Estonia, Ookla rated Elisa's 5G network as the fastest. 

To further enhance efficiency, resilience and customer experience, we announced expanded collaboration with Google Cloud to enable the implementation of AI-driven autonomous network operations.

In the Corporate Customers business, we gained significant new customer wins. In IT services, the number of workstations covered by Elisa’s AI-enhanced service will increase by 40 per cent during 2025, strengthening our position among the top four IT service companies in Finland. For our B2B customers, we launched Moontalk AIRI, an AI-assisted service for companies that provides automatic note-taking and call summaries for phone calls. 

In International Software Services, we had several customer wins, especially in the telecom industry. As a result, comparable organic growth for the quarter was 10 per cent. The launch of Elisa Industriq brand continued during the quarter.

Elisa’s long-term sustainability work continued to gain international recognition. In the latest report from Time Magazine and Statista, Elisa ranked as the 55th most sustainable company in the world. We were also included in the Financial Times and Statista Europe’s Best Employers ranking.

Our performance during the second quarter clearly demonstrates our strong commitment to faster profitable growth, creating customer value by being a frontrunner in technology, and continuously improving our productivity and quality.

Outlook and guidance for 2025  

The development in the general economy includes many uncertainties. Growth in the Finnish economy is expected to be weak. In particular, there is continuing uncertainty relating to Russia’s war in Ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts. Challenges in global supply chains may also result in uncertainties in volumes and prices. Competition in the Finnish telecommunications market remains keen.

Full-year revenue is estimated to be at the same level as or slightly higher than in 2024. Mobile, digital and software services are expected to increase revenue. Full-year comparable EBITDA is anticipated to be at the same level as or slightly higher than in 2024. Capital expenditure is expected to be a maximum of 12 per cent of revenue.

Elisa continues to improve productivity, for example by increasing automation and data analytics in different processes, such as customer interaction, network operations and delivery. Additionally, Elisa’s continuous quality improvement measures will increase customer satisfaction and efficiency and reduce costs.

Elisa’s transformation into a provider of exciting, new and relevant services for its customers is continuing. Long-term revenue growth and profitability improvement will derive from growth in the mobile data market, as well as domestic digital and international software services.

2025-07-15,Dometic Group AB,Dometic Group AB - REPORT ON THE SECOND QUARTER 2025,"















ROBUST EBITA MARGIN AND STRONG CASH FLOW IN A CHALLENGING MARKET


SECOND QUARTER 2025




Net sales were SEK 6,269 m (7,662); a decrease of -18%. Organic growth was -11%. 


Operating profit (EBITA) before items affecting comparability was SEK 877 m (1,069), corresponding to a margin of 14.0% (14.0%).


Operating profit (EBIT) was SEK 743 m (903), corresponding to a margin of 11.9% (11.8%).


Profit for the period was SEK 348 m (443).


Earnings per share were SEK 1.09 (1.39). Adjusted earnings per share were SEK 1.38 (1.76).


Free cash flow was SEK 1,302 m (1,395) during the quarter. Cash flow was SEK 392 m (990). 






CEO COMMENT


“Dometic delivered a robust double-digit EBITA1 margin and strong cash flow in the second quarter, despite a more uncertain macroeconomic environment due to the ongoing global trade conflict. 


Net sales in the quarter totaled SEK 6,269 m (7,662), resulting in an organic net sales decline of 11 percent. Revenue in the Service & Aftermarket channel ended below expectations in the quarter showing a decline of 12 percent organically compared to a relatively strong quarter last year. Weaker end consumer confidence has led to a more careful approach to replacement and upgrades, leading to retailers continuing to be cautious with inventory levels, and delaying the gradual recovery we had expected to see. Organic net sales for the Distribution channel was down 7 percent impacted by generally bad weather in the US during the quarter as well as a temporary production stop in our US mobile cooling plant. We estimate that around half the decline in the quarter was attributable to the production stop. The OEM sales channel showed an organic net sales decline of 14 percent in line with expectations. However, we have seen organic net sales growth in LV Americas through the OEM sales channel for two consecutive quarters. 


The EBITA margin was 14.0 percent (14.0) which is on par with the second quarter last year. Despite lower net sales, the savings generated by the ongoing Global restructuring program combined with other cost containment measures have yielded positive impacts on our profitability. The EBITA margin improvements are mainly shown in the Land Vehicles and Mobile Cooling Solutions segments, where we saw improved EBITA margins year-over-year. In the Land Vehicles segment, EMEA and Americas are driving the improvements while APAC continues to show high margins but still below last year. The Marine Segment shows a robust EBITA-margin, but below last year driven by lower net sales.


Free cash flow continued to be strong at SEK 1,302 m (1,395) primarily driven by improvements in working capital. The net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio remained flat at 3.3x and increased year-on-year by 0.4x due to weaker development of EBITDA, partially compensated by free cash flow and currency effects. We are maintaining a strong focus on profitability and cash flow across the Group and remain committed to achieving our net debt to EBITDA target of around 2.5x. Due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty it is difficult to assess the timing of when we can achieve this target. 


Dometic's transformative journey is progressing positively. We have taken significant steps in shifting the focus from a regionally led approach to a global product-led approach. We continue to invest in product innovation and sales capabilities in our strategic growth areas. The product innovation index reached 22 percent in the quarter representing a year-over-year improvement from 19 percent, and demonstrating continued progress toward our 25 percent target. During the quarter we launched the Dometic Recon Series, our premium innovative stackable cooler system, strengthening our Mobile Cooling Solutions portfolio. Together with our Gyro Stabilizer, launched earlier this year in the Marine segment, we continue to deliver innovative solutions across multiple market segments. Both product launches have been very well received in early customer feedback.


We have seen cautious demand in the second quarter influenced by the ongoing global trade conflict. With approximately half of the Group's net sales in the US, we are exposed to tariffs primarily through their impact on consumer sentiment rather than direct tariff costs. Our exposure is limited as 85 percent of our US sales are from products manufactured in the US, or manufactured and sourced in Mexico and Canada with significant protection under the existing North American free trade agreement (USMCA). We have acted quickly by implementing surcharges to offset any negative cost impact and are reviewing our supply chain to minimize the go-forward impact. Considering the geographical spread of our manufacturing footprint, including nine production facilities in the US, we are well positioned from a competitive perspective.


Long-term trends in the Mobile Living industry remain strong. However, it is difficult to predict how the current macroeconomic situation and weak consumer confidence will impact the business in the short term. We are focusing on operational execution and efficiency to be able to adapt to short-term market developments, which will benefit us and further improve our margins when we achieve net sales growth. Under normal circumstances and with current visibility on inventory levels, we would expect to see a gradual recovery in the demand through the Distribution and Service & Aftermarket sales channels. While it remains difficult to predict demand patterns in the coming quarters, we are encouraged by a stabilization in order intake. Going forward the comparables are becoming more favorable, and we expect both new product launches and our restructuring program to continue to contribute positively. 


We will continue to relentlessly drive our strategic agenda. With the restructuring program proceeding as planned, we are placing Dometic in a prime position to deliver on our targets while providing the highest quality of services and products to our customers.”

CEO´s comments
We started the financial year with a high level of activity and continued profitable growth. With clear variations between different parts of the operations, sales grew by 7 percent, of which 1 percent was organic. Exchange rate fluctuations had a negative impact of 4 percent on net sales. EBITA increased by 11 percent to SEK 922 million (831), corresponding to a stronger margin of 15.8 percent (15.3). P/WC rose to 77 percent (71) and we welcomed two new companies with strong positions in attractive niches to the Group. Overall, a good first quarter where our well-diversified operations and attractive business model continue to show strength.

Outlook and guidance

Finnair’s guidance regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result for 2025 has been clarified following the end of industrial action. Guidance excluding any direct impact of industrial action is unchanged. However, Finnair specifies that, based on the current information, the comparable operating result is estimated to be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms.

Under Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025, the company provides additional information on the impacts of industrial action, as well as an estimate of capacity growth, revenue and comparable operating result in 2025, considering the direct impacts of industrial action. 

Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025

Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability and the threat of trade wars cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts are elevated.

Excluding the direct impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. In 2025, profitability is further burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the second quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects.

The estimates above regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include direct impacts of industrial action. In total, the direct negative impact of industrial action in 2025 is estimated to be approximately 100 million euros on revenue, approximately 70 million euros on comparable operating result and approximately 5% on the total capacity, measured by ASKs. In the first half of 2025, industrial action had a direct impact of around -72 million euros on revenue and around -51 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, the three days of industrial action in July and the flights cancelled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following industrial action, including wet lease out flights, are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 25 million euros, other operating income by approximately 5 million euros and comparable operating result by approximately 20 million euros in the third quarter. Based on the cancellations confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a direct negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs.

Considering the direct negative impacts of industrial action, Finnair plans to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c.  5% year-on-year and estimates its revenue to be within the range of 3.2–3.3 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 30–130 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms.

Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the interim report January–September 2025.

Previous outlook and guidance issued on 29 April 2025

Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability, the threat of trade wars and a tense labour market situation in Finland cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts have increased.

Excluding the impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. In 2025, profitability is burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the first quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects.

The estimates regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include impacts of industrial action. In the first quarter of 2025, industrial action had a negative impact of around 31 million euros on revenue and around 22 million euros on the comparable operating result. In April 2025, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of around 15 million euros on revenue and around 10 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, regardless of the duration of industrial action, Finnair has decided to cancel 230 flights scheduled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following the industrial action, which is estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 30 million euros and the comparable operating result by approximately 10 million euros. Based on the cancellations already confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs.

Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the 2025 half-year report.

CEO Turkka Kuusisto: 

The challenges Finnair faced at the beginning of the year continued into the second quarter. We carried over 3 million passengers, and our revenue grew slightly compared to the same period last year. However, our comparable operating result was particularly burdened by industrial action by the Finnish Airline Pilots’ Association in April and by the ground service personnel’s Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) in May and June. I want to extend my heartfelt apologies to each customer whose travel plans were disrupted by the industrial action. 

We reached collective labour agreements with the pilots, cabin crew, and travel agency staff during the quarter. The Service Sector Employers Palta and the IAU also came to an agreement after the period, so we are once again able to operate our flights with the reliability that is expected of us.

The direct negative impact of the prolonged industrial action on second quarter revenue was around 41 million euros, on other operating income around 10 million euros, and on the comparable operating result around 29 million euros.

We had to cancel over 1,300 flights during the quarter due to the industrial action, incurring costs related to customer rerouting and care, as well as compensation for delays. To support our customers’ important travel plans, we allowed them to reschedule flights away from the disruption days without additional fees, which reduced sales on the days to which flights were moved. The uncertainty caused by the disruptions also affected demand for our flights and customer satisfaction. Restoring customer trust and satisfaction is of primary importance to us, and we are systematically working towards this by taking care of our customers and their needs as well as possible, both in the development of our product and services and in our daily operations.

Despite the disruptions caused by industrial action, our operational quality remained high, and we were able to operate 94% of our flights as planned. During the summer season, we operate about 350 flights per day, and even on disruption days, we managed to operate 60–75% of our flights. We have invested in improving the customer experience, particularly in terms of the smoothness of rerouting and customer communication, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of industrial action on our customers during the important summer travel season.

During the quarter, general market uncertainties increased, which began to affect demand for transatlantic flights, and customers’ booking windows became shorter. Our North American traffic grew significantly, but the growth rate was more moderate than previously planned, and average ticket fares in the area declined. In other markets, demand developed as expected. We continued optimising our network and announced new summer 2026 routes to Toronto, Canada, and Alta in Northern Norway. We also added flights to Finnish Lapland for the winter 2025 season.

In June, air travellers chose Finnair as the Best Airline in Northern Europe for the 15th consecutive time, and our cabin crew was also named the best in Northern Europe. This recognition is owed especially to Finnair employees in the front line who work with dedication every day to ensure safe and smooth flights.

Outlook and guidance Finnair’s guidance regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result for 2025 has been clarified following the end of industrial action. Guidance excluding any direct impact of industrial action is unchanged. However, Finnair specifies that, based on the current information, the comparable operating result is estimated to be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Under Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025, the company provides additional information on the impacts of industrial action, as well as an estimate of capacity growth, revenue and comparable operating result in 2025, considering the direct impacts of industrial action. Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability and the threat of trade wars cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts are elevated. Excluding the direct impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. In 2025, profitability is further burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the second quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates above regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include direct impacts of industrial action. In total, the direct negative impact of industrial action in 2025 is estimated to be approximately 100 million euros on revenue, approximately 70 million euros on comparable operating result and approximately 5% on the total capacity, measured by ASKs. In the first half of 2025, industrial action had a direct impact of around -72 million euros on revenue and around -51 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, the three days of industrial action in July and the flights cancelled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following industrial action, including wet lease out flights, are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 25 million euros, other operating income by approximately 5 million euros and comparable operating result by approximately 20 million euros in the third quarter. Based on the cancellations confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a direct negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Considering the direct negative impacts of industrial action, Finnair plans to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 5% year-on-year and estimates its revenue to be within the range of 3.2–3.3 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 30–130 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the interim report January–September 2025. Previous outlook and guidance issued on 29 April 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability, the threat of trade wars and a tense labour market situation in Finland cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts have increased. Excluding the impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. In 2025, profitability is burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the first quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include impacts of industrial action. In the first quarter of 2025, industrial action had a negative impact of around 31 million euros on revenue and around 22 million euros on the comparable operating result. In April 2025, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of around 15 million euros on revenue and around 10 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, regardless of the duration of industrial action, Finnair has decided to cancel 230 flights scheduled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following the industrial action, which is estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 30 million euros and the comparable operating result by approximately 10 million euros. Based on the cancellations already confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the 2025 half-year report. CEO Turkka Kuusisto: The challenges Finnair faced at the beginning of the year continued into the second quarter. We carried over 3 million passengers, and our revenue grew slightly compared to the same period last year. However, our comparable operating result was particularly burdened by industrial action by the Finnish Airline Pilots’ Association in April and by the ground service personnel’s Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) in May and June. I want to extend my heartfelt apologies to each customer whose travel plans were disrupted by the industrial action. We reached collective labour agreements with the pilots, cabin crew, and travel agency staff during the quarter. The Service Sector Employers Palta and the IAU also came to an agreement after the period, so we are once again able to operate our flights with the reliability that is expected of us. The direct negative impact of the prolonged industrial action on second quarter revenue was around 41 million euros, on other operating income around 10 million euros, and on the comparable operating result around 29 million euros. We had to cancel over 1,300 flights during the quarter due to the industrial action, incurring costs related to customer rerouting and care, as well as compensation for delays. To support our customers’ important travel plans, we allowed them to reschedule flights away from the disruption days without additional fees, which reduced sales on the days to which flights were moved. The uncertainty caused by the disruptions also affected demand for our flights and customer satisfaction. Restoring customer trust and satisfaction is of primary importance to us, and we are systematically working towards this by taking care of our customers and their needs as well as possible, both in the development of our product and services and in our daily operations. Despite the disruptions caused by industrial action, our operational quality remained high, and we were able to operate 94% of our flights as planned. During the summer season, we operate about 350 flights per day, and even on disruption days, we managed to operate 60–75% of our flights. We have invested in improving the customer experience, particularly in terms of the smoothness of rerouting and customer communication, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of industrial action on our customers during the important summer travel season. During the quarter, general market uncertainties increased, which began to affect demand for transatlantic flights, and customers’ booking windows became shorter. Our North American traffic grew significantly, but the growth rate was more moderate than previously planned, and average ticket fares in the area declined. In other markets, demand developed as expected. We continued optimising our network and announced new summer 2026 routes to Toronto, Canada, and Alta in Northern Norway. We also added flights to Finnish Lapland for the winter 2025 season. In June, air travellers chose Finnair as the Best Airline in Northern Europe for the 15th consecutive time, and our cabin crew was also named the best in Northern Europe. This recognition is owed especially to Finnair employees in the front line who work with dedication every day to ensure safe and smooth flights.

Update on CARES Phase III clinical programme of anselamimab in light chain amyloidosis

16 July 2025

High-level results from the Cardiac Amyloid Reaching for Extended Survival (CARES) Phase III clinical programme showed that anselamimab, a light chain depleter antibody, did not achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint compared to placebo in patients with Mayo stages IIIa and IIIb light chain (AL) amyloidosis. The primary endpoint was defined as a hierarchical combination of time to all-cause mortality (ACM) and frequency of cardiovascular hospitalisations (CVH). All patients in the clinical programme received background standard of care for plasma cell dyscrasia.

The drug discovery research for lecanemab awarded the 9th Bioindustry Award by the Japan Bioindustry Association

Stockholm, Sweden, July 16, 2025– BioArctic AB’s (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) partner Eisai announced today that the drug discovery research for lecanemab (product name Leqembi®), an antibody indicated for early Alzheimer's disease which was co-developed by Eisai and BioArctic, has received the 9th Bioindustry Award from the Japan Bioindustry Association (JBA).

Professor Lars Lannfelt founded BioArctic together with Pär Gellerfors in 2003 to develop an antibody treatment based on Lannfelt's groundbreaking discoveries of the role of amyloid-beta protein in Alzheimer's disease. These discoveries are the basis for lecanemab, an antibody treatment developed in collaboration with the Japanese company Eisai. By binding to specific forms of amyloid-beta, which causes Alzheimer's disease, lecanemab helps to clear amyloid-beta from the brain, thereby altering the course of the disease.

Eisai serves as the lead of lecanemab development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. BioArctic has the right to commercialize Leqembi in the Nordic region together with Eisai and the two companies are preparing for a joint commercialization in the region.

&ldquo;ABB delivered an all-time-high order intake and improved operational performance. We are on a good path towards a new record year, amidst geopolitical uncertainties.&rdquo;

Morten Wierod, CEO

&nbsp;

CEO summary

I am pleased with what we achieved in the second quarter of 2025, and one of the highlights was the record-high order intake of $9.8 billion, up 16% (14% comparable). It was particularly encouraging to see that the positive development was broad-based across all four business areas, a majority of customer segments, all three geographical regions and in both the short-cycle and project-related businesses. In my view, this signals a robust general trading environment. Order growth was especially strong in the Process Automation business area where a large order of approximately $600 million net was booked. Our book-to-bill was strong at 1.10 and notably it was positive also without the specific large order booking which supported comparable order growth by about 7%.

Sequentially, the trading environment remained largely unchanged, with similar uncertainty linked to potential impacts from trade tariffs.

Broadly in line with our expectations, revenues increased by 8% (6% comparable) year-on-year, supported by three out of four business areas. Revenues in Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation was hampered by weakness in the Machine Automation division where last year&rsquo;s comparable was supported by a stronger order backlog.

Operational EBITA was up by 9% and the margin improvement of 20 basis points to 19.2% was even a bit better than originally expected. Margins increased in both the Electrification and Process Automation business areas, and Motion remained virtually stable. This combined operational improvement offset the year-on-year headwind from margin pressure in Robotics &amp; Discrete Automation linked to the Machine Automation division, as well as the year-on-year headwind of 30 basis points from last year&rsquo;s positive non-repeat in Corporate &amp; other.

We continue to achieve high Return on capital employed and at 23.1% we added to our streak of delivering well above our long-term target. Free cash flow of $845 million was slightly softer than last year as increased earnings were more than offset by the impacts from the growth-related buildup of net working capital and the planned increase in capex spend. Our usual pattern suggests a stronger cash delivery in the second half of the year, and we remain confident in our ambition to improve from last year&rsquo;s annual level.

During the quarter we were recognized by TIME Magazine as one of the top 15 most sustainable companies in the world, across all industries. I view it as a&nbsp;testament to the success of our strategic approach of embedding sustainability into our operations, based on accountability and transparency.

Another highlight in the quarter was the launch of three new robot families, aiming to further strengthen our Robotics business&rsquo; leading position in China. This enables us to support industries and customers to automate with new mid-market value propositions, and it is the result of our full local-for-local value chain. In April, we announced our plans to spin-off our Robotics division as a separately listed company. The carve-out for a distribution as a dividend-in-kind during the second quarter of 2026 is progressing as planned.

Also, I am excited about the Electrification business area launching the next generation of their technology-leading&nbsp; air circuit breaker, the SACE Emax 3. This is the world&rsquo;s first cybersecurity SL2-certified air circuit breaker. As evidence of our strategy of embedded software, the Emax 3 includes sensing, intelligence and advanced algorithms to improve energy security resilience of power systems in critical infrastructure, such as data centers, factories, hospitals and airports.

Outlook

In the third quarter of 2025, we anticipate comparable revenue growth to be at least in the mid-single digit range, and the Operational EBITA margin to remain broadly stable year-on-year; however acknowledging the uncertainty for the global business environment.

In full-year 2025, we expect a positive book-to-bill, comparable revenue growth in the mid-single digit range and the Operational EBITA margin to improve year-on-year, however acknowledging the uncertainty for the global business environment.

Comments by the President and CEO

Strong overall performance
I am proud of the strong operational execution and strong growth momentum in the quarter where we achieved good organic growth of 3% and strong acquired net growth of 5%, despite challenging market conditions. Currency effects posed an important headwind of –8%, resulting in flat total sales growth.

Global Technologies delivered strong organic growth of 8% with positive development in both HID and Global Solutions. Americas achieved good growth of 4% with high single digit sales growth in the North America Non-Residential segment and stable development in the North America Residential and Latin America segments. We see strong growth in the aftermarket, fueled by robust demand for electromechanical upgrades. Entrance Systems had a small organic growth of 1% with growth across all segments except Industrial. Sales declined organically by 1% in EMEIA primarily due to some delays in project businesses and a continued weak residential market, and Asia Pacific’s organic sales declined by 1% as the residential markets remain weak here as well, particularly in China.

The operating profit excluding items affecting comparability increased by 1% to SEK 6,155 M despite significant negative currency effects, with a corresponding operating margin of 16.2% (16.0). Although effects from acquisitions net and currency diluted the operating margin by 70bps, this was more than offset by an excellent operating leverage of 53%, supported by price/cost tailwind and savings from our Manufacturing Footprint Programs and continuous efficiency improvements. The operating cash flow remained strong and totaled SEK 5,452 M, corresponding to a strong cash conversion of 103%.

Our agile decentralized organization enables us to invest in opportunities while increasing cost efficiency
Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, including the tariff situation in the US and mixed market conditions globally, our decentralized structure and agile approach continues to be a great advantage. In this uneven landscape, our local teams are empowered to respond quickly to the specific dynamics of their respective market. By reallocating resources and shifting focus, we can capture growth opportunities while maintaining cost efficiency. For example, even in a softer market environment, we are seeing strong demand for upgrades to electromechanical and digital solutions. Sales in the quarter of electromechanical products and solutions grew 12%, adjusted for currencies. To capitalize on this opportunity and maintain our competitive edge, we are strategically investing in innovation and strengthening our sales organization. At the same time, we are reducing spending in other areas of the business.

We also continue to invest in growth through acquisitions, completing five acquisitions in the quarter. One of these was TeleAlarm, a European provider of integrated remote care technology for independent living. The acquisition strengthens our position in Senior Care, where demand for smart and connected solutions is growing, and supports our broader ambition of increasing our presence in key verticals.

Comments by the CEO

The financial performance in the second quarter was mixed across our two regions. Yet again, our Region North America delivered outstanding results across all financial KPIs. However, outcome in Region Europe was challenging, fighting soft market conditions in most categories. 

Currency-neutral net sales in Region North America grew by 5% versus the same period last year, and the production capacity utilization rate in our US mills continued to improve. We have reached a solid operating rate of 76%. Our mills in upper Michigan are well placed with proximity to a large customer base and continue to excel by being the local partner which can offer quality, speed, reliability and predictability. Our North American region delivered another outstanding quarter with an EBITDA margin of 22%, our best result since Q4 2022. Profitability was mainly strengthened by continued volume growth and price increase on coated freesheet paper reels, which represent 60% of our graphic paper sales.  

Uncertainty continued to impact market conditions for our Region Europe in the second quarter. The currency-neutral net sales declined by 3% versus last year. The geopolitical and macroeconomic situation have caused consumers to hold back on spending. Also, the new reality around import tariffs have started to impact trade flows, causing an escalation of the already oversupplied fiber-based packaging materials market in Europe. For our largest product category, liquid packaging board, we continued to meet fierce competition and weak demand in Asia. The second quarter is the heaviest maintenance period for Region Europe and impacted earnings by around SEK 380 million. The region’s quarterly EBITDA margin was 5% (excluding maintenance impact: 11%). 

In this challenging operating environment, our philosophy is simple: We continue to relentlessly focus on items we can control. As we had expected, the efforts to reduce working capital are paying off. Swiftly adjusting our production schedule to market reality and manage inventories carefully. Our cash conversion in the second quarter was excellent, coming in at 131%. Cash generation is one of our top company priorities, and I am encouraged to see a more than doubled operating cash delivery in the first half of 2025 versus a year ago. In the second quarter we also maintained fixed cost discipline, and so far in 2025 we have managed to offset a significant part of inflation through efficiencies.    

The progress of program Evolution in North America, shifting our product portfolio towards packaging materials, is exceeding our expectations. Although it is still early days, we are experiencing strong customer support and we have numerous trials for both our bleached liner Tribute® and low-grammage cartonboard Voyager®. Being a local, reliable partner that can offer US-made products with speed has accelerated customer interest. We are well on track to exceed our initial target of commercializing 15 ktons US paperboard for 2025. Our upgrade of the Escanaba mill, to enable even further acceleration towards paperboard production, is progressing as per plan.

For the third quarter we expect stable market conditions for North America. For Region Europe, uncertainty remains high in the wake of the geopolitical turmoil. We do not foresee a fast recovery in Europe in the coming quarter, based on the current weak trading environment. After a long period of increasing wood prices in the Nordics, we have seen the first price reductions in the market. The impact for the third quarter is limited, but it is a clear trend shift in terms of inflation for our biggest input cost component. 

Billerud is a leader in high performance packaging materials, with a strong financial position and low investment needs. We are well positioned in terms of product categories and geographies to evolve our business and to further strengthen our financial performance. Our focus remains on a few and selective priorities that all are in our control. By delivering on our Way Forward strategy, we will make Billerud stronger and more resilient to navigate future challenges and successfully capture opportunities to win versus competition. 


Ivar Vatne 
President and CEO


Second quarter

Sales and results

Net sales for the second quarter declined by 5% to SEK 10,244 million (10,764), negatively impacted by currency changes. The currency-neutral net sales development compared with the same period last year was almost unchanged, positively affected by higher sales prices and negatively affected by lower sales volumes. Sales volumes totaled 863 ktons (895). Production was curtailed as an adjustment to the demand in both regions. 

Adjusted EBITDA amounted to SEK 912 million (1,003), corresponding to a margin of 9% (9). Price increases and lower costs for maintenance shutdowns did not compensate for higher input costs, primarily related to pulpwood in the Nordics, lower volumes and a negative change in inventory revaluation. Compared to the second quarter last year, the results in Region North America and in the business segment Other improved, while the result in Region Europe deteriorated. 

Annual maintenance shutdowns were carried out in Gruvön, Skärblacka and Rockhammar in the second quarter of 2025 with a total cost impact of around SEK 380 million. During the second quarter of 2024, the cost impact of maintenance shutdowns at the mills Gruvön, Skärblacka, Pietarsaari and Quinnesec was SEK 515 million.  

The net result from emission rights had a positive impact of SEK 120 million in the second quarter of 2025 (114). Billerud is not expected to receive any emission rights from 2026 and onwards. 

No items classified as affecting comparability impacted the result in the second quarter (-119). The items affecting comparability in the second quarter of 2024 were related to costs for the US transformation program of SEK 189 million, and a positive result of SEK 70 million from the sale of Wisconsin Water Quality Center (WQC) assets.     
 

Market development and outlook 

In the second quarter of 2025, the market conditions for Billerud’s sack and kraft papers and liquid packaging board in Europe were at normalized levels. The demand for liquid packaging board in Asia, however, remained weak. The market conditions for cartonboard and containerboard in Europe weakened during the second quarter, with subdued demand due to tariff uncertainties in combination with oversupply. The market sentiment for graphic and specialty paper in North America was solid. Billerud partially implemented price increases within graphic paper, sack and kraft paper, and containerboard during the second quarter. 

For the third quarter, Billerud expects weak market conditions for most materials produced in Region Europe, given a continued soft packaging demand due to geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. Market conditions for Billerud’s graphic and specialty paper in North America are expected to continue to be solid, but prices for market pulp will decrease. Billerud expects to have seasonally lower fixed costs in the third quarter, but with continued high maintenance cost impact. Input costs are expected to remain stable. 
 

Events in the quarter 

On 1 May 2025, Jaakko Nikkilä assumed the role of President of Billerud Europe. Jaakko Nikkilä has extensive experience in international sales and production of fiber-based packaging materials and recently served as Executive Vice President in UPM. 

Billerud’s 2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM) elected Gunilla Saltin as a new board member and re-elected Jan Svensson, Victoria Van Camp, Florian Heiserer, Magnus Nicolin, Andreas Blaschke and Regi Aalstad as board members. Jan Svensson was elected board chairman. The AGM further resolved in accordance with the board’s dividend proposal. Meeting minutes can be found on Billerud’s webpage.  

On 13 June, the Norwegian Environmental Agency announced that they are maintaining their rejection of the environmental permit for Billerud Viken AS to produce BCTMP in Follum, Norway
 

Events after the quarter

Ulrika Wedberg, Executive Vice President Sustainability & Public Affairs, will leave Billerud on 30 September. She will be succeeded by Sofia Hedevåg, who will assume this role on 1 December 2025 and who presently holds the position as Senior Vice President Sustainability and member of the Group Management in Gränges.

Adjusted EBITDA amounted to SEK 912 million (1,003), corresponding to a margin of 9% (9). Price increases and lower costs for maintenance shutdowns did not compensate for higher input costs, primarily related to pulpwood in the Nordics, lower volumes and a negative change in inventory revaluation. Compared to the second quarter last year, the results in Region North America and in the business segment Other improved, while the result in Region Europe deteriorated. Annual maintenance shutdowns were carried out in Gruvön, Skärblacka and Rockhammar in the second quarter of 2025 with a total cost impact of around SEK 380 million. During the second quarter of 2024, the cost impact of maintenance shutdowns at the mills Gruvön, Skärblacka, Pietarsaari and Quinnesec was SEK 515 million. The net result from emission rights had a positive impact of SEK 120 million in the second quarter of 2025 (114). Billerud is not expected to receive any emission rights from 2026 and onwards. No items classified as affecting comparability impacted the result in the second quarter (-119). The items affecting comparability in the second quarter of 2024 were related to costs for the US transformation program of SEK 189 million, and a positive result of SEK 70 million from the sale of Wisconsin Water Quality Center (WQC) assets. Market development and outlook In the second quarter of 2025, the market conditions for Billerud’s sack and kraft papers and liquid packaging board in Europe were at normalized levels. The demand for liquid packaging board in Asia, however, remained weak. The market conditions for cartonboard and containerboard in Europe weakened during the second quarter, with subdued demand due to tariff uncertainties in combination with oversupply. The market sentiment for graphic and specialty paper in North America was solid. Billerud partially implemented price increases within graphic paper, sack and kraft paper, and containerboard during the second quarter. For the third quarter, Billerud expects weak market conditions for most materials produced in Region Europe, given a continued soft packaging demand due to geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. Market conditions for Billerud’s graphic and specialty paper in North America are expected to continue to be solid, but prices for market pulp will decrease. Billerud expects to have seasonally lower fixed costs in the third quarter, but with continued high maintenance cost impact. Input costs are expected to remain stable. Events in the quarter On 1 May 2025, Jaakko Nikkilä assumed the role of President of Billerud Europe. Jaakko Nikkilä has extensive experience in international sales and production of fiber-based packaging materials and recently served as Executive Vice President in UPM. Billerud’s 2025 Annual General Meeting (AGM) elected Gunilla Saltin as a new board member and re-elected Jan Svensson, Victoria Van Camp, Florian Heiserer, Magnus Nicolin, Andreas Blaschke and Regi Aalstad as board members. Jan Svensson was elected board chairman. The AGM further resolved in accordance with the board’s dividend proposal. Meeting minutes can be found on Billerud’s webpage. On 13 June, the Norwegian Environmental Agency announced that they are maintaining their rejection of the environmental permit for Billerud Viken AS to produce BCTMP in Follum, Norway Events after the quarter Ulrika Wedberg, Executive Vice President Sustainability & Public Affairs, will leave Billerud on 30 September. She will be succeeded by Sofia Hedevåg, who will assume this role on 1 December 2025 and who presently holds the position as Senior Vice President Sustainability and member of the Group Management in Gränges. * For key figures and a reconciliation of alternative performance measures including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted ROCE and interest-bearing net debt/adjusted EBITDA, see pages 14-16.

Electrolux Group Interim report Q2 2025

Highlights of the second quarter of 2025

 * Net sales amounted to SEK 31,276m (33,819) with an organic sales growth of 1.8% (6.8), driven by growth in North America and Latin America, partly offset by a slight decline in Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle-East and Africa. 
 * Operating income improved to SEK 797m (419) corresponding to an operating margin of 2.5% (1.2), driven mainly by an improvement in North America that reported a positive operating income in the quarter. Group operating income included a positive effect from the divestment of the Kelvinator trademark portfolio in India of SEK 180m.  
 * Income for the period amounted to SEK 178m (-80) and earnings per share were SEK 0.66 (-0.30). 
 * Operating cash flow after investments was SEK -741m (1,226), negatively impacted by an increase in working capital and the payment of the previously communicated French antitrust fine. 
President and CEO Yannick Fierling’s comment

Market outperformance in North America, amid uncertain market conditions

Organic sales growth was slightly positive in the quarter at 1.8%, driven by North America and Latin America. Business area Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa reported a slight organic sales decline, with a negative price development. In Europe, our main brands continued to outperform the market, whereas the general market demand declined somewhat with increased competitive pressure, and replacement driven demand. In North America, market demand declined slightly in the quarter, and we continued to outperform the market. In both Europe and North America, consumers continue to shift to lower price points and demand was impacted by uncertainty due to ongoing geopolitical developments. In Latin America, consumer demand increased slightly. As anticipated, in Brazil, growth was hampered by inflationary pressure and increased interest rates. Business area Latin America reported slight organic sales growth. 

Improved operating earnings with positive contribution from North America 

Operating margin improved, with a positive contribution from North America where list price increases offset increased costs related to U.S. tariffs introduced in the quarter. The competitive pressure and promotional activity were high in the quarter. Latin America continued to deliver an operating margin above our Group mid-term target of 6%. In Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the underlying operating income was lower mainly due to a negative price development. Operating cash flow was negative, impacted by a seasonal increase in working capital, a negative impact related to U.S. tariffs and a payment of the earlier announced French antitrust fine. 

Our market and business outlook for the year remains unchanged, and we reiterate our aim to offset tariff-related cost increases in North America through price increases.

Looking ahead, consumer centricity and transformation in focus

In the quarter, we executed well on our long-term strategic priorities. We continued our journey to strengthen our brands, with new marketing campaigns to support recently launched innovations. In the U.S. we are currently launching new Frigidaire ovens with stone-baked pizza mode. North America has been a focus point for improvements, and in the quarter, the business area reported a positive operating income. We continued to make good progress on cost-efficiency measures, delivering cost savings from procurement as well as product engineering. Maintaining a consumer-centric approach, as well as increasing speed and agility, are key components of our strategy. In the coming quarter, we will increase our focus on the major transformation areas and to drive speed and agility.

The second quarter results demonstrate our commitment to deliver on our strategic priorities amid challenging market conditions.

 * Revenues decreased -8% to MSEK 15 130 (16 511), with currency impacting negatively with -9%. The organic increase was 1%. 
 * Operating profit amounted to MSEK 2 831 (2 921), including items affecting comparability of MSEK -153 (-325)*, mainly relating to efficiency measures. The operating margin was 18.7% (17.7).

 * Operating cash flow amounted to MSEK 1 104 (1 609). 
 * Net debt/EBITDA ratio was 0.82 (1.04). 
 * Epiroc won a significant contract, MAUD 350 (SEK 2.2 billion) over five years, to deliver a fleet of fully autonomous and electric surface mining equipment to Fortescue in Australia. The first portion of the contract, valued at approximately MSEK 100, was booked as orders received in the quarter. 
CEO comments

High mining demand
Orders received in the second quarter increased 2% organically and amounted to MSEK 15 276 (16 349). Currency impacted with -9%. The customer activity within mining was high and large mining equipment orders, which are lumpy in nature, amounted to MSEK 500 (950). These include MSEK 100 from Fortescue in Australia, which in April awarded Epiroc our largest contract ever, SEK 2.2 billion over five years. We will deliver a fleet of fully autonomous and electric surface mining equipment to Fortescue. Mining customers’ willingness to invest has increased lately, also within exploration, and we continue to see a growing interest for our automation and electrification solutions. The demand for attachments from the construction industry, however, remained weak.

Sequentially, compared to the previous quarter, Group orders increased 1% organically.

In the near term, we expect mining demand to remain at a high level, while demand from construction customers is expected to remain weak.

Revenues and profitability
Our revenues amounted to MSEK 15 130 (16 511), corresponding to 1% organic growth. The currency effect was negative at -9%. The operating profit, EBIT, was MSEK 2 831 (2 921), corresponding to a margin of 18.7% (17.7). The operating result includes items affecting comparability of MSEK -153, of which the change in provision for the share-based long-term incentive programs was MSEK -6 (-18). The other MSEK -147 are relating to efficiency measures, such as the MSEK -70 for the closure of the tools manufacturing site in Langley, Canada. Adjusted, the operating margin, EBIT, was unchanged at 19.7% (19.7), supported mainly by increased efficiency within Tools & Attachments.

Profitable growth
We remain focused on delivering profitable growth and are continuously taking actions, such as consolidating sites and discontinuing non-strategic product lines. Also, given the current uncertainties around tariffs, we are emphasizing agility and global reach by optimizing logistics and distribution, leveraging global manufacturing, exploring alternative suppliers, and implementing mitigating actions together with customers and suppliers.

Cash flow
Our operating cash flow was MSEK 1 104 (1 609), negatively impacted by lower operating profit and more working capital tied up. The cash conversion rate, rolling 12 months, was 94% (90).

Innovation that drives value
With a background in R&D, I feel especially proud to represent Epiroc when we bring leading solutions to the market. In the quarter, we launched several innovations, including an automated rod magazine for the Diamec exploration rig, keeping the operator away from danger while boosting productivity. Another example that makes a real positive difference is the electrified ramp haulage solution in Boliden’s Kristineberg mine in Sweden, the result of our collaboration with Boliden and ABB. Compared to a diesel-driven equivalent, the trolley solution has increased productivity by 23%. The truck speed up ramp is 50% higher, the maintenance cost is reduced by 25% and the energy regeneration to the battery when the truck goes downhill and/or is connected to the pantograph is unlimited.

Stability and long-term delivery
In an ever-changing and volatile world, with an increasing level of uncertainty, our commitment to stability and long-term delivery towards customers and investors remains firm. Our goal is to create financial outperformance by being active in attractive niches where we offer our customers the most innovative and productive solutions. We will safeguard our customers' operations through precision in our service and aftermarket offering, and consistently strive to deliver excellence in everything we do. We will adapt quicker, innovate more and always try to find a better way to do things.

CEO’s comment

Market conditions

The mixed market conditions continued during the quarter, and the advantages of our broad exposure were clear. Activity levels remained high in the Oil and Gas and Nuclear segments in the Tube division and in the Medical segment in the Kanthal division. Demand in the Strip division leveled off somewhat compared with the preceding quarter, but is still at a favourable level.

The market conditions in other customer segments were generally hesitant, driven by higher uncertainty resulting from trade policy turbulence. This was particularly noticeable in the project-related parts of our business, with customers being cautious about making major investment decisions. In the Tube division, demand was generally lower in the Chemical and Petrochemical and Industrial segments, with the largest decline in Europe. Demand in the Industrial Heating segment in Kanthal remained at a low level.

Order intake for the rolling 12-month period amounted to SEK 18,911 million (20,135) and organic growth was -2%.

Resilient underlying profitability

Revenues declined organically by 4% during the quarter to SEK 4,765 million (5,359). These lower revenues were mainly related to the short-cycle and low-refined business, in the Industrial segment and the Chemical and Petrochemical segment in the Tube division. Lower revenues for the Industrial Heating segment in Kanthal also added to this development.

Adjusted EBIT amounted to SEK 454 million (592), corresponding to a margin of 9.5% (11.1), and included currency headwinds of SEK -115 million compared with the year-earlier period. The EBIT margin excluding currency effects amounted to 11.4%, thereby demonstrating resilience despite lower revenues.

Free operating cash flow amounted to SEK 347 million (486), impacted by lower operating profit and higher growth investments.

Negligible direct impact from tariffs and trade barriers

We have local production in our largest regions for most of our businesses, including the US. We were successful at passing on the cost of tariffs to our customers, which meant that we did not note any significant negative direct impact from import tariffs to the US. However, we did see a greater impact on the global economy and demand resulting from delayed investment decisions among some customers, as described above.

Planned maintenance stoppage during the summer

We usually carry out planned maintenance stoppages in our production in the third quarter. This summer, we will replace our expansion press and the stoppage will therefore be longer than normal at one of the largest production sites in Sandviken. The new press has a higher degree of automation and will, among other things, increase productivity and improve safety for the operators. 

Continued investments and adjustments

Moving forward, we need to remain agile in order to maintain a solid level of profitability in a turbulent market. We are making the necessary adjustments, while being mindful of the long-term growth opportunities we see in our customer segments. 

Ongoing growth investments in segments including Medical, Industrial Heating, Nuclear and Chemical and Petrochemical are proceeding according to plan. We are also still seeing a growing global need for energy, energy efficiency and countries’ pursuit of a stable and reliable energy supply. Accordingly, our long-term view of the performance of our high value-added niche in the oil and gas market remains positive. We also have a positive view of the development in key segments like Nuclear and Medical.

Free operating cash flow amounted to SEK 347 million (486), impacted by lower operating profit and higher growth investments. Negligible direct impact from tariffs and trade barriers We have local production in our largest regions for most of our businesses, including the US. We were successful at passing on the cost of tariffs to our customers, which meant that we did not note any significant negative direct impact from import tariffs to the US. However, we did see a greater impact on the global economy and demand resulting from delayed investment decisions among some customers, as described above. Planned maintenance stoppage during the summer We usually carry out planned maintenance stoppages in our production in the third quarter. This summer, we will replace our expansion press and the stoppage will therefore be longer than normal at one of the largest production sites in Sandviken. The new press has a higher degree of automation and will, among other things, increase productivity and improve safety for the operators. Continued investments and adjustments Moving forward, we need to remain agile in order to maintain a solid level of profitability in a turbulent market. We are making the necessary adjustments, while being mindful of the long-term growth opportunities we see in our customer segments. Ongoing growth investments in segments including Medical, Industrial Heating, Nuclear and Chemical and Petrochemical are proceeding according to plan. We are also still seeing a growing global need for energy, energy efficiency and countries’ pursuit of a stable and reliable energy supply. Accordingly, our long-term view of the performance of our high value-added niche in the oil and gas market remains positive. We also have a positive view of the development in key segments like Nuclear and Medical.

3.4% organic sales growth*
9.1% operating margin
9.3% adjusted operating margin*

Full year 2025 guidance
Around 3% organic sales growth
Around 0% FX effect on net sales
Around 10-10.5% adjusted operating margin
Around $1.2 billion operating cash flow

All change figures in this release compare to the same period of the previous year except when stated otherwise.



Key business developments in the second quarter of 2025

 * Net sales increased organically* by 3.4%, which was 0.7pp higher than the global LVP increase of 2.7% (S&P Global July 2025). Regional and customer LVP mix is estimated to have had about 2.5pp negative impact on sales, while tariff compensations added around 1pp to growth. We outperformed in Americas, Europe and Asia excl. China, mainly due to product launches and tariff compensations. In China, our growth gap vs. LVP was smaller compared to recent quarters, due to improved sales performance with Chinese OEMs. We expect that our record number of new launches will significantly improve our relative sales performance in China in the second half of 2025. 
 * Profitability improved significantly, mainly due to organic sales growth and successful execution of cost reductions. Total headcount decreased by 5%. We estimate that the negative impact from U.S. tariffs was around 35bps on operating margin, as we managed to pass on most of the tariff costs to our customers. Operating income increased by 20% to $247 million and adjusted operating income* increased by 14% to $251 million. Operating margin was 9.1% and adjusted operating margin* was 9.3%. ROCE was 23.8% and adjusted ROCE* was 24.1%. 
 * Operating cash flow was lower than last year, as Q2 2024 was boosted by positive, timing related working capital effects, while working capital changes in 2025 were more normal. This was partly offset by lower capex, net. The leverage ratio* of 1.3x is well below our target limit of 1.5x. In the quarter, a dividend of $0.70 per share was paid and 0.5 million shares were repurchased and retired. 
*For non-U.S. GAAP measures see enclosed reconciliation tables.

Comments from Mikael Bratt, President & CEO

I am pleased to, in a turbulent market environment, report a record breaking second quarter for sales, operating income and margin as well as EPS. The performance was driven by good sales development coupled with successful actions to reduce costs and achieve tariff compensations. We outperformed in Americas, Europe and Asia excl. China and continued to outperform global LVP despite strong headwinds from LVP mix shifts, particularly in China. Based on a positive trend during the second quarter and a record number of new launches we continue to expect significantly improved sales vs. LVP in China in the second half year.

We remain focused on operational efficiency, commercial excellence and our cost reduction programs. Direct headcount was reduced by 6% while sales grew 3% organically, which together with continued repurchases of shares, contributed to a 27% increase in EPS. We remain confident that we can continue to successfully receive compensation from our customers for tariffs, although the industry outlook for tariffs is uncertain. We recovered around 80% of tariff costs in the second quarter, and we expect to recover most of what remains later in the year. We continue to closely monitor and evaluate the situation, focusing on being adaptive and agile.

At our Capital Markets Day in June, we reiterated our financial targets and communicated a new share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion until the end of 2029 as well as announced a 21% dividend increase for the third quarter to $0.85 per share. Our increased shareholder return ambitions are supported by our strong balance sheet and cash conversion.

Our 2025 guidance for organic sales growth has increased to around 3% due to tariff compensations, and we reiterate our guidance of an adjusted operating margin of around 10-10.5%.

Tagrisso plus chemotherapy demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival in EGFR-mutated advanced lung cancer

21 July 2025

Positive high-level results from the final overall survival (OS) analysis of the FLAURA2 Phase III trial showed AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso (osimertinib) with the addition of pemetrexed and platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the key secondary endpoint of OS compared to Tagrisso monotherapy for patients with 1st-line locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated (EGFRm) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).​

2025-07-21,Corem Property Group,Decisions at the Extra General Meeting of Corem Property Group AB (publ),"[*] 
Decisions at the Extra General Meeting of Corem Property Group AB (publ)

At the Extra General Meeting of Corem Property Group AB (publ) (”Corem” or the ”Company”) on 21 July 2025 (the “EGM”), the following decisions were made.

For more detailed information on the content of the resolutions, please refer to the notice convening the EGM and the Board of Directors’ complete proposals to resolutions. The notice convening the EGM and the Board of Directors’ complete proposals to resolutions are available on the Company's website, www.corem.se.

The EGM decided to approve the Board of Directors’ resolution on a new share issue of ordinary shares of Class B with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal.

As communicated on 10 June 2025, the Board of Directors of Corem resolved on 10 June 2025 on a directed share issue of in total 192,000,000 ordinary shares of Class B. According to the resolution by the Board of Directors, the directed issue shall be carried out through two separate resolutions on share issues, partly as a directed issue of 110,032,787 ordinary shares of Class B, pursuant to the authorisation to issue shares granted by the Annual General Meeting held on 23 April 2025, through an accelerated book-building procedure targeting Swedish and international institutional and other professional investors (“Tranche 1”), and partly as a directed issue of 81,967,213 ordinary shares of Class B, subject to the subsequent approval of an extraordinary general meeting of the Company, directed to the Company's largest shareholder M2 Asset Management AB (publ) (“Tranche 2”).

The issue resolution in Tranche 2 has today been approved by the EGM of Corem. The subscription price in both directed issues was based upon the accelerated book-building procedure carried out by Nordea Bank Abp, filial i Sverige. The subscription price in the share issue in Tranche 1 was SEK 4.9 per ordinary share of Class B. By virtue of the dividend with record date on 30 June 2025, and which has accrued to the participants in Tranche 1, the subscription price per ordinary share of Class B in the share issue in Tranche 2 has been adjusted downwards by an amount corresponding to the dividend amount per ordinary share of Class B, that is, 0.02 SEK per ordinary share of Class B. Since the subscription price has been determined through an accelerated book-building procedure and, as far as Tranche 2 is concerned, has been adjusted by a deduction of the dividend amount attributable to each ordinary share of Class B on the record date of 30 June 2025 as resolved by the Annual General Meeting on 23 April 2025, the Board of Directors has assessed that the subscription price reflects current market conditions and demand and is therefore on market terms.

The share issue in Tranche 2 approved by the EGM entails an increase of the Company's share capital by a maximum of SEK 163,934,426 through a new share issue of a maximum of 81,967,213 ordinary shares of Class B.

The Company’s Board of Directors has made an overall assessment and carefully considered the possibility of raising capital through a new share issue with preferential rights for the Company’s shareholders. The Board of Directors has considered that the reasons for deviating from the shareholders’ preferential rights are (i) that a rights issue would take a significantly longer time to complete and entail a higher risk for an adverse effect on the share price, particularly in light of the current market volatility and the challenging market conditions, (ii) that the participation in the new share issue by the Company’s largest shareholder has had a positive impact on the possibility of simultaneously carrying out the new share issue of 110,032,787 ordinary shares of Class B directed to Swedish and International institutional and other professional investors, and (iii) to carry out a directed issue can be made at lower costs and with less complexity than a rights issue. Furthermore, the reason for including the existing shareholder M2 Asset Management AB (publ) as entitled to subscribe is that the shareholder in question has expressed and shown interest in long-term ownership in the Company, which the Board of Directors has considered creates security, stability and favorable conditions for the Company’s growth and has thus been deemed to be beneficial to both the Company and all shareholders.

Considering the above, the Board of Directors has made the assessment that a directed issue of ordinary shares of Class B with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is the most favorable alternative for the Company to carry out the capital raise and is in the best interests of all shareholders. The Board of Directors has therefore considered that the reasons for the directed issue outweigh the main rule that new issues should be carried out with preferential rights for the shareholders.

The EGM also decided to amend the Company’s Articles of Association in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal, adjusting the limits on the Company's share capital and number of shares.

The EGM decided, in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal, to authorise the Board of Directors to, on one or more occasions, during the period until the next Annual General Meeting, decide on issues of new ordinary shares of Class A, and/or Class B, and/or Class D, and/or preference shares, with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights. The number of shares issued pursuant to the authorisation may correspond to an increase in the share capital of no more than ten (10) per cent, based on the total share capital of the Company at the time of the EGM on 21 July 2025.

The EGM also decided to confirm the 2025 Annual General Meeting's resolution on the allocation of the Company’s profits in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal.

Martijn Bergink appointed President of the Marine Division of Alfa Laval

Alfa Laval today announces that Martijn Bergink has been appointed President of the Marine Division, effective 1 September 2025. This is in addition to his current roles as President of Business Unit Pumping Systems in the Marine Division and Managing Director of Framo, an Alfa Laval-owned company. 

Martijn Bergink joined Alfa Laval in 1998 and, since then, he has held multiple senior leadership positions within the company, mostly in the Marine Division. In his new role as president of the Marine Division he will join Group Management. Martijn will continue as the Managing Director of Framo and President of BU Pumping Systems.  

“Martijn has had a long and successful career in Alfa Laval and has a deep knowledge and understanding of the dynamics and developments in the marine industry”, says Tom Erixon, CEO and President, Alfa Laval.  

In 2024 the Marine Division of Alfa Laval accounted for 40 percent of the order intake. The division employs 6,300 of the group’s 22,300 people. The division delivers a wide range of products, systems and solutions for the marine industry, focusing on enhancing energy efficiency, decarbonization, digitalization, and compliance with environmental regulations.   

“I am honoured and excited by the opportunity to lead the Marine Division. I look forward to further developing the business to meet future customer needs as we continue the decarbonization journey and seize the opportunities ahead of us. I'm also looking forward to joining Group Management to help shape the future for Alfa Laval,” says Martijn Bergink. 

The current President of the Marine Division, EVP Sameer Kalra, will be retiring after a long, and successful tenure at Alfa Laval. Sameer joined Alfa Laval when the company acquired Aalborg Industries in 2011 and has been instrumental in the continued growth and success of the Marine Division, and in the work to develop products and technologies to support the decarbonization of the merchant fleet.  

“It has been a big privilege to lead the transformation of the Marine Division through the ongoing energy transition,” says Sameer Kalra. “I have truly enjoyed being a part of the team on this journey. Now I am looking forward to more family time from my home base in Singapore.”   

Tom Erixon, CEO and President, Alfa Laval, says: “Sameer Kalra is leaving the Marine Division and the Marine team in very good shape to continue its journey. He has shaped the business, the portfolio and our culture more than most.”

Electrolux Professional AB interim report Q2 2025

Second quarter, April-June 2025

 * Net sales amounted to SEK 3,195m (3,268), a decrease of 2.2%. Organically, sales increased by 2.4%. The acquisition of Adventys in 2024 contributed with 0.2%. Currency translation had a negative impact of 4.8%. 
 * EBITA amounted to SEK 392m (410), corresponding to a margin of 12.3% (12.5). 
 * Operating income amounted to SEK 340m (353), corresponding to a margin of 10.6% (10.8). 
 * Income for the period amounted to SEK 217m (230), and earnings per share was SEK 0.75 (0.80). 
 * Operating cash flow after investments amounted to SEK 305m (392). 
Alberto Zanata, President, and CEO:

“Food & Beverage back to organic growth, US continues to be strong

The second quarter of 2025 showed organic growth in both segments. Sales are developing well, but the impact from currency had at negative effect on profit compared to last year.

The global macroeconomic situation continues to be uncertain, but demand has so far been good with continued positive sales development in the US, and the Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa region finally returning to growth.

Good growth in Food & Beverage
Sales of Food & Beverage increased by 3.3% organically, driven by strong growth in the Americas, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, while sales in Europe declined slightly. EBITA margin declined somewhat compared to last year, due to higher operational costs, but also due to weak sales in Beverage. US tariffs had no material impact. Order intake for Food & Beverage was significantly higher than last year in all regions.

Improved margin in Laundry
Organically, sales of Laundry increased by 1.0%. Sales in the US were down at the beginning of the quarter due to uncertainty about tariffs but improved towards the end of the quarter. EBITA margin improved somewhat, despite a significant negative impact from currency equivalent to 2.5% in margin. US tariffs had no material impact. Order intake was somewhat higher than a year ago.

Improved sustainability rating
I am proud to report that EcoVadis, a provider of business sustainability ratings, has awarded us the prestigious Gold Medal, placing us in the top 5% of companies globally in terms of sustainable business practices. In addition, we have established a framework for green financing to further integrate the company’s climate change mitigation ambition into our financing set-up.

Focus on cost efficiency
Sales and order intake developed well during the quarter, but profitability did not improve due to the currency impact and higher operational costs. We will maintain a higher pace in R&D during 2025 and 2026, due to large investments in both Laundry and Cooking.

During the quarter, we have had a limited impact from the current tariffs and, if these levels remain, we should be able to mitigate the impact for the rest of the year.

So far, given the macroeconomic uncertainty, we have not been able to offset the currency impact. However, this is our aim medium term. In parallel, we will increase our focus on general cost efficiency to make our company leaner, more agile and productive. The combination of innovation and cost efficiency will support our ability to future-proof the Group. These actions make me confident that we should be able to improve our performance going forward.""

Proposed resolutions

Election of chairman of the Extraordinary General Meeting (item 2)

The Board of Directors proposes that Jesper Schönbeck, member of the Swedish Bar Association, from Advokatfirman Vinge, is elected as chairman of the Extraordinary General Meeting.

Proposal to amend the articles of association (item 7)

The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based investment share program, as suggested in item 8 below. To enable the issuance, reclassification, and redemption of class C shares, the Board of Directors proposes to amend the articles of association as follows:

An updated wording of section 5 is proposed in the articles of association. 

Current wording	Proposed wording	

 5 Numbers of shares 

The number of shares shall be not less than 300,000,000 shares and not more than 1,200,000,000 shares.
	
 5 Numbers of shares

The number of shares shall be not less than 300,000,000 shares and not more than 1,200,000,000 shares.

The shares shall be issued in two classes, ordinary shares and class C shares. Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share, whereas class C shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company.

Holders of class C shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company’s liquidation, class C shares carry equivalent right to the company’s assets as other shares, however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. 

Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue, one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights). Unless shares offered in such manner are sufficient for the subscription which takes place pursuant to subsidiary pre-emption rights, the shares shall be allotted among the subscribers’ pro rata to the total number of shares previously owned. Where this is not possible with respect to a particular share(s), shares shall be allotted through drawing of lots.

The provisions above shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility for the company to adopt a resolution regarding a cash issue or set-off issue without regard to shareholders’ pre-emption rights.

The provisions above regarding shareholders’ pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis to an issue of warrants or an issue of convertible instruments.

Where the company resolves to issue only one class of shares by way of a cash issue or set-off issue, all shareholders, irrespective of the class of share, shall hold pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares pro rata to the number of shares previously owned.

In the event of a bonus issue, new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith, the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue, following the required amendment to the articles of association.

Reduction of share capital, which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital, may, upon the request of an owner of class C shares and a resolution by the company’s board of directors or the general meeting, take place through redemption of class C shares. A request from a shareholder shall be made in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed, an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company’s reserve fund, if required funds are available. The redemption amount per C- share shall correspond to the quota value of such share.

Following notice of the redemption resolution, holders of shares shall promptly receive payment for the shares, or, if authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court is required, following notice that the final decision has been registered. 

Class C shares held by the company may, upon decision of the board of directors be reclassified into ordinary shares. Immediately thereafter, the board of directors shall register the reclassification to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The reclassification is effected when it has been registered and the reclassification been reflected in the central securities depository register.
	

The existing shares shall be ordinary shares.

The Board of Directors proposes that the CEO shall be authorised to make the minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with their registration.

Proposal to resolve to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (item 8)

The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program for Group Management Team and other key employees within the Asker group in accordance with item 8(a) – 8(b) below. The resolutions under items 8(a) – 8(b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 8(b) below not be met, the Board of Directors proposes that the Company shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 8(c) and the resolutions under items 8(a) and 8(c) shall be conditional upon each other. 

Proposal to resolve to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (8(a)) 

Summary of the program 

The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (the “Plan 2025”). The Plan 2025 is proposed to include not more than approximately 132 employees within the Asker group. The participants in the Plan 2025 are required to invest in ordinary shares in Asker (“Investment Shares”). Investment Shares entitle each participant to Performance Share Rights which entitle the participants to, subject to performance conditions, receive “Performance Shares” free of charge in accordance with the terms set out below.

The Board of Directors intends to propose recurring tree year rolling programs subject to the approval of future Annual General Meetings, from the Annual General Meeting 2026 and onwards.

The rationale for the proposal

The rationale for an annual preformance-based investment share program, including the Plan 2025, is to create conditions for motivating and retaining key employees of the Asker group. It is important to Asker’s decentralised and entreprenioural business model that targets of the participants are aligned with those of the Company, including the Company’s business strategy, long-term interest and sustainable business. It is also important to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding Asker’s financial targets. The Board of Directors’ view is that it is desirable that the Group Management Team and other key employees within the Asker group are shareholders and thereby have aligned interests with the Company’s shareholders. 

By offering an allotment of Performance Share Rights, the participants are rewarded for increased shareholder value. Further, the Plan 2025 rewards key employees’ loyalty and long-term value growth in the Company. Against this background, the Board of Directors is of the opinion that the adoption of the Plan 2025 will have a positive effect on the Asker group’s future development and thus be beneficial for both the Company and its shareholders.

Personal investment

In order to participate in the Plan 2025, the participant must have made a private investment in ordinary shares in Asker by investing in Investment Shares. These Investment Shares can either be shares already held or shares purchased on the market in connection with notification to participate in the Plan 2025. Investment Shares held under the Plan 2025 will entitle the Participant to receive “Performance Share Rights”, whereby each Performance Share Right, subject to the performance conditions, entitle the participant to receive one Performance Share free of charge. 

Participants

The participants invited to participate in the Plan 2025 are divided into four categories: 

 * Group CEO, Group Management Team and Business Area Directors (approximately 12 employees): will be offered to invest a total of maximum 255,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 1,414 Investment Shares or more than 9,325 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of five Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, 
 * Country Management (approximately 10 employees): will be offered to invest a total of maximum 70,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 754 Investment Shares or more than 2,825 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of four Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, 
 * Local Managing Directors and Senior Key Specialists (approximately 50 employees): will be offered to invest a total of 198,750 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 472 Investment Shares or more than 2,350 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of three Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, and 
 * Other Key Employees (approximately 60 employees): will be offered to invest a total of 114,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 472 Investment Shares or more than 1,425 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of two Performance Share Rights per Investment Share. 
In total, a maximum of 637,750 Performance Share Rights may be allocated to the participants in the Plan 2025. Individual participants within the same category may receive varying allocations of Performance Share Rights to allow for certain flexibility in the detailed distribution within each category.

In order to enable control and create predictability regarding the maximum outcome per participant and the costs for the Plan 2025, the maximum value of the Performance Shares that can be allocated from each Performance Share Right is limited to 300 percent of the volume-weighted average share price in the Company during September 2025. Should the value of the Performance Shares allocated on the date of allocation of Performance Shares exceed this amount, a proportional reduction in the number of Performance Shares to be allocated shall be made so that the amount is not exceeded.

Terms and conditions

A Performance Share Right may be exercised provided that the participant, with certain exceptions, from the start date of the Plan 2025, up to and including the publication of the Company’s interim financial report for the first quarter 2028 (the “Vesting Period”) has kept their Investment Shares and has maintained their employment within the Asker group. Consequently, the Vesting Period for the Plan 2025 is shorter than three years. The reason for that the Vesting Period is shorter than three years is that the Board of Directors deems it important to implement a long-term share based incentive program after the IPO and annual long-term share based incentive programs are intended to be proposed at future annual general meetings and the Board of Directors deems it important to have the vesting periods ending approximately the same time every year. 

In addition to the requirement for the participant’s maintained employment, the final number of Performance Share Rights which vest shall also be conditional upon the below listed performance conditions: 

 * An adjusted EBITA growth measured as compound annual growth rate (CAGR), 
 * A reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets, and 
 * Percentage of suppliers, based on purchase value, who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code (calculated as a percentage of COGS). 
The performance conditions are split between the three independent conditions listed above with 85 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to the adjusted EBITA growth, 7.5 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to a reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets and 7.5 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to percentage of suppliers who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code. 

Adjusted EBITA

The Adjusted EBITA growth is calculated as the CAGR between the year end result 2024 and the year end result 2027. Should the Company’s Adjusted EBITA growth amount to 17.5 percent, all Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. Should the Company’s Adjusted EBITA growth amount to 12.5 percent, 50 percent of the Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. In the event of an Adjusted EBITA growth between 12.5 and 17.5 percent, Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest linearly. An EBITA growth of less than 12.5 percent entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. The Company’s adjusted EBITA growth amount target shall be recalculated in the event of a share issue.

ESG-targets

Should the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets be achieved (meaning a reduction amounting to at least 31 percent at the end of 2027 vs base line), all Performance Share Rights attributable to the target shall vest. A reduction of less than 31 percent entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to this target vest.

Should the percentage of suppliers, based on purchase value, who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code be achieved (meaning suppliers covering at least 88 percent of COGS at the end of 2027), all Performance Share Rights attributable to the target shall vest. A coverage of less than 88 percent of COGS entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to this target vest.

Other terms and conditions for the Performance Share Rights

The Performance Share Rights shall, in addition to what is set out above, be governed by the following terms and conditions:

 * Performance Share Rights are granted free of charge after adoption of the Plan 2025 and no later than 30 September 2025. 
 * Performance Share Rights vest at the end of the Vesting Period and subject to the performance conditions being fulfilled. 
 * Performance Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged. 
 * The number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right entitles them to will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in the Company’s equity capital structure, such as a bonus issue, merger, rights issue, share split or reverse share split, reduction of the share capital or similar measures. Furthermore, in order to align the participants’ and the shareholders’ interests, the Company will compensate the participants for any dividends paid by increasing the number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right entitles them to. 
Preparation and administration

The Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the Plan 2025, in accordance with the above terms and conditions. In connection therewith, the Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Asker group or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of the Plan 2025 no longer serve their purpose or the rationale for the proposal.

Scope and costs of the Plan 2025

The Plan 2025 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 which stipulates that the Performance Share Rights should be recorded as personnel expenses during the Vesting Period. 

Based on (i) that 637,750 Performance Share Rights are allotted, (ii) an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent, (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent, and (iv) that the performance conditions are fulfilled to 75 percent, the expected annual IFRS costs amount to approximately SEK 14.5 million and annual social security costs of SEK 4.5 million, with a social security tax rate of 21 percent.

Based on (i) that 637,750 Performance Share Rights are allotted, (ii) an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent, (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent, and (iv) that the performance conditions are fulfilled to 100 percent, the expected annual IFRS costs amount to approximately SEK 19.3 million and annual social security costs of SEK 6.7 million, with a social security tax rate of 21 percent.

Dilution

Upon maximum allotment of Performance Shares, including buffer for dividend compensation, and provided that the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 8(b) below are adopted by the Extraordinary General Meeting, 670,000 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Plan 2025, meaning a dilution of approximately 0.17 percent of the number of ordinary shares and votes in the Company. This does not include recalculation pursuant to the terms and conditions other than buffer for dividend compensation.

Preparation of the proposal and previous incentive programs

The Company’s Board of Directors and its remuneration committee have prepared this Plan 2025 in consultation with external advisors. The Plan 2025 has been reviewed by the Board of Directors at a board meetings held in June and July 2025.

Asker has no previous long-term incentive program. 

Proposal to resolve to authorise the Board of Directors to issue class C shares, repurchase issued class C shares and to transfer own ordinary shares (items 8(b)(i)-(iii))

All resolutions under item 8(b)(i)-(iii) are proposed to be conditional upon each other, as well as item 8(a), and are therefore proposed to be adopted in conjunction.

Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue class C shares (item 8(b)(i))

The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors, during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2026, on one or more occasions, to issue not more than 670,000 class C shares, each at quota value. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights, the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorisation and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares under the Plan 2025. The number of shares that can be issued is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events.

Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase own class C shares (item 8(b)(ii))

The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors, during the period until the annual general meeting 2026, on one or more occasions, to repurchase its own class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorisation is to ensure delivery of Performance Shares under the Plan 2025. The number of shares that can be repurchased is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events.

Transfer of own class C shares (item 8(b)(iii))

The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the Company acquires based on the authorisation to repurchase own class C shares in accordance with item 8(b)(ii) above, may, following the reclassification into ordinary shares, be transferred to participants in the Plan 2025 in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions. In total, a maximum of 670,000 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events.

Equity swap agreement with a third party (item 8(c))

Should the majority requirement under item 8(b) above not be met, the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that Asker can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice, whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Asker to the participants in the Plan 2025. 

_______________________

Proposal to amend the articles of association (item 7) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based investment share program, as suggested in item 8 below. To enable the issuance, reclassification, and redemption of class C shares, the Board of Directors proposes to amend the articles of association as follows: An updated wording of section 5 is proposed in the articles of association. Current wording Proposed wording 5 Numbers of shares The number of shares shall be not less than 300,000,000 shares and not more than 1,200,000,000 shares. 5 Numbers of shares The number of shares shall be not less than 300,000,000 shares and not more than 1,200,000,000 shares. The shares shall be issued in two classes, ordinary shares and class C shares. Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share, whereas class C shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company. Holders of class C shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company’s liquidation, class C shares carry equivalent right to the company’s assets as other shares, however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue, one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights). Unless shares offered in such manner are sufficient for the subscription which takes place pursuant to subsidiary pre-emption rights, the shares shall be allotted among the subscribers’ pro rata to the total number of shares previously owned. Where this is not possible with respect to a particular share(s), shares shall be allotted through drawing of lots. The provisions above shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility for the company to adopt a resolution regarding a cash issue or set-off issue without regard to shareholders’ pre-emption rights. The provisions above regarding shareholders’ pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis to an issue of warrants or an issue of convertible instruments. Where the company resolves to issue only one class of shares by way of a cash issue or set-off issue, all shareholders, irrespective of the class of share, shall hold pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares pro rata to the number of shares previously owned. In the event of a bonus issue, new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith, the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue, following the required amendment to the articles of association. Reduction of share capital, which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital, may, upon the request of an owner of class C shares and a resolution by the company’s board of directors or the general meeting, take place through redemption of class C shares. A request from a shareholder shall be made in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed, an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company’s reserve fund, if required funds are available. The redemption amount per C- share shall correspond to the quota value of such share. Following notice of the redemption resolution, holders of shares shall promptly receive payment for the shares, or, if authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court is required, following notice that the final decision has been registered. Class C shares held by the company may, upon decision of the board of directors be reclassified into ordinary shares. Immediately thereafter, the board of directors shall register the reclassification to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The reclassification is effected when it has been registered and the reclassification been reflected in the central securities depository register. The existing shares shall be ordinary shares. The Board of Directors proposes that the CEO shall be authorised to make the minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with their registration. Proposal to resolve to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (item 8) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program for Group Management Team and other key employees within the Asker group in accordance with item 8(a) – 8(b) below. The resolutions under items 8(a) – 8(b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 8(b) below not be met, the Board of Directors proposes that the Company shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 8(c) and the resolutions under items 8(a) and 8(c) shall be conditional upon each other. Proposal to resolve to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (8(a)) Summary of the program The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (the “Plan 2025”). The Plan 2025 is proposed to include not more than approximately 132 employees within the Asker group. The participants in the Plan 2025 are required to invest in ordinary shares in Asker (“Investment Shares”). Investment Shares entitle each participant to Performance Share Rights which entitle the participants to, subject to performance conditions, receive “Performance Shares” free of charge in accordance with the terms set out below. The Board of Directors intends to propose recurring tree year rolling programs subject to the approval of future Annual General Meetings, from the Annual General Meeting 2026 and onwards. The rationale for the proposal The rationale for an annual preformance-based investment share program, including the Plan 2025, is to create conditions for motivating and retaining key employees of the Asker group. It is important to Asker’s decentralised and entreprenioural business model that targets of the participants are aligned with those of the Company, including the Company’s business strategy, long-term interest and sustainable business. It is also important to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding Asker’s financial targets. The Board of Directors’ view is that it is desirable that the Group Management Team and other key employees within the Asker group are shareholders and thereby have aligned interests with the Company’s shareholders. By offering an allotment of Performance Share Rights, the participants are rewarded for increased shareholder value. Further, the Plan 2025 rewards key employees’ loyalty and long-term value growth in the Company. Against this background, the Board of Directors is of the opinion that the adoption of the Plan 2025 will have a positive effect on the Asker group’s future development and thus be beneficial for both the Company and its shareholders. Personal investment In order to participate in the Plan 2025, the participant must have made a private investment in ordinary shares in Asker by investing in Investment Shares. These Investment Shares can either be shares already held or shares purchased on the market in connection with notification to participate in the Plan 2025. Investment Shares held under the Plan 2025 will entitle the Participant to receive “Performance Share Rights”, whereby each Performance Share Right, subject to the performance conditions, entitle the participant to receive one Performance Share free of charge. Participants The participants invited to participate in the Plan 2025 are divided into four categories: * Group CEO, Group Management Team and Business Area Directors (approximately 12 employees): will be offered to invest a total of maximum 255,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 1,414 Investment Shares or more than 9,325 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of five Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, * Country Management (approximately 10 employees): will be offered to invest a total of maximum 70,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 754 Investment Shares or more than 2,825 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of four Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, * Local Managing Directors and Senior Key Specialists (approximately 50 employees): will be offered to invest a total of 198,750 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 472 Investment Shares or more than 2,350 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of three Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, and * Other Key Employees (approximately 60 employees): will be offered to invest a total of 114,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 472 Investment Shares or more than 1,425 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of two Performance Share Rights per Investment Share. In total, a maximum of 637,750 Performance Share Rights may be allocated to the participants in the Plan 2025. Individual participants within the same category may receive varying allocations of Performance Share Rights to allow for certain flexibility in the detailed distribution within each category. In order to enable control and create predictability regarding the maximum outcome per participant and the costs for the Plan 2025, the maximum value of the Performance Shares that can be allocated from each Performance Share Right is limited to 300 percent of the volume-weighted average share price in the Company during September 2025. Should the value of the Performance Shares allocated on the date of allocation of Performance Shares exceed this amount, a proportional reduction in the number of Performance Shares to be allocated shall be made so that the amount is not exceeded. Terms and conditions A Performance Share Right may be exercised provided that the participant, with certain exceptions, from the start date of the Plan 2025, up to and including the publication of the Company’s interim financial report for the first quarter 2028 (the “Vesting Period”) has kept their Investment Shares and has maintained their employment within the Asker group. Consequently, the Vesting Period for the Plan 2025 is shorter than three years. The reason for that the Vesting Period is shorter than three years is that the Board of Directors deems it important to implement a long-term share based incentive program after the IPO and annual long-term share based incentive programs are intended to be proposed at future annual general meetings and the Board of Directors deems it important to have the vesting periods ending approximately the same time every year. In addition to the requirement for the participant’s maintained employment, the final number of Performance Share Rights which vest shall also be conditional upon the below listed performance conditions: * An adjusted EBITA growth measured as compound annual growth rate (CAGR), * A reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets, and * Percentage of suppliers, based on purchase value, who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code (calculated as a percentage of COGS). The performance conditions are split between the three independent conditions listed above with 85 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to the adjusted EBITA growth, 7.5 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to a reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets and 7.5 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to percentage of suppliers who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code. Adjusted EBITA The Adjusted EBITA growth is calculated as the CAGR between the year end result 2024 and the year end result 2027. Should the Company’s Adjusted EBITA growth amount to 17.5 percent, all Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. Should the Company’s Adjusted EBITA growth amount to 12.5 percent, 50 percent of the Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. In the event of an Adjusted EBITA growth between 12.5 and 17.5 percent, Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest linearly. An EBITA growth of less than 12.5 percent entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. The Company’s adjusted EBITA growth amount target shall be recalculated in the event of a share issue. ESG-targets Should the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets be achieved (meaning a reduction amounting to at least 31 percent at the end of 2027 vs base line), all Performance Share Rights attributable to the target shall vest. A reduction of less than 31 percent entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to this target vest. Should the percentage of suppliers, based on purchase value, who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code be achieved (meaning suppliers covering at least 88 percent of COGS at the end of 2027), all Performance Share Rights attributable to the target shall vest. A coverage of less than 88 percent of COGS entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to this target vest. Other terms and conditions for the Performance Share Rights The Performance Share Rights shall, in addition to what is set out above, be governed by the following terms and conditions: * Performance Share Rights are granted free of charge after adoption of the Plan 2025 and no later than 30 September 2025. * Performance Share Rights vest at the end of the Vesting Period and subject to the performance conditions being fulfilled. * Performance Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged. * The number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right entitles them to will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in the Company’s equity capital structure, such as a bonus issue, merger, rights issue, share split or reverse share split, reduction of the share capital or similar measures. Furthermore, in order to align the participants’ and the shareholders’ interests, the Company will compensate the participants for any dividends paid by increasing the number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right entitles them to. Preparation and administration The Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the Plan 2025, in accordance with the above terms and conditions. In connection therewith, the Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Asker group or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of the Plan 2025 no longer serve their purpose or the rationale for the proposal. Scope and costs of the Plan 2025 The Plan 2025 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 which stipulates that the Performance Share Rights should be recorded as personnel expenses during the Vesting Period. Based on (i) that 637,750 Performance Share Rights are allotted, (ii) an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent, (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent, and (iv) that the performance conditions are fulfilled to 75 percent, the expected annual IFRS costs amount to approximately SEK 14.5 million and annual social security costs of SEK 4.5 million, with a social security tax rate of 21 percent. Based on (i) that 637,750 Performance Share Rights are allotted, (ii) an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent, (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent, and (iv) that the performance conditions are fulfilled to 100 percent, the expected annual IFRS costs amount to approximately SEK 19.3 million and annual social security costs of SEK 6.7 million, with a social security tax rate of 21 percent. Dilution Upon maximum allotment of Performance Shares, including buffer for dividend compensation, and provided that the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 8(b) below are adopted by the Extraordinary General Meeting, 670,000 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Plan 2025, meaning a dilution of approximately 0.17 percent of the number of ordinary shares and votes in the Company. This does not include recalculation pursuant to the terms and conditions other than buffer for dividend compensation. Preparation of the proposal and previous incentive programs The Company’s Board of Directors and its remuneration committee have prepared this Plan 2025 in consultation with external advisors. The Plan 2025 has been reviewed by the Board of Directors at a board meetings held in June and July 2025. Asker has no previous long-term incentive program. Proposal to resolve to authorise the Board of Directors to issue class C shares, repurchase issued class C shares and to transfer own ordinary shares (items 8(b)(i)-(iii)) All resolutions under item 8(b)(i)-(iii) are proposed to be conditional upon each other, as well as item 8(a), and are therefore proposed to be adopted in conjunction. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue class C shares (item 8(b)(i)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors, during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2026, on one or more occasions, to issue not more than 670,000 class C shares, each at quota value. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights, the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorisation and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares under the Plan 2025. The number of shares that can be issued is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase own class C shares (item 8(b)(ii)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors, during the period until the annual general meeting 2026, on one or more occasions, to repurchase its own class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorisation is to ensure delivery of Performance Shares under the Plan 2025. The number of shares that can be repurchased is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events. Transfer of own class C shares (item 8(b)(iii)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the Company acquires based on the authorisation to repurchase own class C shares in accordance with item 8(b)(ii) above, may, following the reclassification into ordinary shares, be transferred to participants in the Plan 2025 in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions. In total, a maximum of 670,000 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events. Equity swap agreement with a third party (item 8(c)) Should the majority requirement under item 8(b) above not be met, the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that Asker can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice, whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Asker to the participants in the Plan 2025. _______________________ Special majority requirements A resolution in accordance with the proposal in item 7 above shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds of both votes cast and the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the proposal in item 8(b) above shall only be valid where supported by not less than nine-tenths of both votes cast and the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Shareholders’ right to obtain information The Board of Directors and the CEO shall, if requested by a shareholder and if the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the Company, provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda. Number of shares and votes There are 383,036,497 shares outstanding in Asker, corresponding to 383,036,497 votes. As of the date of this notice, the Company holds no shares. Documentation Relevant documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act will be made available at the Company’s office at Svärdvägen 3A, SE-182 33 Danderyd, and at the Company’s website, no later than three weeks before the Extraordinary General Meeting.

2025-07-22,Bavarian Nordic A/S,Bavarian Nordic Receives Acceptance from Health Canada for Review of the New Drug Submission for its Chikungunya Vaccine," 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 22, 2025
 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced today that Health Canada has accepted for review the Company’s application for licensure of the single-dose, virus-like particle (VLP) chikungunya vaccine candidate, CHIKV VLP, for immunization to prevent disease caused by chikungunya virus infection in individuals 12 years of age and older. The application screening acceptance by the Directorate confirms that the New Drug Submission is complete and begins a standard review procedure, potentially supporting approval of the vaccine in the first half of 2026.
 
The New Drug Submission is based on the data, which also supported the recent US, EU and UK approvals of the vaccine, including results from two phase 3 clinical trials which enrolled more than 3,500 healthy individuals 12 years of age and older. The studies met their primary endpoints, with results showing that 21 days after vaccination, the vaccine induced neutralizing antibodies in up to 97.8% of the vaccinated individuals, (97.8% in individuals 12 years to 64 and 87.3% in over 65 year olds). The key secondary endpoint of seroresponse rate at day 8 post vaccination was 46.6% and 96.8% at day 15 in the 12-64 year old population and 82.3% at day 15 for the over 65 population. The vaccine was well-tolerated and vaccine-related adverse events were mainly mild or moderate in nature. The most common side effects were pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain

Paul Chaplin, President and CEO of Bavarian Nordic
, said:
 “The regulatory submission and acceptance by Health Canada represents yet another highlight in our efforts to expand access to our chikungunya vaccine across the globe. Pending approval, this vaccine will further strengthen our offering for Canadians seeking protection against serious diseases when traveling the world.”
 
About CHIKV VLP
CHIKV VLP is a vaccine for the prevention of chikungunya disease in individuals aged 12 years and above. It is designed to induce a robust seroresponse, with protective immunity starting to develop as early as 1 week after vaccination. Pending regulatory approval, CHIKV VLP vaccine will be available in a prefilled syringe. 
 
CHIKV VLP does not contain viral genetic material and is therefore non-infectious and unable to cause disease, ensuring a broad range of people can benefit from vaccination.
 
The vaccine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission in February 2025

About chikungunya
Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV). In the past 20 years, the virus has emerged across several regions in Asia, Africa, and the Americas, including many popular travel destinations, often causing large unpredictable outbreaks. Since its discovery, CHIKV has been identified in more than 110 countries, with evidence of transmission confirmed in more than 50 countries over the past five years
7
. Chikungunya typically presents with acute symptoms, including fever, rash, fatigue, headache, and often severe and incapacitating joint pain. Most patients recover within 1-2 weeks, but 30-40% of those affected may develop chronic arthritis that can last for months or even years
8
. In 2024, 620,000 cases of chikungunya and over 200 deaths were reported worldwide
9
. Recent data suggest that chikungunya is severely underreported and often misdiagnosed as dengue fever due to a similar symptom profile

2025-07-28,Bavarian Nordic A/S,Consortium Led by Nordic Capital and Permira Will Make All-Cash Recommended Purchase Offer for Bavarian Nordic," 
NOT FOR RELEASE, PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN OR TO ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF THE RELEVANT LAWS OR REGULATIONS OF SUCH JURISDICTION
 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 28, 2025
 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) (“Bavarian Nordic”) announced today that it has entered into an announcement agreement with Innosera ApS (the “Offeror”), a newly formed company controlled by Nordic Capital Fund XI
1
 and funds managed and advised by Permira Beteiligungsberatung GmbH (“Permira”), pursuant to which the Offeror will make an all-cash recommended voluntary public takeover offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Bavarian Nordic (the “Offer”).
 
Highlights of the Offer
 
The offer price is DKK 233 in cash for each share in Bavarian Nordic (the “Offer Price”), valuing the transaction equity of Bavarian Nordic at approx. DKK 19 billion based on the fully diluted shares outstanding.
 
The offer price of DKK 233 per share represents a premium of 21.0% compared to the closing price of DKK 192.50 on Nasdaq Copenhagen on 23 July 2025, the last day of trading prior to the latest Company Announcement no. 20 / 2025 (Rumours of a potential takeover offer for Bavarian Nordic A/S).
 
The Board of Directors notes the trading activity in the Bavarian Nordic share in the weeks leading up to 23 July 2025. Furthermore, the Board of Directors believes that it is relevant to consider premia based on volume-weighted average share prices over a period of time. The Offer Price of DKK 233 per share represents:  
a premium of 31.0% compared to the one-month volume-weighted average share price of DKK 177.92 for the period ending 23 July 2025
a premium of 35.5% compared to the three-month volume-weighted average share price of DKK 171.99 for the period ending 23 July 2025
a premium of 37.4% compared to the six-month volume-weighted average share price of DKK 169.60 for the period ending 23 July 2025
 
 
Based on a thorough assessment, the Board of Directors of Bavarian Nordic
2
 has concluded that the Offer represents an attractive proposal to Bavarian Nordic’s shareholders and has unanimously decided that it intends to recommend that Bavarian Nordic shareholders accept the Offer when made. The Board of Directors made its decision after taking into account, among other factors, the Fairness Opinions (defined below), regarding which further information is set out below. The Board of Directors will publish a statement in respect of the Offer following publication of the offer document, which will include the Board of Directors’ considered statement on the Offer.
 
All members of Bavarian Nordic’s Board of Directors and Executive Management have irrevocably undertaken to tender their shares in the Offer, subject to certain customary conditions. As of today, these shares represent a total of 0.30% of the voting rights and share capital in Bavarian Nordic (excluding treasury shares).
 
The Offeror will, as soon as possible and no later than four weeks from today, publish an offer document approved by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. The offer period is expected to be six weeks from publication of the offer document, subject to any extension of the offer period by the Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer.
 
The Offer will be made subject to certain customary conditions, including a requirement that the Offeror, unless waived, at the expiry of the offer period owns or has received valid acceptances with respect to shares representing more than ninety percent (90%) of the voting rights and share capital of Bavarian Nordic (excluding treasury shares), that necessary approvals and clearances by relevant regulatory authorities are obtained, that the Board of Directors of Bavarian Nordic has not withdrawn or adversely amended its recommendation to the shareholders to accept the Offer, the non-occurrence of certain material adverse changes, and certain other customary conditions.
 
The Offer will not extend to any financial instruments issued by Bavarian Nordic other than shares, including, for the avoidance of doubt, any depositary receipts or sponsored ADR-program for the shares. However, the Offer is being made for the shares underlying the ADRs, subject to the terms and conditions to be set out in the Offer Document.
 
The Offeror expects completion of the Offer, including payment of the consideration to the selling shareholders, in Q4 2025, subject to the receipt of all regulatory approvals and clearances.
 
Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends to seek a delisting of Bavarian Nordic’s shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen, and, if upon completion the Offeror holds the requisite number of shares and voting rights under the Danish Companies Act, the Offeror intends to initiate and complete a compulsory acquisition of the remaining Bavarian Nordic shares.
 
Luc Debruyne, Chair of the Board of Directors of Bavarian Nordic, said: “Our scientific heritage and proven track record of successfully transferring technology and integrating commercial assets has created a unique platform that enables Bavarian Nordic to drive growth and deliver life-saving solutions to patients worldwide. The offer received from Nordic Capital and Permira is the result of intense negotiations aimed at securing the best possible terms for our shareholders. The Board of Directors has unanimously agreed that it intends to recommend that Bavarian Nordic’s shareholders accept the offer when formally submitted. Together with Nordic Capital and Permira, the growth strategy of Bavarian Nordic can be accelerated and strengthen the company’s position in the global vaccine market to the benefit of patients, employees and other stakeholders”.
 
Background and reasons for the Offer

Notice to shareholders in the United States
The Offer, if and when commenced, will be subject to the laws of Denmark. The Offer will relate to the securities of a Danish company and will be subject to the disclosure requirements applicable under Danish law, which may be different in material respects from those applicable in the United States.
 
The Offer, if made, will be made in the United States in compliance with Section 14(e) of, and applicable provisions of Regulation 14E promulgated under, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of Danish law. The Offer will not be subject to Section 14(d)(1) of, or Regulation 14D promulgated under, the Exchange Act. The Offer will be subject to disclosure and procedural requirements that may be different from those applicable to U.S. domestic tender offers, including with respect to withdrawal rights, the Offer timetable, notices of extensions, announcements of results, settlement procedures (including as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered), and waivers of conditions. In addition, any financial information included in the Offer documents may not have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and thus may not be comparable to financial information relating to U.S. companies. Shareholders whose place of residence, seat, or habitual residence is in the United States (“U.S. Shareholders”) are encouraged to consult with their own advisors regarding the Offer.
 
If and when commenced, the Offer will be made to U.S. Shareholders on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders to whom the Offer is made. Any information documents, including the offer to purchase, will be disseminated to U.S. Shareholders on a basis reasonably comparable to the method that such documents are provided to other shareholders.
 
It may be difficult for U.S. Shareholders to enforce certain rights and claims they may have arising in connection with the Offer under U.S. securities laws, since the Offeror and Bavarian Nordic are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and some or all of their respective officers and directors are residents of non-U.S. jurisdictions. U.S. Shareholders may not be able to sue the Offeror or Bavarian Nordic and/or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to compel the Offeror or their respective affiliates, as applicable, to subject themselves to the judgment of a U.S. court.
 
The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Shareholder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each U.S. Shareholder is urged to consult its independent professional advisor immediately regarding the tax consequences to such U.S. Shareholder of accepting the Offer.
 
In accordance with customary Danish practice and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including Rule 14e-5(b) of the Exchange Act, the Offeror or any affiliates or nominees or brokers of the foregoing (acting as agents or in a similar capacity), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares (or any securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for such shares) outside of the U.S., other than pursuant to the Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. If, prior to Completion, the Offeror or any affiliates or any nominee or broker of the foregoing acquires Shares at a higher price than the Offer Price, the Offeror will increase the offer price correspondingly as required by applicable law. In addition, affiliates of the financial advisors to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Bavarian Nordic, which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements are in compliance with applicable law and regulation. Any information about such purchases will be announced through Nasdaq Copenhagen and relevant electronic media if, and to the extent, such announcement is required under applicable law or regulation.

Highlights of the Offer The offer price is DKK 233 in cash for each share in Bavarian Nordic (the “Offer Price”), valuing the transaction equity of Bavarian Nordic at approx. DKK 19 billion based on the fully diluted shares outstanding. The offer price of DKK 233 per share represents a premium of 21.0% compared to the closing price of DKK 192.50 on Nasdaq Copenhagen on 23 July 2025, the last day of trading prior to the latest Company Announcement no. 20 / 2025 (Rumours of a potential takeover offer for Bavarian Nordic A/S). The Board of Directors notes the trading activity in the Bavarian Nordic share in the weeks leading up to 23 July 2025. Furthermore, the Board of Directors believes that it is relevant to consider premia based on volume-weighted average share prices over a period of time. The Offer Price of DKK 233 per share represents: a premium of 31.0% compared to the one-month volume-weighted average share price of DKK 177.92 for the period ending 23 July 2025 a premium of 35.5% compared to the three-month volume-weighted average share price of DKK 171.99 for the period ending 23 July 2025 a premium of 37.4% compared to the six-month volume-weighted average share price of DKK 169.60 for the period ending 23 July 2025 Based on a thorough assessment, the Board of Directors of Bavarian Nordic 2 has concluded that the Offer represents an attractive proposal to Bavarian Nordic’s shareholders and has unanimously decided that it intends to recommend that Bavarian Nordic shareholders accept the Offer when made. The Board of Directors made its decision after taking into account, among other factors, the Fairness Opinions (defined below), regarding which further information is set out below. The Board of Directors will publish a statement in respect of the Offer following publication of the offer document, which will include the Board of Directors’ considered statement on the Offer.

As of today, these shares represent a total of 0.30% of the voting rights and share capital in Bavarian Nordic (excluding treasury shares). The Offeror will, as soon as possible and no later than four weeks from today, publish an offer document approved by the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority. The offer period is expected to be six weeks from publication of the offer document, subject to any extension of the offer period by the Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer.

However, the Offer is being made for the shares underlying the ADRs, subject to the terms and conditions to be set out in the Offer Document. The Offeror expects completion of the Offer, including payment of the consideration to the selling shareholders, in Q4 2025, subject to the receipt of all regulatory approvals and clearances. Following completion of the Offer, the Offeror intends to seek a delisting of Bavarian Nordic’s shares from trading and official listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen, and, if upon completion the Offeror holds the requisite number of shares and voting rights under the Danish Companies Act, the Offeror intends to initiate and complete a compulsory acquisition of the remaining Bavarian Nordic shares.

Such statements are based on the Offeror’s and management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements included in this announcement are based on information available to Bavarian Nordic as of the date of this announcement, and except to the extent Bavarian Nordic may be required to update such information under any applicable securities laws, Bavarian Nordic assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. Restricted jurisdictions The Offer will not be made, and the Bavarian Nordic shares will not be accepted by the Offeror for purchase from or on behalf of persons, in any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the securities or other laws or regulations of such jurisdiction. Persons obtaining this announcement and/or into whose possession this announcement comes are required to take due note and observe all such restrictions and obtain any necessary authorizations, approvals or consents. Neither Bavarian Nordic nor any of its advisors accepts any liability for any violation by any person of any such restriction. Any person (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) who intends to forward this announcement to any jurisdiction outside Denmark should inform themselves of the laws of the relevant jurisdiction, before taking any action. The distribution of this announcement in jurisdictions other than Denmark may be restricted by law, and, therefore, persons who come into possession of this announcement should inform themselves about and observe such restrictions. Any failure to comply with any such restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws and regulations of any such jurisdiction. Notice to shareholders in the United States The Offer, if and when commenced, will be subject to the laws of Denmark. The Offer will relate to the securities of a Danish company and will be subject to the disclosure requirements applicable under Danish law, which may be different in material respects from those applicable in the United States. The Offer, if made, will be made in the United States in compliance with Section 14(e) of, and applicable provisions of Regulation 14E promulgated under, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and otherwise in accordance with the requirements of Danish law. The Offer will not be subject to Section 14(d)(1) of, or Regulation 14D promulgated under, the Exchange Act. The Offer will be subject to disclosure and procedural requirements that may be different from those applicable to U.S. domestic tender offers, including with respect to withdrawal rights, the Offer timetable, notices of extensions, announcements of results, settlement procedures (including as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered), and waivers of conditions. In addition, any financial information included in the Offer documents may not have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and thus may not be comparable to financial information relating to U.S. companies. Shareholders whose place of residence, seat, or habitual residence is in the United States (“U.S. Shareholders”) are encouraged to consult with their own advisors regarding the Offer. If and when commenced, the Offer will be made to U.S. Shareholders on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders to whom the Offer is made. Any information documents, including the offer to purchase, will be disseminated to U.S. Shareholders on a basis reasonably comparable to the method that such documents are provided to other shareholders. It may be difficult for U.S. Shareholders to enforce certain rights and claims they may have arising in connection with the Offer under U.S. securities laws, since the Offeror and Bavarian Nordic are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and some or all of their respective officers and directors are residents of non-U.S. jurisdictions. U.S. Shareholders may not be able to sue the Offeror or Bavarian Nordic and/or their respective officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further, it may not be possible to compel the Offeror or their respective affiliates, as applicable, to subject themselves to the judgment of a U.S. court. The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Shareholder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local, as well as foreign and other, tax laws. Each U.S. Shareholder is urged to consult its independent professional advisor immediately regarding the tax consequences to such U.S. Shareholder of accepting the Offer. In accordance with customary Danish practice and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, including Rule 14e-5(b) of the Exchange Act, the Offeror or any affiliates or nominees or brokers of the foregoing (acting as agents or in a similar capacity), may from time to time make certain purchases of, or arrangements to purchase, shares (or any securities that are convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for such shares) outside of the U.S., other than pursuant to the Offer, before or during the period in which the Offer remains open for acceptance. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. If, prior to Completion, the Offeror or any affiliates or any nominee or broker of the foregoing acquires Shares at a higher price than the Offer Price, the Offeror will increase the offer price correspondingly as required by applicable law. In addition, affiliates of the financial advisors to the Offeror may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Bavarian Nordic, which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements are in compliance with applicable law and regulation. Any information about such purchases will be announced through Nasdaq Copenhagen and relevant electronic media if, and to the extent, such announcement is required under applicable law or regulation. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any securities commission or other regulatory authority in any state of the United States has approved or declined to approve the Offer or any offer documents, passed upon the fairness or merits of the Offer, or provided an opinion as to the accuracy or completeness of this announcement or any other documents regarding the Offer. Any declaration to the contrary constitutes a criminal offense in the United States. This announcement is not intended for distribution in any jurisdiction where such distribution would violate applicable law or regulation. The Offer will be made only through the official offer documents and only to such persons and in such jurisdictions as permitted under applicable law. No recommendation is made as to whether holders of securities should tender their securities in connection with the Offer. Holders of securities should consult their own financial, legal, and tax advisors before making any decision regarding the Offer. 1 “Nordic Capital Fund XI” refers to Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-RAIF (acting through its general partner Nordic Capital Epsilon GP SARL) for and on behalf of its compartment Nordic Capital Epsilon SCA, SICAV-RAIF - Compartment 2. “Nordic Capital” refers to, depending on the context, any, or all, Nordic Capital branded entities, vehicles, structures, and associated entities.

Finnair's Board of Directors decided on a new period for the Performance Share Plan and the establishment of a new Restricted Share Plan



Finnair Plc                  Stock Exchange Release                 28 July 2025 at 10:30 a.m. EEST 

Performance Share Plan  

The Board of Directors of Finnair has approved that a new performance period for years 2025–2027 starts within the company’s Performance Share Plan.  

The Performance Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual performance share plans, each with a three-year performance period. The plan participants can earn Finnair shares as a long-term incentive reward if the performance targets set by the Board of Directors for the plan are achieved. The participants include the Finnair Executive Board, as well as other management and experts. The purpose of the plan is to incentivise the participants to work for increased shareholder value in the long term, and to increase retention. 

The performance targets applied to the plan 2025–2027 are earnings per share, free cash flow, CO2 emissions per revenue tonne kilometre (fuel efficiency, CO2/RTK) and employee engagement score. If the targets set for the plan 2025–2027 are fully achieved, the maximum number of shares to be delivered based on this plan is 3,000,000 shares. This number of shares represents a gross earning, from which payroll tax is deducted, and the remaining net value is delivered to the participants in shares. The number of employees eligible to participate in the plan 2025–2027 is approximately 75 persons. The potential share rewards will be delivered to the participants in the spring of 2028. 

Restricted Share Plan  

The Board of Directors of Finnair has, as part of the long-term incentive scheme structure, decided to establish a Restricted Share Plan.  

The aim of the Restricted Share Plan is to function as a complementary share-based incentive tool to combine the objectives of shareholders with those of the persons participating in the plan and to commit the participants to Finnair. The plan offers participants an opportunity to receive a predetermined number of company’s shares after a specific restriction period. 

The Restricted Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual restricted share plans. The Board of Directors will decide separately on the commencement of each individual plan. Each plan comprises an overall three-year restriction period during which the company may grant fixed share rewards to individually selected key employees. The company may choose to use a shorter restriction period on a case-by-case basis within this overall three-year period. The granted share rewards will be paid after the restriction period. No reward will be paid if the participant’s employment or service ends, or a notice of termination is delivered before the reward payment.  

The maximum number of shares to be delivered based on the plan for years 2025–2027 is 350,000 shares. This number of shares represents a gross earning, from which payroll tax is deducted, and the remaining net value is delivered to the participants in shares. The potential share rewards from plan 2025–2027 will be delivered to the participants in the spring of 2028. 

Other terms related to long-term share-based incentive plans 

The members of Finnair’s Executive Board are expected to retain at least 50% of the net shares received based on the share-based incentive programs, until their share ownership in Finnair corresponds to at least their annual gross base salary. 

The maximum combined value of all variable compensation paid to an individual participant in any given year may not exceed 200% of the participant’s annual gross base salary.

Ericsson announces completion of Aduna transaction

 * Aduna now a 50:50 joint venture: 50 percent owned by Ericsson and 50 percent owned by twelve communications service providers (CSPs) 
 * Aduna has been operational since its formation announcement on September 11, 2024 
 * Aduna ecosystem comprises CSP, major developer platform companies, global system integrators (GSI), communication platform as a service (CPaaS) companies, and independent software vendor (ISV) partners 
Today, Ericsson (NASDAQ: ERIC) announces the completion of the equity investments by twelve global communication service providers (CSPs) into its subsidiary Aduna, formally establishing Aduna as a 50:50 joint venture. Aduna was created to combine and sell aggregated network Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) globally. It has been operational since the deal signed on 11 September 2024.

Aduna is now owned by AT&T, Bharti Airtel, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, KDDI, Orange, Reliance Jio, Singtel, Telefonica, Telstra, T-Mobile, Verizon and Vodafone. 

In addition to funding and commercial agreements, the shareholders bring to Aduna a wealth of support in the industry, including through telecom operator relationships, knowledge of the developer community, and expertise in network APIs.  Ericsson also contributed its global network platform, on which Aduna will build and refine its offering.

Ericsson holds 50 percent of the venture equity, with the remaining 50 percent held by the above-named CSPs combined.

Aduna CEO, Anthony Bartolo, says: “The closing of the transaction is another important step for Aduna. In just ten months we have built an impressive ecosystem comprising the biggest names in telecoms and the wider ICT industry. The closing provides renewed motivation for Aduna to accelerate the adoption of network APIs by developers on a global scale. This includes encouraging more telecom operators to join the new company, further driving the industry and developer experience.”

In addition to the founding venture partners, the rapidly-expanding Aduna ecosystem includes a diverse range of technology and collaboration partnerships. These span additional CSPs worldwide, as well as major developer platform companies, global system integration (GSI) companies, communication platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) companies, and independent software vendor (ISV) companies.

To date these include: e&, Bouygues Telecom, Free, CelcomDigi, Softbank, NTT DOCOMO, Google Cloud, Vonage, Sinch, Infobip, Enstream, Bridge Alliance, Syniverse, JT Global, Microsoft, Wipro and Tech Mahindra – each playing a vital role in advancing the reach and impact of network APIs worldwide.

Latest data presented at AAIC 2025 reinforces lecanemab’s clinical effect with consistent safety profile

Stockholm, Sweden, July 31, 2025 – BioArctic AB's (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) partner Eisai presented the latest findings on lecanemab (Leqembi®) at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC), held in Toronto, July 27 to 31. The presentations included four-year treatment data from the phase 3 Clarity AD open-label extension study, data on subcutaneous dosing and interim data from an ongoing real-world evidence study. The data further reinforces the clinical efficacy of lecanemab, with a safety profile in line with the phase 3 Clarity AD core study results.

1. Four years of lecanemab treatment helped patients remain in early stage of Alzheimer’s disease longer compared to natural disease course, with consistent safety profile
In the core phase 3 study of lecanemab in early Alzheimer’s disease, Clarity AD, the mean change from baseline between the lecanemab treated group and the placebo group after 18 months was -0.45 (p=0.00005) on the primary endpoint of CDR-SB global cognitive and functional scale, corresponding to a 27% slowing of clinical decline. A change from 0.5 to 1 on the CDR score domains of Memory, Community Affairs and Home/Hobbies reflect a shift from mild impairment to loss of independence.

Of the patients who completed the core study, 95% chose to continue in the open-label extension study (OLE). Over three years of treatment, including both the core study and the OLE, lecanemab demonstrated 1.01 points less decline, measured by CDR-SB, compared to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)[i] cohort. This benefit became more pronounced after four years, with a less decline of 1.75 points. Similarly, when benchmarked against the expected decline in the BioFINDER[ii] cohort, lecanemab showed a 1.40-point difference over three years and 2.17-point difference at the four-year mark. These data indicate that lecanemab treatment slows disease progression by approximately one year compared to no treatment over a four-year period.

The Clarity AD study included a tau PET sub study. Among participants of this sub study with low levels of tau, an indicator for early-stage Alzheimer's disease, 69% showed improvement or no decline, and 56% showed improvement from baseline on the CDR-SB after four years of lecanemab treatment. Similar results were observed on the ADAS-Cog14 scale (51% and 51% respectively) and on the ADCS-MCI-ADL scale (64% and 58% respectively). These findings suggest that initiating and maintaining treatment with lecanemab in early-stage Alzheimer’s disease may slow clinical decline and offer sustained long-term benefits. 

No new safety findings were observed in the OLE with continued lecanemab treatment over four years. Rates of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) decreased after the initial 12 months and remained consistent throughout four years of continuous treatment.

2. Interim real-world data show 84% of patients on lecanemab either remained stable or clinically improved with a safety profile in line with phase 3 data
A retrospective, multicenter, real-world study in the United States showed that a large majority of patients remained at the same clinical stage or improved from mild dementia to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with about 77% remaining stable and 7% showing improvement. The results encompass data from 178 patient case studies across nine diverse U.S. sites. Patients received lecanemab for an average of 375 days and a mean of 25 doses. 

The data also revealed that a longer treatment duration correlated with increased effectiveness. Notably, 20% of patients receiving 40 or more doses (around 18 months; n=15) improved from mild Alzheimer’s disease to MCI. Furthermore, the interim data showed high retention rates with approximately 87% of patients continuing therapy, as well as safety data in line with the FDA-approved label, with most ARIA cases reported as asymptomatic (1.1% symptomatic ARIA-E and 0% symptomatic ARIA-H).

The full study will include 15 healthcare professionals (HCPs) and 320 patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, with final results expected by the end of 2025. 

3. Subcutaneous dosing of lecanemab could offer a new option for treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease
Several clinical trials investigating subcutaneous (SC) dosing of lecanemab have been conducted, including a sub-study within the open-label extension of the phase 3 Clarity AD study. These trials evaluated various doses administered subcutaneously. Eisai has developed a SC autoinjector to deliver a weekly maintenance dose of 360 mg, and a 500 mg SC autoinjector is currently being developed for initiation dosing.

Data presented at the AAIC demonstrate that transitioning to a weekly 360 mg SC autoinjector dose of lecanemab, following 18 months of initiation dosing with 10 mg/kg (IV) biweekly, maintains clinical and biomarker benefits comparable to continued biweekly intravenous administration. Data also show the 500 mg SC autoinjector provides equivalent exposure to the initial 10 mg/kg intravenous biweekly treatment regimen up to 18 months, with comparable effects on amyloid removal, efficacy, and ARIA-E.

The safety profile of 360 mg weekly SC maintenance dose was consistent with that of IV maintenance therapy, with systemic injection or infusion reactions occurring in less than 1% of patients. Across all SC doses, the rate of systemic injection/infusion reactions was 1% compared to 26% with IV. The 360 mg SC maintenance dose was initiated after 18 months of intravenous treatment, beyond the high-risk period for ARIA. No cases of ARIA-E were observed among 49 treated with the 360 mg SC weekly maintenance dose over an average of six months.

In addition, two studies – one evaluating human factors and another assessing subcutaneous autoinjector device tolerability – found that subcutaneous dosing allows patients to easily use the device at home, shortens treatment time, and enables continuation of therapy without visits to an infusion center, according to patients and care partners. Healthcare professionals reported that the device has the potential to offer a new option for patients benefiting from lecanemab treatment. The SC formulation has the potential to reduce medical preparation and administration time related to intravenous therapy. These factors suggest that the SC autoinjector may play an important role in the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease.

Eisai serves as the lead of Leqembi development and regulatory submissions globally with both Eisai and Biogen co-commercializing and co-promoting the product and Eisai having final decision-making authority. BioArctic has the right to commercialize Leqembi in the Nordic region together with Eisai and the two companies are preparing for a joint commercialization in the region.

&nbsp;

ABB announced today that it will invest more than CA$130 million (around US$100 million) to expand the R&amp;D and production capacity of its advanced power protection and grid resilience technologies in Canada. The investment in Montreal, Quebec will combine ABB&rsquo;s existing Iberville and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu facilities at a new greenfield location. This will enable ABB to meet increasing demand in key growth industries, including utilities, renewables, transportation, and residential and infrastructure projects across Canada.

The new 340,000 sq. ft. manufacturing and R&amp;D facility will be more than 33 percent larger than the two locations it replaces and will incorporate advanced production automation and digital technologies. Combining the existing ABB operations at Iberville and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu will bring more than 600 existing employees from manufacturing, R&amp;D, engineering, testing and support functions into one location. As new product lines are added and production increases in the future, further jobs will be created. 

&ldquo;Our investment will support our future growth in Canada, as demand increases with customers focused on grid resilience, power distribution and renewables, and in new transportation, buildings and infrastructure projects,&rdquo; said Khalid Mandri, President, ABB Installation Products. &ldquo;The teams in our advanced new facility will deliver products and innovation that will help power businesses and homes across the country. Together with recent investments made in the US and in Europe, the opening of this new facility will be a key part of our global growth strategy.&rdquo; 

The new site is expected to open in mid-2027 and will be located in the South Shore region of Montreal, Quebec. The new building will integrate clean, energy-efficient electrical equipment and heating systems to reduce energy consumption and cut carbon emissions by over 95 percent, compared with the two existing facilities.

The project is supported by funding of CA$16 million (US$12 million) from Investissement Qu&eacute;bec. 

Today, more than 80 percent of solutions sold in Canada by ABB Installation Products are made or assembled domestically, using 70 percent locally sourced materials&mdash;including 100 percent Canadian steel and aluminum. 

This is ABB&#39;s largest investment to date in Canada. Over the past decade, ABB has invested around US$275 million in its Canadian operations to support advanced manufacturing, innovation, and workforce development. These investments include upgrades to key facilities, the integration of cutting-edge automation technologies, and the expansion of local capabilities and production capacity.&nbsp;

ABB is a global technology leader in electrification and automation, enabling a more sustainable and resource-efficient future. By connecting its engineering and digitalization expertise, ABB helps industries run at high performance, while becoming more efficient, productive and sustainable so they outperform.

He has a strong track record driving profitable growth, most recently within surface drilling and exploration. José Manuel is a Spanish citizen born in 1963 and holds a M.Sc. in Mining from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain, as well as a Master of Marketing and Sales Management from Cerem International Business School, Spain. Currently, José Manuel is the Division President for the Epiroc Surface Division. José Manuel will be located in USA. 
Epiroc’s current eight separate and focused, yet integrated divisions will continue to have the operational responsibility, but from September 1, 2025, the Division Presidents will report to the respective Business Area President instead of to the CEO. As a result, the Epiroc Group Management will consist of six positions in total, a reduction from the previous 13 positions. 

“This reporting structure will in the coming years support our high ambition of outperformance, with 8% annual revenue growth and market-leading profitability, as it will make us both faster and more effective in an ever-changing world,” says Helena Hedblom, President and CEO. “The increased focus will mainly benefit our customers, as we can be even more precise and reliable when it comes to delivering our productivity-enhancing products and solutions. With these two appreciated leaders with strong track records onboard as Business Area Presidents, we will accelerate the transformation further.”

H. Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) raises the financial guidance for the full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth at constant exchange rates (CER).

Financial guidance

Growth (CER)	Previous 2025 guidance	Revised 2025 guidance 	
Revenue	8% - 11%	11% - 13%	
Adjusted EBITDA	8% - 14%	16% - 21%	

In the first half of 2025, Lundbeck’s revenue increased by 14% and adjusted EBITDA increased by 24% both at CER. 

Key figures

Growth (CER)	H1 2025	Q2 2025

EBITDA	+28%	+34%	
Adjusted EBITDA	+24%	+25%	

Additional information will be available in the Corporate Release: Financial report for the period 1 January to 30 June 2025.

The above expectations to the revised 2025 outlook are based on assumptions including those described in the Financial Reports for the period 1 January 2025 to 31 March 2025 (Corporate Release No 772 / 2025) and the release for the period 1 January to 30 June 2025 (Corporate Release No. 775 / 2025) to announced shortly.

Lundbeck’s total revenue grew by +14% CER[1] (+14% DKK) to DKK 12,258 million in the first six months of 2025. Growth in the U.S. and Europe was the driver of this strong performance.

 * United States: DKK 6,524 million (+22% CER; +23% DKK) 
 * Europe: DKK 2,868 million (+14% CER; +14% DKK) 
 * International Operations: DKK 2,724 million (+0% CER; -3% DKK) 
The revenue of Lundbeck’s strategic brands increased by +21% CER (+21% DKK), reaching DKK 9,436 million, representing 77% of total revenue 

 * Rexulti®: DKK 3,039 million (+28% CER; +28% DKK) 
 * Brintellix®/Trintellix®: DKK 2,390 million (+3% CER; +2% DKK) 
 * Vyepti®: DKK 2,105 million (+56% CER; +57% DKK) 
 * Abilify LAI franchise[2]: DKK 1,902 million (+10% CER; +10% DKK) 
Adjusted EBITDA[3] reached DKK 4,221 million, growing +24% CER (+25% DKK), driven by continuous strong momentum across strategic brands fueled by the strong performance of Vyepti® and Rexulti® as well as part of the successful execution of the Focused Innovator Strategy reinforcing Lundbeck’s market leadership across key therapeutic areas. 

Adjusted EBITDA margin (DKK) reached 34.4% equivalent to an increase of 3.1 percentage points, driven by the strong performance of strategic brands and supported by disciplined resource allocation and capital reallocation in line with our Focused Innovator strategy. These measures more than offset increased R&D investments. EBITDA increased to DKK 4,150 million (+28% CER; +29% DKK). 

Financial guidance 2025 raised

On 13 August 2025, Lundbeck announced an increase in its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance at CER. Revenue is now expected to grow by 11% to 13% at CER, up from the previous forecast of 8% to 11%, compared to the prior year’s revenue excluding hedging effects. Adjusted EBITDA growth is now projected at 16% to 21% at CER, previously 8% to 14%, also excluding hedging effects. Further details can be found in section 2.8 Outlook.

Lundbeck’s President and CEO, Charl van Zyl said:

""I am pleased to present an impressive performance for the first half of 2025 with strong outlook for remainder of the year, forming the basis for our raised financial guidance and reflecting the continued momentum of our Focused Innovator strategy. Supported by our successful capital reallocation program, this sustained growth is driven by our strategic brands. Both Vyepti® and Rexulti® continue to gain market share in the U.S., with Vyepti® being the fastest-growing anti-CGRP therapy.”

Recent events

On 13 August 2025, Lundbeck communicated that the full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook at CER have been raised.

On 18 July 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee voted 1–10 against the efficacy of brexpiprazole with sertraline for PTSD, concluding that its effectiveness has not been established. This outcome, based on the evidence presented, will be considered by the FDA as it continues its review of the application.

On 24 June 2025, Lundbeck announced that orphan drug designation has been granted to Lu AG13909 by the FDA on 12 May 2025 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 20 June 2025. Lu AG13909 is a novel, humanized monoclonal antibody, under investigation for the treatment of patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), a rare genetic disease. 

On 21 June 2025, Lundbeck shared results from the phase IV RESOLUTION trial at the European Academy of Neurology Congress. The placebo-controlled trial assessed eptinezumab in chronic migraine patients with medication-overuse headache, alongside standardized education. Eptinezumab met all primary and secondary endpoints, significantly reducing monthly migraine days from Weeks 1 to 4 compared to placebo.

On 21 June 2025, Lundbeck announced full results from the SUNRISE trial at the European Academy of Neurology Congress. This placebo-controlled study evaluated eptinezumab in a predominantly Asian chronic migraine population. The trial met all primary and secondary endpoints, with eptinezumab reducing migraine frequency, severe pain episodes, and overall disease burden more effectively than placebo.

On 22 May 2025, Lundbeck announced it has successfully placed an aggregate principal amount of EUR 500 million senior unsecured notes with a tenor of four years maturing 2 June 2029 under its EUR 2 billion Euro Medium Term Note Programme.

DRiiV Solutions has designed and delivered a unique charging infrastructure with Kempower equipment to Stavanger Airport as part of a trial to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation


The Kempower Control Unit charger will power a new fully-electric plane that will fly between Stavanger airport and Bergen airport from autumn 2025


Regular cargo test flights between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport will help prove the viability of electric aircraft.






Stavanger, Norway – August 14, 2025 – Kempower’s sales and service partner, DRiiV Solutions, has delivered charging infrastructure with Kempower equipment to Stavanger Airport as part of a trial to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation. The charger will power a new fully-electric plane that will fly between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport from autumn 2025.


Norway is leading the way for aviation electrification. Its mountainous terrain means small planes taking short trips are a key method of transportation, and it is such flights that are most suitable for electrification. In April 2024, the Norwegian Airport operator Avinor and the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway entered a collaboration to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation. The initiative aims to accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation through demonstration flights and infrastructure development.


The regular test route between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport is the first project to be launched as part of the initiative. The cargo flights will be carried out by a fully electric ALIA aircraft from the American aircraft manufacturer BETA and flown by Bristow Norway. It is hoped that the test flights will prove the viability of electric aircraft.
In a project led by DRiiV Solutions, a Kempower Control Unit, connected to a Kempower Power Unit, capable of delivering up to 300kW has been installed at Stavanger Airport to power the electric aircraft. The DRiiV team devised a unique charging set-up, burying the Kempower Control Unit’s 5m-long (16ft) charging cable. The Control Unit itself is kept in a box that can be heated, protecting it from snow. This design makes the charger usable year-round.


The aircraft had its first test flight on Friday, August the 8th, 2025, with the trial flights scheduled to begin in early autumn.


“The electrification of road vehicles is seeing tremendous success and now it’s time for the aviation sector to join the movement. Norway is an attractive market for early introduction of new technologies and will be an important player in pushing us towards achieving fossil-free aviation by 2050.” 
commented 
Kristoffer Hurv
, Managing Director at DRiiV Solutions.
""This is also a great example of how we stand out by delivering solutions tailored to all types of electric vehicles – whether it’s aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, or passenger cars. We’re also very proud and grateful for our strong partnership with Kempower, which makes projects like this possible,"" 
he added.
“We are proud to support this world-leading trial with our valued partner, DRiiV Solutions, which has been working with us for just over a year,”
 commented 
Erik Kanerva
, Kempower’s Sales Director for North Europe.
 
“Throughout this time, the DRiiV Solutions team has steadily deepened its knowledge of our products and solutions, demonstrating a strong commitment to quality and innovation. This airplane project reflects DRiiV Solutions’ vision and expertise, and we are incredibly proud that they have chosen us as their trusted supplier. We are excited to see how the trials develop, as Norway continues to push the development of electric aviation forward,” he added.

The charger will power a new fully-electric plane that will fly between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport from autumn 2025. Kempower electrifies Norwegian flights by delivering charging infra for a fully-electric plane at Stavanger airport 14.8.2025 11:00:00 | Kempower Oyj | News Kempower’s sales and service partner, DRiiV Solutions, has delivered charging infrastructure with Kempower equipment to Stavanger Airport as part of a trial to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation. The charger will power a new fully-electric plane that will fly between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport from autumn 2025. DRiiV Solutions has designed and delivered a unique charging infrastructure with Kempower equipment to Stavanger Airport as part of a trial to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation The Kempower Control Unit charger will power a new fully-electric plane that will fly between Stavanger airport and Bergen airport from autumn 2025 Regular cargo test flights between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport will help prove the viability of electric aircraft. Stavanger, Norway – August 14, 2025 – Kempower’s sales and service partner, DRiiV Solutions, has delivered charging infrastructure with Kempower equipment to Stavanger Airport as part of a trial to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation. The charger will power a new fully-electric plane that will fly between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport from autumn 2025. Norway is leading the way for aviation electrification. Its mountainous terrain means small planes taking short trips are a key method of transportation, and it is such flights that are most suitable for electrification. In April 2024, the Norwegian Airport operator Avinor and the Civil Aviation Authority of Norway entered a collaboration to establish Norway as an international test arena for zero and low-emission aviation. The initiative aims to accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation through demonstration flights and infrastructure development. The regular test route between Stavanger Airport and Bergen Airport is the first project to be launched as part of the initiative. The cargo flights will be carried out by a fully electric ALIA aircraft from the American aircraft manufacturer BETA and flown by Bristow Norway. It is hoped that the test flights will prove the viability of electric aircraft. In a project led by DRiiV Solutions, a Kempower Control Unit, connected to a Kempower Power Unit, capable of delivering up to 300kW has been installed at Stavanger Airport to power the electric aircraft. The DRiiV team devised a unique charging set-up, burying the Kempower Control Unit’s 5m-long (16ft) charging cable. The Control Unit itself is kept in a box that can be heated, protecting it from snow. This design makes the charger usable year-round. The aircraft had its first test flight on Friday, August the 8th, 2025, with the trial flights scheduled to begin in early autumn. “The electrification of road vehicles is seeing tremendous success and now it’s time for the aviation sector to join the movement. Norway is an attractive market for early introduction of new technologies and will be an important player in pushing us towards achieving fossil-free aviation by 2050.” commented Kristoffer Hurv , Managing Director at DRiiV Solutions. ""This is also a great example of how we stand out by delivering solutions tailored to all types of electric vehicles – whether it’s aircraft, heavy-duty trucks, or passenger cars. We’re also very proud and grateful for our strong partnership with Kempower, which makes projects like this possible,"" he added. “We are proud to support this world-leading trial with our valued partner, DRiiV Solutions, which has been working with us for just over a year,” commented Erik Kanerva , Kempower’s Sales Director for North Europe. “Throughout this time, the DRiiV Solutions team has steadily deepened its knowledge of our products and solutions, demonstrating a strong commitment to quality and innovation. This airplane project reflects DRiiV Solutions’ vision and expertise, and we are incredibly proud that they have chosen us as their trusted supplier. We are excited to see how the trials develop, as Norway continues to push the development of electric aviation forward,” he added. Photos Photos of the Norwegian minister of climate and environment, Andreas Bjelland Eriksen, at the new electric aircraft charger at Stavanger Airport, are taken by Camilla Walla/Avinor.

Metsä Board awarded EcoVadis Platinum rating again – among the top 1% of the world’s most sustainable companies in its category

Metsä Board Corporation press release 14.08.2025

Metsä Board, the leading European producer of premium fresh fibre paperboards and part of Metsä Group, has once again achieved the highest Platinum level in the 2025 EcoVadis sustainability assessment. The company has achieved the highest level rating every year since 2017.

Metsä Board ranks among the top 1% of companies globally in the category of paper, paperboard, and packaging manufacturers with a score 87/100. The company received high scores across all four assessment categories: environment, labour and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement.

""Our customers place a high value on strong sustainability performance. Our consistent top performance in the EcoVadis assessment year after year reflects our dedication to environmental and social responsibility. We have recently updated our 2030 sustainability targets and climate transition plan to further support our customers in achieving their own sustainability goals, such as reducing the carbon footprint of packaging solutions,"" says Esa Kaikkonen Metsä Board's CEO.

The EcoVadis platform enables companies to assess the sustainability performance of their suppliers globally. The evaluation covers four key areas: environment, labour and human rights, ethics, and sustainable procurement.

The methodology and criteria used are in line with international sustainability standards including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), UN Global Compact, and ISO 26000.

Metsä Board is a producer of lightweight and high-quality folding boxboards, food service boards and white kraftliners. The fresh wood fibres we use in our products are a renewable and recyclable resource, that can be traced back to Northern European forests. We aim to have completely fossil-free mills and raw materials by 2030. We promote a culture of diversity, equality and inclusion.

Metsä Board is listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki. In 2024 our sales totalled EUR 1.9 billion, and we have around 2,300 employees. Metsä Board is part of Metsä Group, whose parent company Metsäliitto Cooperative is owned by over 90,000 Finnish forest owners.

COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 22-2025 
 
FLSmidth & Co. A/S 
14 August 2025
 
Copenhagen, Denmark
 
 
Today, FLSmidth announces preliminary and unaudited financial results for Q2 2025 and H1 2025. In addition, the financial guidance for the full year 2025 is updated.
 
As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 change its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry.
 
As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders.

To illustrate the underlying business performance, FLSmidth presents an Adjusted EBITA margin, which excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses totalling DKK 50m and DKK 101m for Q2 2025 and H1 2025, respectively. In addition, the Adjusted EBITA margin now also excludes Other Operating Net Income totalling income of DKK 59m and DKK 77m in Q2 2025 and H1 2025, respectively.

The financial guidance for the full year 2025 has been updated. As such, FLSmidth now expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements.
 
In addition, FLSmidth now expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.
 
Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for original equipment is expected to remain soft.
 
The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.
 
 
Presentation of the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report
FLSmidth will, as previously communicated, release the detailed and unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025 on 20 August 2025.
 
FLSmidth will host a conference call for investors and analysts on Wednesday 20 August 2025 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. The presentation can be followed live or viewed as a replay via the internet

EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% The financial guidance for the full year 2025 has been updated. As such, FLSmidth now expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth now expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for original equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025. Presentation of the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report FLSmidth will, as previously communicated, release the detailed and unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025 on 20 August 2025. FLSmidth will host a conference call for investors and analysts on Wednesday 20 August 2025 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. The presentation can be followed live or viewed as a replay via the internet here .

Financial outlook for 2025
The financial outlook was updated in Company Announcement No. 19 of 14 August 2025. Revenue (standard metal prices) is expected to be approximately EUR 2.65-2.75bn (previously approximately 2.37-2.52bn) and operational EBITDA is expected to be approximately EUR 360-390m (previously approximately EUR 330-380m). 
 
The financial outlook is subject to several assumptions including: 
 
Satisfactory execution of high-voltage projects and investments to deliver on expected profitability margins 
Satisfactory operational execution across business lines 
Stable market conditions for Applications and Service & Accessories 
Normalised offshore power cable repair work activity 
Stable supply chain with limited disruptions and access to the required labour, materials, and services 
Stable development in the global economy, foreign currency, and metal prices 
 
13% organic growth and operational EBITDA of EUR 105m
In Q2 2025, NKT’s revenue (in std. metal prices) amounted to EUR 723m, an increase of EUR 118m compared to Q2 2024, corresponding to 13% organic growth. In Solutions, the growth was driven by a high activity level and overall satisfactory project execution, while the increased revenue in Applications was driven by the acquisition of SolidAl in June 2024, and organic growth from additional medium-voltage production capacity. In Service & Accessories, revenue growth was driven by a higher activity level in the Accessories business.
 
Operational EBITDA increased to a record-high level of EUR 105m in Q2 2025 compared to EUR 86m in Q2 2024. The increase was driven by the Applications and Service & Accessories business lines. The operational EBITDA margin* was 14.5%, slightly above the 14.2% reported in Q2 2024.
 
At end-Q2 2025, the high-voltage order backlog was EUR 10.1bn (EUR 8.9bn in standard metal prices) compared to EUR 10.7bn (EUR 9.4bn in standard metal prices) at end-Q1 2025. During the quarter, NKT supplemented its high-voltage order backlog with a number of relatively smaller orders, including variation orders to existing projects.
 
Free cash flow amounted to EUR -175m in Q2 2025, mainly driven by the ongoing investment programmes. At end-Q2 2025, NKT maintained a robust balance sheet, with net interest-bearing debt of EUR -757m.
 
Execution of the high-voltage capacity investments progressed as planned during Q2 2025. At the expansion of the site in Karlskrona, Sweden, intense execution continued across several workstreams. The work inside the new extrusion tower progressed, as well as construction of surrounding buildings and expansion of the harbour facilities. During the quarter, the new logistics centre was inaugurated as the first completed building.
 
Construction of the new cable-laying vessel, NKT Eleonora, also progressed as planned. Both the new production capacity and the new cable-laying vessel are expected to be gradually operational from 2027.

Fortum January–June 2025 Half-year Financial Report: Despite strong achieved power price, results affected by low generation volumes and market prices

FORTUM CORPORATION INTERIM REPORT 15 AUGUST 2025 AT 9:00 EEST

This release is a summary of Fortum’s January–June 2025 Half-year Financial Report. The complete report is attached to this release as a PDF file. It is also available on the company's website at www.fortum.com/investors.

Despite strong achieved power price, results affected by low generation volumes and market prices

April–June 2025

 * Comparable EBITDA was EUR 191 (326) million. 
 * Comparable operating profit was EUR 115 (233) million due to lower generation volumes and lower power prices. 
 * Operating profit was EUR 104 (240) million. 
 * Comparable earnings per share were EUR 0.09 (0.20). 
 * Earnings per share were EUR 0.12 (0.24). 
 * Cash flow from operating activities totalled EUR 203 (338) million. 
January–June 2025 

 * Comparable EBITDA was EUR 729 (948) million. 
 * Comparable operating profit was EUR 577 (763) million mainly due to lower generation volumes and lower power prices. 
 * Operating profit was EUR 574 (812) million. 
 * Comparable earnings per share were EUR 0.51 (0.68). 
 * Earnings per share were EUR 0.52 (0.77). 
 * Cash flow from operating activities totalled EUR 656 (876) million. 
Summary of outlook

 * The Generation segment’s estimated Nordic generation hedges: approximately 80% at EUR 41 per MWh for the remainder of 2025 and approximately 60% at EUR 40 per MWh for 2026. 
 * For 2025, the annual optimisation premium included in the achieved power price for the whole outright portfolio is estimated to be in the range of 7–9 EUR/MWh. 
 * UPDATED: In 2025, the total generation volumes are expected to be clearly below the normal level. Currently, the expected decrease of total nuclear volumes for the full year is 2.9 TWh, 1.3 TWh of which realised in the first half of 2025. Of the effect expected in the second half of the year, the majority is estimated to materialise in the third quarter. Fortum assumes that its annual hydro volume in 2025 will be below that of a normal hydro year, which has been 20-20.5 TWh. 
 * Capital expenditure for 2025–2027, including maintenance but excluding acquisitions, is expected to be approximately EUR 1.4 billion, of which annual growth capital expenditure is expected to be EUR 150–300 million and annual maintenance capital expenditure EUR 250 million.

Fortum’s President and CEO Markus Rauramo:

“During the second quarter of 2025, power prices were under pressure both from abundant hydro reservoirs at the beginning of the quarter and from increased wind production. However, very low inflows due to modest spring floods and higher Nordic hydro generation decreased the reservoir surplus rapidly. Nordic demand increased moderately compared to the same period last year, with industrial demand still slightly lagging behind pre-energy-crisis levels.

Our second-quarter comparable result was affected by the decline in the Generation segment’s result arising from lower generation volumes and power prices. Our hydro and nuclear output was 2.2 TWh below last year’s second quarter, mainly due to lower hydro inflows and an extended outage at the Oskarshamn nuclear plant. Despite this, our achieved power price was almost at last year’s level at 48.1 (48.6) EUR/MWh, supported by a high hedge ratio and good physical optimisation. We are very pleased that our Consumer Solutions segment recorded its strongest second-quarter comparable operating profit so far, driven by improved gas and electricity margins and realised cost synergies from the brand mergers completed in 2024. The Other Operations segment also saw an improvement in its comparable result due to divestments carried out in 2024.

During the second quarter, we acquired the Polish electricity solutions provider Orange Energia for a maximum of EUR 28 million on a cash and debt-free basis. Orange Energia is one of the largest independent electricity retailers in Poland with a portfolio of approximately 130,000 customer contracts. Through the acquisition, we doubled our number of retail customers in Poland.

Our financial position remains strong also following the dividend payment of EUR 1.3 billion. At the end of the second quarter, our financial net debt was EUR 1.3 billion, and our leverage ratio stood at 0.9 times.

After the reporting period, we announced the acquisition of a project development portfolio for wind power in Finland from the German renewables developer and constructor ABO Energy. This acquisition strengthens Fortum’s development pipeline for renewable power as we prepare for future growth by developing ready-to-build projects in the Nordic countries. With the acquired 4.4 GW portfolio, Fortum’s pipeline of onshore wind and solar projects in the permitting phase across the Nordic countries reaches approximately 8 GW, with more projects in early development phase.

The new power demand projections from Nordic Transmission System Operators (TSOs), updated in June, expect the Nordic power demand to grow to 550 TWh per annum by 2030. The estimate decreased slightly from earlier, mainly due to a postponement in expected demand from hydrogen production which was partly offset by increased demand from data centres. We continue to see robust underlying customer demand from various industrial sectors, which we believe reflects the power demand growth longer term, although we have not signed any significant new long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). Currently, customers are signing short- and mid-term contracts over the next 3-5 years. 

Uncertainty in the operating environment has remained strong due to ongoing geopolitical conflicts and US tariff plans and may pose challenges to major industrial investments in the Nordics. To support economic growth and long-term investment planning, a steady and reliable regulatory framework remains essential. This is relevant, for example, for the taxation of planned data centres. In our view, public intervention should serve to support industrial investments rather than restrict them.""

OUTLOOK CHALLENGED BY MEDITERRANEAN HEADWINDS
 
 
 
COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT no. 24 - 15 August 2025
 
 
2025 is a transitional year to improve financial performance following 
events of 2024
Most of the network broadly in line with expectations and Logistics Boost projects on track 
Mediterranean focus areas progressed less than expected in Q2
2025 EBIT outlook updated to DKK 0.8-1.0bn from around DKK 1.0bn
2025 Adjusted free cash flow outlook unchanged DKK 1.0bn
 
As outlined earlier this year, 2025 is a transitional year for DFDS where the foundation is laid for improving financial performance following events of 2024.
 
The Q2 2025 financial performance of most of the network was broadly in line with expectations for the quarter.
 
Our key earnings challenge in 2025 is linked to resolving three specific focus areas:
 
Adapting Mediterranean ferry operations to competitive environment change
Turning Logistics’ Türkiye & Europe South around to breakeven by year-end 2025
Delivering on the Logistics Boost turnaround projects initiated in 2024.
 
The realised and expected delivery on the Logistics Boost projects is on track and in line with the expectations for 2025 set earlier this year.
 
The adaptation of the Mediterranean business unit progressed in Q2 2025 but less than expected. Volumes were to a large extent intact but the impact from pricing initiatives fell short of expectations. Further actions have been launched to improve the effectiveness of the yield recovery in the remainder of the year.
 
The Türkiye & Europe South turnaround progressed well in Q2 2025 with regard to rightsizing of the network while volumes and margins were below target, partly due to Turkish transport market dynamics. Achieving the breakeven target in 2025 may therefore be delayed.
 
To reflect the challenges facing two of the focus areas, the EBIT outlook for 2025 is updated to a range of DKK 0.8-1.0bn from previously an EBIT of around DKK 1.0bn.
 
The Q2 cash flow generation was on track and financial leverage is set to improve as expected in H2. The 2025 outlook for Adjusted free cash flow is unchanged DKK 1.0bn.
 
DFDS’ Q2 2025 interim report is scheduled for release on 20 August 2025 at around 7.30am CET.

 MASH","











 
















 
Bagsværd, Denmark, 15 August 2025 
– Novo Nordisk today announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an additional indication for Wegovy
®
 (semaglutide 2.4 mg) based on a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for treatment of noncirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in adults with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis), in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity.
 
The accelerated approval is based on part 1 of the ESSENCE trial, in which Wegovy
®
 demonstrated a statistically significant and superior improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis, as well as resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to placebo.
 
The clinical data from ESSENCE showed that at week 72, 36.8% of people treated with Wegovy
®
 achieved improvement in liver fibrosis with no worsening of steatohepatitis compared to 22.4% treated with placebo. 62.9% of people treated with Wegovy
®
 achieved resolution of steatohepatitis with no worsening of liver fibrosis compared to 34.3% treated with placebo.
 
“Wegovy
®
 is now uniquely positioned as the first and only GLP-1 treatment approved for MASH, complementing the already proven weight loss, cardiovascular benefits and extensive body of evidence linked to semaglutide,” said Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president, chief scientific officer and head of Research and Development, at Novo Nordisk. “MASH represents a significant health burden, with one in three people with overweight or obesity worldwide affected. In the US alone, around 22 million people are estimated to live with MASH. With the approval of Wegovy
®
 for MASH, we provide a new treatment to people living with MASH that not only halts the disease activity but helps reverse the damage caused to the liver.”
 
As of today, Wegovy
®
 is available in the US for the treatment for MASH.
 
About MASH 
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a serious, progressive, metabolic disease affecting the liver, which can be fatal if not properly managed. More than 250 million people live with MASH and the number of individuals in advanced stages of the disease is expected to double by 2030. Of those who are currently overweight or living with obesity, more than one in three are also living with MASH. People living with MASH often experience few or no specific symptoms in the early stages of the disease, which often results in delayed diagnosis. The risk of progression to advanced liver disease, including liver cancer, is higher in people living with MASH than in the general population.
 
About the ESSENCE trial 
ESSENCE is a phase 3 trial evaluating the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (stage 2 or 3). ESSENCE is a two-part trial where 1,200 planned participants were randomised 2:1 to receive semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo, on top of standard of care for 240 weeks. In part 1, the objective was to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg improves liver histology at 72 weeks based on biopsy sampling from the first 800 randomised patients. In part 2, the objective is to demonstrate that treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg lowers the risk of liver-related clinical events compared to placebo in adults with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis at 240 weeks.
 
Based on part 1 of the ESSENCE trial, Novo Nordisk has also filed for regulatory approval in the EU in February 2025, with a subsequent filing in Japan in May 2025. Part 2 of the ESSENCE trial is expected to read out in 2029.
 
About Wegovy
®
 (semaglutide 2.4 mg) 
The FDA initially approved Wegovy
®
 in 2021 with a reduced calorie meal plan and increased physical activity to help adults with obesity, or adults with excess weight (overweight) who also have weight-related medical problems to lose weight and keep the weight off. The indication was expanded in 2022 to include children aged 12 years and older with obesity. In 2024, Wegovy
®
 was approved to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with known heart disease and either obesity or overweight. Today, the FDA granted accelerated approval for Wegovy
®
 for a new patient population for the treatment of MASH in adults with moderate to advanced liver scarring (fibrosis), but not with cirrhosis of the liver.

Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains statements and information which constitute ""forward-looking statements"" or ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable securities legislation). Such statements and information (together, ""forward-looking statements"") relate to future events, including the Corporation’s future performance, business prospects or opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable laws.
 
All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, forecasts, guidance, budgets, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as ""seek"", ""anticipate"", ""plan"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""may"", ""will"", ""project"", “forecast”, ""predict"", ""potential"", ""targeting"", ""intend"", ""could"", ""might"", ""should"", ""believe"", ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: the ability and willingness of IPC to continue the NCIB, including the number of common shares to be acquired and cancelled and the timing of such purchases and cancellations; and the return of value to IPC’s shareholders as a result of any common share repurchases.
 
The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the potential impact of tariffs implemented in 2025 by the U.S. and Canadian governments and that other than the tariffs that have been implemented, neither the U.S. nor Canada (i) increases the rate or scope of such tariffs, or imposes new tariffs, on the import of goods from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and/or (ii) imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas; prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; our ability to maintain our existing credit ratings; our ability to achieve our performance targets; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions and that we will be able to implement our standards, controls, procedures and policies in respect of any acquisitions and realize the expected synergies on the anticipated timeline or at all; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; our intention to complete share repurchases under our normal course issuer bid program, including the funding of such share repurchases, existing and future market conditions, including with respect to the price of our common shares, and compliance with respect to applicable limitations under securities laws and regulations and stock exchange policies; and the ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.
 
Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks.
 
These include, but are not limited to: general global economic, market and business conditions; the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves, resources, production, revenues, costs and expenses; health, safety and environmental risks; commodity price fluctuations; interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; marketing and transportation; loss of markets; environmental and climate-related risks; competition; innovation and cybersecurity risks related to our systems, including our costs of addressing or mitigating such risks; the ability to attract, engage and retain skilled employees; incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions; failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions; the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources; failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; geopolitical conflicts, including the war between Ukraine and Russia and the conflict in the Middle East, and their potential impact on, among other things, global market conditions; political or economic developments, including, without limitation, the risk that (i) one or both of the U.S. and Canadian governments increases the rate or scope of tariffs implemented in 2025, or imposes new tariffs on the import of goods from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, (ii) the U.S. and/or Canada imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and (iii) the tariffs imposed by the U.S. on other countries and responses thereto could have a material adverse effect on the Canadian, U.S. and global economies, and by extension the Canadian oil and natural gas industry and the Corporation; and changes in legislation, including but not limited to tax laws, royalties, environmental and abandonment regulations. Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.
 
Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC, or its operations or financial results, are included in IPC’s annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2024 (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"", ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"" and ""Risk Factors""), in the management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 (See ""Risk Factors"", ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" and ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"") and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities, including previous financial reports, management’s discussion and analysis and material change reports, which may be accessed through the SEDAR+ website (www.sedarplus.ca) or IPC’s website (www.international-petroleum.com).

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable laws.

Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to: the ability and willingness of IPC to continue the NCIB, including the number of common shares to be acquired and cancelled and the timing of such purchases and cancellations; and the return of value to IPC’s shareholders as a result of any common share repurchases. The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the potential impact of tariffs implemented in 2025 by the U.S. and Canadian governments and that other than the tariffs that have been implemented, neither the U.S. nor Canada (i) increases the rate or scope of such tariffs, or imposes new tariffs, on the import of goods from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas, and/or (ii) imposes any other form of tax, restriction or prohibition on the import or export of products from one country to the other, including on oil and natural gas; prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; our ability to maintain our existing credit ratings; our ability to achieve our performance targets; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing, location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions and that we will be able to implement our standards, controls, procedures and policies in respect of any acquisitions and realize the expected synergies on the anticipated timeline or at all; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing, labour and services; our intention to complete share repurchases under our normal course issuer bid program, including the funding of such share repurchases, existing and future market conditions, including with respect to the price of our common shares, and compliance with respect to applicable limitations under securities laws and regulations and stock exchange policies; and the ability to market crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully. Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties.

Electrolux brand launches ‘Wash Life Balance’ global ad campaign to celebrate faster, smarter laundry experiences

The latest Electrolux ad campaign, Wash Life Balance, celebrates the delivery of industry leading performance in the care/laundry category, whilst tapping into the values of Sweden.  Specifically highlighting the 900 series washing machine and tumble dryer, the campaign playfully shows how smarter technology means less time needed for chores, and more time available for living. 

 

“Rooted in the understanding that most people want to spend as little time on chores as possible, Wash Life Balance is a stylistic celebration of Swedish values and the human-centric innovation we bring to every product experience,” says Nikos Bartzoulianos, Group Chief Marketing Officer, Electrolux. 

 

“As a global brand founded in Sweden more than 100 years ago, at Electrolux we want to share how the Swedish approach to life can help people strike a rewarding balance. The campaign delivers on a consumer need for a quick wash and in turn, demonstrates the Electrolux purpose to shape living for the better as smart innovation meets intentional living,” he adds. 

 

At the heart of the campaign is a 60 second film, shot by award-winning Swedish director Jesper Ericstam that taps into the idea that Swedes enjoy full, rich lives at their own relaxed pace. Set to a serene track, the film follows a young Swedish couple living life their way. The couple take extreme care whilst carving a canoe from scratch and grinding coffee beans one by one, for their afternoon fika. 

 

The couple’s exquisitely slow lifestyle is contrasted with the swift performance of their washing machine, which washes a full load in just 45 minutes, allowing the couple to complete their laundry faster than their fika (the term for a Swedish coffee and snack). The film ends with a tranquil shot of the couple gliding across a lake in their handmade canoe, a peaceful reward for time well saved. 

 

Wash Life Balance rolls out from August 15 across TVC, digital, social, and retail platforms in Asia, Australia and Europe. The work is designed in a modular format to adapt across various markets. This approach enables region-specific messaging, from product benefits to lifestyle storytelling, without compromising creative integrity.

 

The campaign follows the recent ’Tough Being Beautiful’ launch, continuing the distinctive creative platform that Electrolux have created with Publicis London to show its connection to and learning from the values of a nation globally recognised as a leader* when it comes to happiness and life satisfaction.

 

Noel Bunting, Chief Creative Officer, Publicis London, said: “If we can inspire the world, together with Electrolux, to embrace that ‘wash life balance’ and help people live a slower, more Swedish lifestyle, then that’s the power of international creativity and human-centric product innovation working in perfect harmony.” 

 

Watch the film here.

2025-08-18,Fastighets AB Balder,Balder’s board appoints Sharam Rahi as new CEO,"[*] 
Balder’s board appoints Sharam Rahi as new CEO 

Fastighets AB Balder’s largest shareholders, Erik Selin Fastigheter AB, Arvid Svensson Invest AB, have announced their intention to propose to the nomination committee that Erik Selin be elected Executive Chairman at the AGM in 2026. Swedbank Robur and AMF have also expressed their support for the proposal. Sten Duner, Balder’s current chairman, will make himself available as a regular board member ahead of the AGM. Balder’s board has also appointed Sharam Rahi as new CEO. Erik Selin will remain as CEO until the AGM of 2026.

Balder currently enjoys a strong market position, stable growth and a solid organisation, and the change is part of a planned succession and a natural step in Balder’s development. 

Sharam Rahi has been with Balder since its inception 20 years ago, and he has played an integral part in the company’s growth and development, most recently in the role as deputy CEO with responsibility for all Balder’s operations. During his time at Balder, Sharam has also held other leading positions, including the role as CEO of Balder’s Finnish subsidiary SATO. Together with Erik Selin, Sharam has built Balder into what it is today. 

Erik Selin will in his role as Executive Chairman focus on capital allocation, investments and financing activities, as well as the work of board work in the Balder Group and its associated holdings. 

Erik Selin, founder and outgoing CEO: 

“After two decades as CEO of Balder it is the right time to pass on the daily operational responsibilities to Sharam, who has been a key player ever since Balder’s journey began. We have worked closely for more than 25 years and I have the greatest confidence in him, as a leader and as a person. Sharam knows the company better than anyone else, and I am convinced his is the right person to lead Balder going forward. I look forward to continuing contributing to Balder’s further development in my role as Executive Chairman”, says Erik Selin. 

Sten Duner, Balder’s chairman: 

“The board is very pleased to appoint Sharam Rahi as new CEO. He has a solid experience, very strong business acumen, and a deep understanding of Balder’s business and culture. The continuity of Balder’s leadership is very important, and with Sharam as CEO and Erik as Executive Chairman, Balder can continue its strong development for many years to come.” 

Sharam Rahi, Balder’s new CEO: 

“It is an honour to take over the helm from Erik, one of Sweden’s most skilled businessmen, says Sharam Rahi. I have the greatest respect for Erik, and what we have built together thus far. My main task will be to continue creating shareholder value in our core business through acquisitions, property development and our strong property management operations. I look forward to lead and continue developing Balder for the benefit of shareholders, clients and our amazing co-workers.”

The nomination committees full proposal of board members will be submitted in the AGM notice.

Closing of the meeting
RESOLUTION PROPOSAL
Item 7 – Proposal of the board of directors for a resolution on the approval of the transfer of business
The board of directors proposes that the meeting approve the Transfers described below (see definition below).
Background and reasons
Since January 2025, the Company has not made payments of due interest and instalments to the Company's creditors. In order to enable the Company to fulfill the Company's obligations to the Company's creditors, negotiations are currently being conducted regarding the divestment of the business that operates First Hotel Planetstaden in Lund and the business that owns and manages the group's properties (the ""
Transfers
""). The Transfers would result in the divestment of the main business operations currently conducted in the Company.
If the negotiations on the Transfers are successful and approved by the EGM, the board of directors of the Company intends to consider strategic alternatives that may result in (1) the continuation of the existing business following the acquisition of new assets, (2) the acquisition or incorporation into the Company of a new value-creating business through a so-called reverse takeover, or (3) alternatively, the liquidation of the Company. If the Company is liquidated, it is expected that materially what is stated in the proposal to the meeting in item 8 will apply.
If the Transfers are not completed, the Company is expected to go bankrupt.
The Transfers
As the negotiations regarding the Transfers are still ongoing, it is not possible to provide information on the total consideration the Company will receive if the Transfers are completed. However, after the Company has fulfilled its obligations to existing creditors, it is not expected that any significant value will remain in the group if the Transfers are completed. It is the intention of the board of directors that agreements are reached in relation to the Transfers in the near future, but there can be no assurance that this will occur or that the Transfers will be completed.
The board expects that the Transfers can be completed on market terms.
Proposal
The board of directors proposes that the meeting approve the implementation of the Transfers.
Item 8 – Proposal of the board of directors as to whether or not the company shall enter into liquidation
The board of directors of the Company has on August 18, 2025, prepared, and had the Company’s auditor examine, a balance sheet for liquidation purposes pursuant to Chapter 25, Sections 13 and 14, of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). The balance sheet for liquidation purposes shows that the Company’s equity is less than one-half of its registered share capital. As a result thereof, the board of directors is obligated to convene a general meeting (initial meeting for liquidation purposes). If the Company’s equity, by the time of the meeting, does not amount to at least the registered share capital, the meeting shall resolve on whether or not the Company should enter into liquidation. Consequently, the board of directors presents the following proposals.
Primary proposal of the board of directors – continue its operations
The board of directors of the Company has put together an action plan to ensure the restoration of the Company’s equity, which is primarily outlined in the proposal to the shareholders’ meeting under item 7. The plan entails that the Transfers shall be carried out. Thus, the board of directors proposes to the meeting that the Company shall not enter into liquidation and that, instead, the Company shall continue its operations.
A resolution that the Company shall continue its operations means that a new general meeting shall be convened within eight months from the initial meeting for liquidation purposes, to resolve, on the basis of a new balance sheet for liquidation purposes, on whether the Company shall enter into liquidation (second meeting for liquidation purposes). If the Company’s equity, as per the balance sheet for liquidation purposes presented at the second meeting for liquidation purposes, is less than the registered share capital, the Company is obligated to enter into liquidation.
The board of directors’ primary proposal is conditional upon the meeting approving the Transfers.
Secondary proposal of the board of directors – liquidation
Notwithstanding the primary proposal that the Company shall continue its operations, the board of directors is, under the Swedish Companies Act, obligated to prepare and present to the meeting a complete proposal for liquidation. Accordingly, the board of directors proposes, as a secondary proposal, that the meeting resolves that the Company shall enter into liquidation.
The Company’s equity is less than one-half of the registered share capital, as shown by the balance sheet for liquidation purposes prepared by the board of directors as per August 18, 2025.
As a result of the foregoing, the board of directors’ secondary proposal is that the meeting resolve that the Company shall enter into liquidation.
Should the meeting resolve that the Company shall enter into liquidation, such resolution is proposed to become effective as of the date the liquidation is registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office.
It is estimated that distribution of the Company’s remaining assets shall occur, at the earliest, seven months after the Swedish Companies Registration Office having registered the resolution on liquidation.
The proceeds remaining to be distributed to the shareholders are conservatively estimated to be SEK 0 per share.
Considering the present circumstances, the board of directors deems that it is only possible to make a rough estimate of the date for distribution and the remaining capital to be distributed.
INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MEETING
The board of directors and the managing director shall, upon request by any shareholder and where the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the Company, provide information concerning circumstances which may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or the Company’s financial condition.
AVAILABLE DOCUMENTATION
Proxy forms, as well as other documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act, will be available at the Company’s office on Dalbyvägen 38, 224 60 Lund, Sweden and on the Company website, www.hotelfastab.se, not later than two weeks before the meeting. The documents will also be sent free of charge to shareholders who have requested this and provided their postal address. The documents will also be available at the meeting.

Interim report January – June 2025

NET ASSET VALUE AND THE LATOUR SHARE

 * The net asset value at the end of the period was SEK 207 per share compared with SEK 215 per share at the start of the year, which is a decrease of 1.9 per cent adjusted for dividends. The benchmark index (SIXRX) increased by 2.3 per cent. The net asset value at 18 August was SEK 212 per share.1 
 * The total return on the Latour share was -8.1 per cent compared with the SIXRX, which increased 2.3 per cent. 
INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

The second quarter

 * The industrial operations’ order intake increased by 9 per cent to SEK 7,131 m (6,570 m). Adjusted for exchange rate effects, this equates to growth of 3 per cent for comparable entities. 
 * The industrial operations’ net sales increased by 9 per cent to SEK 7,095 m (6,522 m). Adjusted for exchange rate effects, this equates to growth of 2 per cent for comparable entities. 
 * The industrial operations’ adjusted operating profit increased by 4 per cent to SEK 989 m (947 m), which equates to an operating margin of 13.9 (14.5) per cent. 
 * On 3 April, Innovalift acquired the UK company Syntium Lifts and on 4 June, Nord-Lock Group signed an agreement to acquire 75 per cent of the shares in the UK company Energy Bolting Limited. The acquisition was completed on 1 July. 
INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS

January - June

 * The acquisitions of the Turkish company Arkel for Innovalift, the German company Howatherm for Swegon and the German company HDS Group for LSAB within Latour Industries were finalised in the first quarter. In addition, Hultafors Group acquired the Danish company Lyngsøe Rainwear ApS and Swegon acquired the US company American Geothermal. 
 * The industrial operations’ order intake increased by 14 per cent to SEK 14,694 m (12,834 m), which represents a 6 per cent increase for comparable entities adjusted for exchange rate effects. 
 * The industrial operations’ net sales increased by 11 per cent to SEK 13,980 m (12,664 m), which represents a 2 per cent increase for comparable entities adjusted for exchange rate effects.

Comments from the CEO
“The second quarter of the year was marked by continued uncertainty related to trade tariffs and macroeconomic conditions. Despite the challenges, the industrial operations’ order intake developed positively and continued to grow during the quarter, driven by both acquisitions and organic growth. In the markets where we operate, overall demand remains at a relatively healthy level, although it varies across regions and sectors. The uncertainty is, to some extent, influencing customer investment decisions, leading to longer decision-making processes. This is particularly affecting the project-based operations within Swegon, Nord-Lock Group and Caljan. However, we are seeing a mixed picture, with Nord-Lock Group reporting a record high quarter for order intake, Swegon is organically in line with the corresponding quarter last year and Caljan slowing down. Hultafors Group is affected by the generally weaker construction industry in Europe, and is slight lower compared with the same quarter last year. We remain confident that our operations are well-positioned to navigate the current market environment and, as in previous periods, we are fully prepared to respond to shifts in demand. 

During the summer, some clarification has been provided regarding US trade tariffs. However, uncertainty remains around which products and materials are exempt, as well as the outcome of ongoing negotiations with additional countries. In line with the first quarter of the year, we do not see any material economic impact from the tariffs during the second quarter. 11 per cent of the industrial operations’ total sales are in the US. Caljan, Hultafors Group, REAC within Latour Industries and Nord-Lock Group have slightly more trade exposure to the US. We have local production to some extent, but the figures also include exports to the US that will be affected. However, the overall impact is limited. Approximately half of total US sales are imported from Europe, representing 5 per cent of the industrial operations’ total turnover. This includes certain products that have, to date, been exempt from the 15 per cent tariffs. Imports from China account for 3 per cent of the industrial operations’ total turnover and especially affect Hultafors Group, which has so far been hardest hit by the tariffs with lower sales in the US. Caljan has continued to deliver on previously placed orders, but has noted a decline in order intake during the quarter, partly as a consequence of the tariffs. We will try to pass any additional costs incurred because of tariffs to the customer to the extent possible.

During the second quarter, total order intake grew by 9 per cent, 3 per cent of which was organic. Net sales grew by 9 per cent, 2 per cent of which was organic. New acquisitions boosted order intake by 11 per cent and net sales by 12 per cent. By the end of the quarter, the order book had increased to SEK 6,854 m, which ensures a good invoicing trend in the coming quarters. Adjusted operating profit increased to SEK 989 m (947 m) with an operating margin of 13.9 (14.5) per cent. We are maintaining a good cost control, but significant fluctuations in exchange rates are adversely affecting the gross margin in some parts of the operations. Cash flow largely follows the normal seasonal pattern and amounts to SEK 858 m (819 m) for operating activities.

We are continuing to make long-term and forward-looking investments in both new and existing businesses. During the quarter, Hultafors Group invested in increased production capacity in Europe by acquiring an existing fleet of machinery in Latvia. We regularly invest in our factories, in product development and digitalisation and, most importantly, in our employees to bolster future growth. Sustainability continues to be a core priority for us. We believe that being in the forefront is essential for being long-term relevant and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. 

Due to the current uncertainty, acquisition activity was somewhat lower in the second quarter. Latour’s financial strength do allow us to invest despite an economic downturn, but always in a prudent and responsible manner. Two great acquisitions have been made within the wholly-owned operations. One for Innovalift and one for Nord-Lock Group. These acquisitions, together with the five that were made during the first quarter, contribute just over SEK 1.8 billion to annual revenue growth. More information about our acquisitions can be found on page 4.

The stock market was characterised by subdued activity in the first six months of the year. During the period, the net asset value of Latour decreased by 1.9 per cent and the value of our portfolio of listed holdings decreased by 4.2 per cent. By comparison, the benchmark index SIXRX increased by 2.3 per cent. All of our listed holdings have now submitted their Q2 statements and overall, these are good reports given the global situation. The market value of the portfolio of listed holdings has increased again since mid-year, driven by, among others, ASSA ABLOY. This is also reflected in Latour’s net asset value. The share price was SEK 212 when the stock exchange closed yesterday, equating to an increase of 0.7 per cent since the beginning of the year.”

Alfa Laval hosts ESS Innovation Day: Exploring neutron insights for industry

On 19 August 2025, Alfa Laval is hosting ESS Innovation Day 2025 in Lund, Sweden. The gathering brings together research directors from leading companies and universities to explore how industry can practically leverage the new opportunities offered by the international research facility European Spallation Source (ESS), and how neutrons can provide new insights into industrial challenges.

Organized for the fourth consecutive year, ESS Innovation Day is an initiative by the ESS High Level Industrial Forum, an advisory body consisting of leading industrialists. This year’s meeting is part of the research facility’s ongoing efforts to connect academia with the industrial sector. 

“By the end of 2027, ESS will have completed its construction project and launched its scientific program. To ensure readiness for this pivotal milestone and to fully harness the returns on our investment in this world-class research facility, we must intensify our engagement with future users - both within the scientific community and industry. A close and collaborative dialogue is essential to ensuring that ESS’s unparalleled tools deliver the insights into materials needed to maintain European competitiveness and contribute to addressing the major challenges of our time,"" says Helmut Schober, Director General at ESS. 

""At Alfa Laval, we believe that collaboration between industry and academia is key to solving complex challenges. ESS Innovation Day 2025 marks an important step in harnessing neutron science to drive practical, groundbreaking solutions needed to successfully manage the transition across many industry verticals,"" says Julien Gennetier, Vice President, Energy Division at Alfa Laval.

Presentations will focus on practical cases of neutron use by different industrial companies. In addition, there will be a panel discussion – ’How to develop and deliver outstanding R&D teams’ – with Professor Mene Pangalos, former Global Research Director at AstraZeneca, Emma Adlerton, Executive Vice President Group Affairs at Alfa Laval and Laurence Mott, former Global Research Director at Tetra Pak. Laurence Mott was recently appointed as a new member of the ESS High Level Industrial Forum, which also includes Lars Börjesson, Professor, Chalmers University, Håkan Björklund, Ph.D and Chairman Asker Healthcare, Professor Mene Pangalos, former Global Research Director at AstraZeneca, Björn Savén, Chairman Jarla Invest, Maria Strömme, Professor of Nanotechnology Uppsala University and Johan Söderström, Executive Advisor to the CEO Hitachi Energy.

Metsä Board starts installation phase of board machine modernisation at Simpele mill – MetsäBoard Classic FBB renewed to meet growing quality and sustainability demands

Metsä Board Corporation press release 19.08.2025

Metsä Board, a leading European producer of premium fresh fibre paperboards, will begin the installation phase of a major board machine modernisation at its Simpele mill this September as part of a €60 million investment programme. The investment will elevate the quality of the flagship folding boxboard grade MetsäBoard Classic FBB and accelerate the mill’s transition toward fossil-free production.

The renewed MetsäBoard Classic FBB will feature curtain coating technology, resulting in an improved print surface and enhanced visual quality. This innovation enables more consistent print results and sharper details, especially in demanding packaging applications.

Currently, 89% of the energy used in production at the Simpele mill is fossil-free. With the implementation of new technologies, this figure is expected to rise to 98% by the end of 2025, marking a significant milestone in Metsä Board’s journey toward fossil-free production and supporting customers’ increasingly ambitious sustainability goals.

The investment shutdown will last approximately five weeks and includes key installations such as a complete modernisation of the coating section, expansion of the coating kitchen, and commissioning of a new pallet packaging line. “Preparations have progressed excellently throughout the summer. In the coming weeks, over 35 truckloads of equipment will arrive from our main suppliers, and more than 430 professionals will be working on-site,” says Toni Tahvanainen, VP  Simpele mill. The upgraded production line is scheduled to be operational in early October.

MetsäBoard Classic FBB is a benchmark product in high-volume food and healthcare segments, where packaging solutions demand high efficiency, reliability and consistency. “Our goal is to offer brand owners an even more competitive packaging option - both in terms of quality and environmental performance. This is especially critical now, as sustainability targets and regulatory requirements are more stringent than ever,” says Esa Kaikkonen, CEO of Metsä Board.

Press Release
 
Nokia and Netplus deliver advanced IPTV services for enhanced customer experience in India
 
Nokia deploys the latest 400G routing technology and software-defined access network (SDAN) platform to scale high-speed broadband and IPTV services for Netplus across Punjab and other cities.
Nokia deployment delivers improved customer experience, better energy efficiency and flexibility to support evolving needs in business and education.
 
20 August 2025 
 
New Delhi, India – Nokia today announced that Netplus, one of India’s fastest-growing Internet Services Providers (ISPs), has deployed the latest 400G routing technology and software-defined access network (SDAN) platform from Nokia, to scale its high-speed broadband and IPTV services across Punjab and other cities. The deployment enables Netplus to deliver more immersive and flexible services to nearly two million users while ensuring network energy efficiency and long-term scalability.
         
 
 
The rollout positions Netplus to transition subscribers from traditional linear TV to on-demand IPTV services while opening doors for high-bandwidth applications such as e-commerce and digital classrooms. With energy-efficient components across all network layers, the deployment also contributes to lower operating costs and supports sustainable growth. 
 
 
 
With a rapid shift in consumer demand for on-demand video, online gaming and educational services, Indian ISPs are under pressure to upgrade their networks for performance and sustainability. For IP access and aggregation, Netplus is leveraging Nokia’s 7250 Interconnect Routers (IXR) series for broadband aggregation and the 7750 Service Router (SR) for broadband network gateway (BNG) functionality. This is complemented by Nokia’s next generation SDAN-based platform for PON (GPON, XGSPON), integrating Altiplano Access Controller with Lightspan Optical Line Terminal (OLT). Together, these technologies provide a fully converged, future-proof architecture with improved service assurance and investment protection.
 
The new network architecture leverages Altiplano’s SDAN functionality to optimize service performance, providing automated control, diagnostics and orchestration across access networks to help accelerate service rollout.
 
“Consumers today want access to high-speed IPTV and interactive applications across multiple devices and locations. This deployment ensures we deliver an improved customer experience, better energy efficiency and flexibility to support evolving needs in business and education. Our collaboration with Nokia reinforces our commitment to building next-gen digital highways for northern India,” said Arshdeep Singh Mundi, Executive Director at Netplus.
 
“By working with Netplus, we are helping build the foundation for India’s next-generation broadband experience. Our solutions deliver the performance, scalability and automation needed to support data-intensive applications like IPTV. With this deployment, Netplus gains the tools to ensure network reliability, reduce energy costs and evolve toward a future-ready architecture,” said Jivitesh Nayal, Head of Emerging Business for Network Infrastructure at Nokia India.

CEO’s comments
 
As outlined earlier this year, 2025 is a transitional year for DFDS where we lay the foundation for improving financial performance following events of 2024.
 
The financial performance of most of the network was in line with our expectations for the quarter.
 
Our key earnings challenge in 2025 remains therefore to resolve three specific focus areas:
 
Adapting Mediterranean ferry operations to competitive environment change
Turning Logistics Türkiye & Europe South around to breakeven by year-end 2025
Delivering on Logistics Boost turnaround projects initiated in 2024.
 
The realised and expected delivery on the Logistics Boost projects is in line with the expectations for 2025 set earlier this year.
 
The adaptation of the Mediterranean business unit progressed in Q2 2025 but less than expected. Volumes were to a large extent intact but the impact from pricing initiatives fell short of expectations. Further actions have been launched to improve the effectiveness of the yield recovery in the remainder of the year.
 
The Türkiye & Europe South turnaround progressed well in Q2 2025 with regard to rightsizing of the network while volumes and margins were below target, partly due to Turkish transport market dynamics. Achieving the breakeven target in 2025 may therefore be delayed.
 
Outlook updated
 
To reflect the challenges facing two of the focus areas, the EBIT outlook for 2025 is updated to a range of DKK 0.8-1.0bn from previously an EBIT of around DKK 1.0bn.
 
The Q2 cash flow generation was on track and financial leverage is set to improve as expected in H2. The 2025 outlook for Adjusted free cash flow is unchanged DKK 1.0bn.
 
The outlook is detailed on page 4.
 
Geopolitics drive European nearshoring
 
Towards the end of July 2025, the EU and USA entered into a trade agreement that set a general tariff of 15% on EU exports to USA.
 
The agreement may curb demand for parts of the EU’s export sector which in turn could impact Europe’s economic short-term growth prospects.
 
The agreement seems likely to support Europe’s determination to become more self-reliant and we expect nearshoring to grow trading with manufacturing hubs such as Türkiye and Morocco which will benefit our network.

INVESTOR NEWS no. 26 - 20 August 2025
 
 
Ferry – freight:
 Total volumes in July 2025 of 3.6m lane metres were 3.4% above 2024 and up 1.2% adjusted for route changes. YTD growth rates were 0.3% and -0.9%, respectively.
 
North Sea volumes were above 2024 with a positive development on most routes as well as a volume catch-up following last month’s national strike in Sweden. Mediterranean volumes were above 2024, also adjusted for the new route between Egypt and Italy.
 
Channel volumes were above 2024 driven by the new Jersey routes. Baltic Sea volumes were above 2024 and Strait of Gibraltar volumes were likewise above 2024.
 
For the last twelve months 2025-24, the total transported freight lane metres increased 3.2% to 41.6m from 40.3m in 2024-23. The increase was 2.4% adjusted for route changes.
 
Ferry – passenger:
 The number of passengers in July 2025 was adjusted for route changes* down 2.8% to 719k vs 2024 and the adjusted YTD growth rate was -3.9%. Higher passenger volumes in Baltic Sea and Strait of Gibraltar were offset by lower Channel volumes. The number of cars in July was 0.5% above 2024 adjusted for route changes.
 
For the last twelve months 2025-24, the total number of passengers increased 1.5% to 5.8m compared to 5.8m for 2024-23. The growth rate was -1.0% adjusted for route changes.
 
*Adjusted for sale of Oslo-Frederikshavn-Copenhagen end October 2025, Tarifa-Tanger Ville due to considerable capacity changes ahead of exit from route early July 2025, and addition of Jersey routes from end March 2025.

2025-08-20,FLSmidth,"FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities","











 












COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025
 
FLSmidth & Co. A/S 
20 August 2025
 
Copenhagen, Denmark
 
 
Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report.
 
Highlights in Q2 2025:
 
Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties
Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%
Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024
Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012
Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen
The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025)
Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets
 
FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “
In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.”
 
 
Updated segment reporting
 
As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry.
 
As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders.
 
The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward.
 
 
Results in Q2 2025
 
Commercial performance
 
Service
 order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025.
 
Products
 order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025.
 
PC&V
 order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025.
 
Consolidated
 order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025.
 
 
Financial performance
 
Service
 revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024.
 
Products 
revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024.
 
PC&V
 revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024.
 
Consolidated
 revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets.
 
 
Results in H1 2025
 
Commercial performance
 
Service
 order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables.
 
Products
 order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024.
 
PC&V
 order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions.
 
Consolidated
 order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business.
 
 
Financial performance
 
Service
 revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024.
 
Products
 revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024.
 
PC&V 
revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024.
 
Consolidated
 revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets.
 
 
Other business
 
Divestment of Corporate Headquarters
Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million.
 
Divestment of FLSmidth Cement
Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025.
 
Divestment of Air Pollution Control business
On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog.
 
Changes to Executive Leadership Team
In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership.
 
In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement.
 
 
Financial guidance for the full year 2025
 
The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.

Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft.
 
The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

",unknown,"FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities","COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025. Earnings call details A presentation of the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report is scheduled for Wednesday 20 August 2025 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. During the presentation, Group CEO, Mikko Keto, and Group CFO, Roland M. Andersen, will comment on the report and developments in the Group. The presentation will be followed by a Q&A session.

The rise of ""Speed Laundering"" – Electrolux report reveals convenience reshaping wash and drying habits across Europe

New study reveals surprising trade-offs, knowledge gaps, and opportunities for time-saving solutions to increase clothing life and to help close the gap between good intention and action.

A new report from Electrolux, published today, reveals the growing dominance of ""speed laundering"" in Europe, driven by busy lifestyles, flexible working and a rising demand for convenience. The study exposes how consumers are prioritizing faster laundry cycles, the trade-offs they're willing to make, and the opportunities for innovative solutions that deliver both speed and increased clothing life.

Extending the life of clothing is a highly effective way to reduce the fashion industry's substantial environmental impact. [1] The industry generates more greenhouse gases
than all international flights and shipping combined. [2]  Additionally, Europeans discard about 16kg of textile waste per person annually, with 88% ending up in landfills or being incinerated [3], despite most items still being usable. [4] According to the Electrolux Care Index, published in 2024, consumers who choose shorter cycles and lower temperatures can lengthen the lifespan of their clothes by more than 50%. [5]

The need for speed: laundry in the age of convenience
The report is based on analysis of 22.6m wash cycles and 6m drying cycles in 2024, gleaned from Electrolux connected appliances, and research among over 15,000 adults in 14 European countries. It highlights a clear shift towards faster laundry routines. 

Key findings include the rise of the ""Under an Hour"" Wash: a third (33%) of all washes now take less than an hour, with an additional 25% completing in just 1 to 1.5 hours. Fast drying also follows suit with nearly a quarter (24%) of tumble-drying cycles now completed in under 90 minutes, with almost half (47%) finished in under two hours. There has also been a momentum shift to morning laundry. A majority (54%) of Europeans now prefer laundering before midday, solidifying a trend that began during the 2020 stay-at-home mandates.

The dilemma of delicates and new EU rules 
Modern lifestyles increasingly demand convenience, and consumers want versatile and flexible solutions to care for all wardrobe essentials. Yet, when it comes to tumble drying delicates, consumers report facing a dilemma. They want their clothes to dry quickly but the vast majority worry about damaging certain fabrics such as wool. Over three quarters (76%) of tumble dryer owners reported being very wary of tumble-drying wool, with nearly half (49%) avoiding it altogether. It’s a similar story with other fabrics and items including silk, duvets, down jackets and outdoor wear.

Interestingly, the features that tumble dryer owners want, so that they can dry delicate fabrics, are frequently offered in heat pump dryers. These dryers are currently in the minority amongst those polled. However, from July 2025, the European Union (EU) has updated the Energy Label and ecodesign for tumble dryers to implement stricter energy efficiency standards. Currently, only heat pump tumble dryers meet the new requirements, which is why Electrolux decided to phase out condenser appliances.

Energy efficiency still a driving force
Electrolux has been monitoring consumer attitudes toward energy costs and usage with appliances since 2022. This latest report shows that for over half of Europeans (53%), energy efficiency will be a major influence on their next major appliance purchase. While slightly down from 59% last year, this clearly demonstrates that energy efficiency continues to be a primary consideration when purchasing laundry appliances.

Concerns over energy costs also significantly impact tumble dryer usage. A substantial 43% of tumble dryer owners stated that these concerns prevent them from using their appliance more often. This is further reinforced by the fact that over a quarter (28%) have actively changed their drying habits in the past twelve months due to energy costs.

Clothing care: trade-offs and knowledge gap
While speed is a clear priority, the report also reveals potential trade-offs and knowledge gaps which, if filled, could close the gap between good intentions and actions. In research from 2024, 84% of Europeans agreed that they care about looking after their clothes. [6] However, only 25% of respondents are aware of the large impact washing has on clothing’s life. Established last year, the Electrolux Care Index [7] showed clothing, including jeans and t-shirts, can last 50% longer with gentler wash conditions – namely, shorter cycles and lower temperatures.

“It is with great pride that we publish the 5th edition of this important research. Fundamental to our purpose is a deep understanding of consumers and a dedication to solving real-world problems”, says Nikos Bartzoulianos, Group Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Sustainability Europe APMEA at Electrolux Group. “We focus on addressing genuine needs, especially in areas like laundry, where extending the life of clothes and reducing environmental impact are paramount.”

Five tips for consumers
The rise of speed laundering presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are five things Electrolux recommends consumers to consider:

 * If speed is a priority: Look for washing machines and dryers that have cycles that can fit around your day. For example, Electrolux UltraQuick, short programme, available in 800 and 900 series washing machines, delivers complete stain removal even at low temperatures. It effectively removes over 50 common household stains - like ketchup, Bolognese sauce, and gravy - at just 30°C, all in under an hour. [8] 
 * Certain tumble dryers can safely dry delicates: Electrolux was the first brand in the world to have tumble dryers awarded Woolmark Wool Care Green certification from global wool care experts, The Woolmark Company. The certification ensures the highest care for wool, together with lower energy consumption. [9] All of Electrolux’s tumble dryers with the DelicateCare feature are Woolmark certified, but it was the 900 series, launched in 2024, that broke through for the highest honors. 
 * Cost of tumble drying similar to one cappuccino a month: Concerns over energy costs prevent a substantial 43% of tumble dryer owners from using their tumble dryer more often. But tumble drying does not have to be expensive. An 8kg A-class Electrolux heat pump dryer with an ECO cycle has an EU average cost around €0.21 per cycle. [10, 11] Drying 160 loads in one year would therefore have an estimated cost €33.50, which is roughly the price of buying a cappuccino, from a leading coffee chain, once a month. [12] 
 * Space needn’t be an issue: The main reason younger generations and parents of young children don’t have a tumble dryer is because of a lack of space. A solution can be to opt for a washer dryer. For example, the Electrolux 900 PerfectCare® Washer Dryer washes and dries clothes, whatever they are made of. Even delicate silk garments keep their shape. [13]   
 * Intelligent sensors can dry even the thickest garment: Dryers with advanced sensors can adjust drying time for optimal, consistent results especially with thicker garments. Electrolux’s 3DSense technology, for example, available on all 800 UltraCare models and above, scans moisture levels deep within thick garments, like down jackets and duvets, ensuring complete drying while fully restoring their warmth and fluffiness. [14]

About the report - The Truth About Laundry
Electrolux has been producing and sharing The Truth about Laundry since 2021. The findings in this latest study are based on quantitative data collected from 15,953 adults across fourteen European markets. OnePoll, a survey-led market research company – managed the research in collaboration with Electrolux and its partners. The survey was fielded between 30th January to 7th March 2025 with data collected in the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK; 1000 General Population per market, with a boost to 500 Tumble Dryer Owners. While the data is mainly from EU countries, due to the size and scale of the research, and to maintain consistency with previous years, we have applied the findings to Europe. 

The data was weighted for each country to ensure accurate representation by age, marital status, income/social class, ethnicity, and religion. For a statistic of 50% the margin of error for sampling on a sample of 1000 respondents is ±3.1%. For smaller or larger statistics, the margin of error will decrease and falls to 1.9% for a statistic of 10% or 90%. This is based on all countries having 1000 respondents per market. This margin of error is small making the data highly reliable.

Energy efficiency still a driving force Electrolux has been monitoring consumer attitudes toward energy costs and usage with appliances since 2022. This latest report shows that for over half of Europeans (53%), energy efficiency will be a major influence on their next major appliance purchase. While slightly down from 59% last year, this clearly demonstrates that energy efficiency continues to be a primary consideration when purchasing laundry appliances. Concerns over energy costs also significantly impact tumble dryer usage. A substantial 43% of tumble dryer owners stated that these concerns prevent them from using their appliance more often. This is further reinforced by the fact that over a quarter (28%) have actively changed their drying habits in the past twelve months due to energy costs. Clothing care: trade-offs and knowledge gap While speed is a clear priority, the report also reveals potential trade-offs and knowledge gaps which, if filled, could close the gap between good intentions and actions. In research from 2024, 84% of Europeans agreed that they care about looking after their clothes. [6] However, only 25% of respondents are aware of the large impact washing has on clothing’s life. Established last year, the Electrolux Care Index [7] showed clothing, including jeans and t-shirts, can last 50% longer with gentler wash conditions – namely, shorter cycles and lower temperatures. “It is with great pride that we publish the 5th edition of this important research. Fundamental to our purpose is a deep understanding of consumers and a dedication to solving real-world problems”, says Nikos Bartzoulianos, Group Chief Marketing Officer and Head of Sustainability Europe APMEA at Electrolux Group. “We focus on addressing genuine needs, especially in areas like laundry, where extending the life of clothes and reducing environmental impact are paramount.” Five tips for consumers The rise of speed laundering presents both challenges and opportunities. Here are five things Electrolux recommends consumers to consider: * If speed is a priority: Look for washing machines and dryers that have cycles that can fit around your day. For example, Electrolux UltraQuick, short programme, available in 800 and 900 series washing machines, delivers complete stain removal even at low temperatures. It effectively removes over 50 common household stains - like ketchup, Bolognese sauce, and gravy - at just 30°C, all in under an hour. [8] * Certain tumble dryers can safely dry delicates: Electrolux was the first brand in the world to have tumble dryers awarded Woolmark Wool Care Green certification from global wool care experts, The Woolmark Company. The certification ensures the highest care for wool, together with lower energy consumption. [9] All of Electrolux’s tumble dryers with the DelicateCare feature are Woolmark certified, but it was the 900 series, launched in 2024, that broke through for the highest honors. * Cost of tumble drying similar to one cappuccino a month: Concerns over energy costs prevent a substantial 43% of tumble dryer owners from using their tumble dryer more often. But tumble drying does not have to be expensive. An 8kg A-class Electrolux heat pump dryer with an ECO cycle has an EU average cost around €0.21 per cycle. [10, 11] Drying 160 loads in one year would therefore have an estimated cost €33.50, which is roughly the price of buying a cappuccino, from a leading coffee chain, once a month. [12] * Space needn’t be an issue: The main reason younger generations and parents of young children don’t have a tumble dryer is because of a lack of space. A solution can be to opt for a washer dryer. For example, the Electrolux 900 PerfectCare® Washer Dryer washes and dries clothes, whatever they are made of. Even delicate silk garments keep their shape. [13] * Intelligent sensors can dry even the thickest garment: Dryers with advanced sensors can adjust drying time for optimal, consistent results especially with thicker garments. Electrolux’s 3DSense technology, for example, available on all 800 UltraCare models and above, scans moisture levels deep within thick garments, like down jackets and duvets, ensuring complete drying while fully restoring their warmth and fluffiness.

Electrolux Group is placed 32 out of 600 European companies that made the list and is the highest-ranked appliance manufacturer. About the report - The Truth About Laundry Electrolux has been producing and sharing The Truth about Laundry since 2021. The findings in this latest study are based on quantitative data collected from 15,953 adults across fourteen European markets. OnePoll, a survey-led market research company – managed the research in collaboration with Electrolux and its partners. The survey was fielded between 30th January to 7th March 2025 with data collected in the following countries: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK; 1000 General Population per market, with a boost to 500 Tumble Dryer Owners. While the data is mainly from EU countries, due to the size and scale of the research, and to maintain consistency with previous years, we have applied the findings to Europe. The data was weighted for each country to ensure accurate representation by age, marital status, income/social class, ethnicity, and religion. For a statistic of 50% the margin of error for sampling on a sample of 1000 respondents is ±3.1%. For smaller or larger statistics, the margin of error will decrease and falls to 1.9% for a statistic of 10% or 90%. This is based on all countries having 1000 respondents per market. This margin of error is small making the data highly reliable.

Proposed Agenda

Establishment and approval of the voting list


Approval of the agenda


Election of one or two persons to verify the minutes


Determination whether the EGM has been duly convened


Resolution regarding approval of divestment of the Company's Public Sector business area 


Closing of the EGM 




Election of Chairperson of the EGM (item 1)


The Company’s Chairperson of the Board, Annikki Schaeferdiek, is proposed as Chairperson of the EGM.


Resolution regarding approval of divestment of the Company's Public Sector business area (item 6)


The board of directors of the Company (the “
Board
”) proposes that the EGM resolves to approve the sale of the Company’s Public Sector business area to a holding company of STG (“
STG
” or the “
Purchaser
”) in accordance with the below. 


On 18 August 2025 the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement with STG relating to the sale of the Company’s Public Sector business area (the “
Transaction
”). The Transaction includes all assets of the Public Sector business area (collectively, “
Formpipe Public
”), and is effected through a sale of the newly established subsidiary Formpipe Sverige AB, to which Formpipe Public will be transferred prior to completion of the Transaction.


Founded in 2004, the Company is a prominent case and document management software provider catering to both the public and private sector through Formpipe Public and the Lasernet business area (“
Lasernet
”), respectively. Formpipe Public and Lasernet have, over time, grown and evolved into two separate units that now are mature enough to continue to develop stand-alone. Over the past few years, the Board has evaluated several different strategic options for the development of the Company, Formpipe Public and Lasernet. The Board has discussed with a handful of potential suitors for Formpipe Public, and, after careful consideration, concluded that the proposed divestment of Formpipe Public to STG is in the best interest of the Company, the Company’s shareholders, and Formpipe Public. The Transaction enables increased focus on Lasernet to maximise long-term shareholder value creation, as well as allowing for distribution of a substantial portion of the proceeds from the Transaction.


The purchase price for Formpipe Public is up to SEK 850 million on a cash free and debt free basis. At closing, SEK 775 million will be paid in cash (subject to net debt and working capital adjustments) and SEK 50 million will be paid through the issuance of a loan note payable in 2029 with a compounding interest of 4.25% per annum and subject to certain potential deductions based on certain metrics related to the separation process. The Purchaser has also undertaken to pay an additional purchase price of SEK 25 million if STG achieves a certain return on its investment.


Completion of the Transaction is conditional upon receipt of necessary clearances or approvals from relevant authorities under the foreign direct investment regimes in Sweden and Denmark, approval by the Company’s shareholders at the EGM, 
90% of the contracted revenue stemming from Formpipe Public’s customers in Sweden agree to be transferred to Formpipe Sverige AB,
 and the completion of necessary separation steps. Closing of the Transaction is expected to take place in Q4 2025, subject to the timing of the regulatory clearances or approvals. 


Following completion of the Transaction, the Company will focus entirely on its retained Lasernet business area, a leading enterprise document and customer communication software platform. The platform is currently used by thousands of customers in several geographies, and the software is sold through a global partner network. The platform is primarily delivered as SaaS, which provides a high share of recurring revenue.


For further information about the Transaction, please see the press release announced on 18 August 2025 and available at the Company’s website 
www.formpipe.com
. 


Other


Shareholders may request that the Board and the CEO provides information about conditions that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda for the EGM. The Board and the CEO shall provide such information at the EGM if it can be done without material injury to the Company.

Formpipe Public and Lasernet have, over time, grown and evolved into two separate units that now are mature enough to continue to develop stand-alone. Over the past few years, the Board has evaluated several different strategic options for the development of the Company, Formpipe Public and Lasernet. The Board has discussed with a handful of potential suitors for Formpipe Public, and, after careful consideration, concluded that the proposed divestment of Formpipe Public to STG is in the best interest of the Company, the Company’s shareholders, and Formpipe Public. The Transaction enables increased focus on Lasernet to maximise long-term shareholder value creation, as well as allowing for distribution of a substantial portion of the proceeds from the Transaction. The purchase price for Formpipe Public is up to SEK 850 million on a cash free and debt free basis. At closing, SEK 775 million will be paid in cash (subject to net debt and working capital adjustments) and SEK 50 million will be paid through the issuance of a loan note payable in 2029 with a compounding interest of 4.25% per annum and subject to certain potential deductions based on certain metrics related to the separation process. The Purchaser has also undertaken to pay an additional purchase price of SEK 25 million if STG achieves a certain return on its investment. Completion of the Transaction is conditional upon receipt of necessary clearances or approvals from relevant authorities under the foreign direct investment regimes in Sweden and Denmark, approval by the Company’s shareholders at the EGM, 90% of the contracted revenue stemming from Formpipe Public’s customers in Sweden agree to be transferred to Formpipe Sverige AB, and the completion of necessary separation steps. Closing of the Transaction is expected to take place in Q4 2025, subject to the timing of the regulatory clearances or approvals. Following completion of the Transaction, the Company will focus entirely on its retained Lasernet business area, a leading enterprise document and customer communication software platform. The platform is currently used by thousands of customers in several geographies, and the software is sold through a global partner network. The platform is primarily delivered as SaaS, which provides a high share of recurring revenue. For further information about the Transaction, please see the press release announced on 18 August 2025 and available at the Company’s website . Other Shareholders may request that the Board and the CEO provides information about conditions that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda for the EGM. The Board and the CEO shall provide such information at the EGM if it can be done without material injury to the Company. Documents in accordance with the Companies Act will be made available at the Company's office, Sveavägen 168 in Stockholm, and on the Company website at the latest from Wednesday, 27 August 2025.

2025-08-20,Novo Nordisk,"Novo Nordisk to present Wegovy® and Ozempic® data showing
 life-saving cardiovascular benefits for people living with obesity and type
 2 diabetes at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2025","











 
















 
Data to highlight the impact of Wegovy
®
 (semaglutide 2.4 mg) on atrial fibrillation – a common heart rhythm condition – in people living with obesity (SELECT study)
Additional Rybelsus
®
 and Ozempic
®
 data demonstrate new cardiometabolic benefits (improvements in heart and metabolic health) in people living with type 2 diabetes (SOUL and STRIDE studies)
New insights into the role of inflammation in cardiovascular disease on mortality and major cardiovascular events in people living with inflammation in the heart vessels 
 
Bagsværd, Denmark, 20 August 2025
 – Novo Nordisk today announced new data showing the cardiovascular protective benefits of Wegovy
®
 and Ozempic
®
 will be presented at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2025 from 29 August to 1 September in Madrid, Spain. New data will also include perspectives on the role of inflammation in a condition called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
 
“For people living with diabetes and obesity, heart disease is one of the biggest threats that could change a person’s life in an instant. Semaglutide is proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 20-26%
1
, meaning fewer hospitalisations, heart attacks, stroke and deaths,” said Ludovic Helfgott, executive vice president and head of Product & Portfolio Strategy at Novo Nordisk.
 
The key role of cardiovascular inflammation in ASCVD will be discussed in a Novo Nordisk symposium on Saturday, 30 August. ASCVD is a condition where blood vessels that carry blood to your heart cut off the blood flow to other parts of your body, making those vessels stiff and narrow. Additionally, a range of real-world evidence is being presented, providing a thorough analysis of the impact of inflammation in cardiovascular disease on mortality and major cardiovascular events in people with ASCVD. Real-world evidence is data from everyday healthcare settings that show how treatments work in real life, beyond controlled clinical trials.
 
“At the ESC congress, we are presenting new data substantiating the unique range of benefits semaglutide has on people with heart and kidney disease, as demonstrated in both clinical trials and in the real world,” Ludovic Helfgott said. “Semaglutide is unrivalled in the GLP-1 class with its proven reduction in heart attack, stroke, kidney complications and cardiovascular death.”

Outlook for Kojamo in 2025

Kojamo restates its outlook from stock exchange release published on July 31, 2025. The outlook update was due to the sale of a residential portfolio, as the outlook does not take into account the impact of potential acquisitions and disposals on revenue or on cash flow before changes in working capital (FFO).

Kojamo estimates that in 2025, the Group’s total revenue will increase by 0–2 per cent year-on-year. In addition, Kojamo estimates that the Group’s FFO for 2025 will amount to between EUR 135–141 million, excluding non-recurring costs.

The outlook is based on the management’s assessment of total revenue, property maintenance expenses and repairs, administrative expenses, financial expenses and taxes to be paid as well as the management’s view on future developments in the operating environment.

The outlook takes into account the estimated occupancy rate and development of rents. The total revenue and FFO outlook also takes into account the impacts of disposal of the 44 residential properties, but it does not take into account the impact of potential future acquisitions or disposals. The outlook does not take into account the taxes resulting from the transaction.

The management can influence total revenue and FFO through the company’s business operations. In contrast, the management has no influence over market trends, the regulatory environment or the competitive landscape.

CEO’s review 

The growth in total revenue and net rental income continued in the second quarter of the year. FFO decreased which was due to higher financial, maintenance and repair expenses than in comparison period. Our balance sheet has remained strong.

Improving the occupancy rate is still our key priority, and robust growth continued during the second quarter. Our financial occupancy rate was 92.8 per cent in the first quarter, and it increased to 94.4 per cent in the second quarter. In June, our occupancy rate already reached 94.8 per cent.

There is still oversupply in the rental market, particularly in the capital region. New construction is not expected to increase supply in the near term, as the volume of residential development in Finland has remained at a low level. Although construction companies have started some projects for owner-occupied housing, construction is not anticipated to resume on a broad scale. Based on listings on housing portals, the number of available rental apartments has not yet decreased significantly, but the growth in supply appears to have stalled.

Our commitment to customer experience is delivering results. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) reached an all-time high of 58 at the end of June. Customer turnover has also developed positively, declining from the previous year.

In June, we signed an agreement to sell a total of 1,944 apartments. The transaction was completed after the review period, at the end of July. The 44 properties being sold are located in eight different municipalities, mainly outside the capital region. As we are strongly focused on Finland’s growth centres, these properties were not aligned with our strategy. The sale of this housing portfolio is in line with our targets for the current year and is, so far, the largest transaction in the Finnish residential market this year. The proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt and for share buybacks, which will strengthen our balance sheet and support the creation of shareholder value.

Our financing position is very good. In June, we refinanced a EUR 100 million bank loan with Swedbank maturing next year, thereby extending the maturity profile of our loans. The average interest rate of financing decreased from the end of March. In addition, after the review period in August, we refinanced a EUR 100 million bank loan maturing in 2026 with OP. Our next financing arrangements will focus on loans maturing in 2027.

I had the honour of starting as CEO of Kojamo at the beginning of June. I am grateful to everyone at Kojamo for the warm welcome I have received in many different encounters. Kojamo is a strong company – both in terms of its balance sheet and expertise – and it is well positioned to be a forerunner in housing and the number one choice for customers, in line with its vision. Our goal is to create an even better customer experience, with a focus on growth centres.

Press Release
Nokia and INX-ZA future-proof internet connectivity for South Africa’s digital communities
 
End users gain access to high-capacity, high-availability internet exchange services
INX-ZA unlocks 400GE-ready peering infrastructure, enhancing service reach and performance
Nokia's IP networking solution supports scalable, next-generation internet exchange architecture
 
21 August 2025
Johannesburg, South Africa – Nokia has been selected by INX-ZA, the Internet Exchange Point division of the Internet Service Provider Association (ISPA), to modernize its exchange infrastructure. INX-ZA will deploy Nokia’s high performance IP routing portfolio to offer new 400GE and expanded 100GE services to its customers across the country. As a result, businesses and internet users can now experience faster, more resilient, and future-ready Internet connectivity in South Africa.
 
 
 
Internet exchanges are a critical component of the digital ecosystem, enabling data to be exchanged locally and reducing dependency on expensive international bandwidth. Yet many IXPs across Africa still operate on aging platforms that lack scalability and efficiency. INX-ZA’s shift to Nokia’s solution addresses these limitations head-on, opening the door to more energy-efficient, scalable and high-density infrastructure that can evolve alongside the region’s digital ambitions.
 
 
 
Nokia will upgrade INX-ZA’s Internet Exchange Points in Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, beginning with Johannesburg – home to JINX, Africa’s oldest Internet Exchange Point, which has achieved 100% uptime since its launch in 1996. Together, Nokia and INX-ZA will expand JINX from seven to ten data centers by year-end, deploying thirty high-performance platforms in phase one to preserve its industry-leading availability while extending its reach.
 
 
 
The deployment, powered by Nokia’s high-capacity 7250 Interconnect Routers and Service Router Operating System (SR OS), enables INX-ZA to offer new 400GE and expanded 100GE services for peering partners and Internet service providers (ISPs) – a capability not previously available in the region. In addition, it will augment the scale and performance of INX-ZA’s backbone to connect to different points of presence (POPs) with 400GE links. 
 
 
 
This initiative lays the foundation for similar transformations across the continent’s legacy exchange points. It is a major step towards more efficient, flexible, and high-performance network infrastructure for South African ISPs, cloud providers, and enterprises.
 
 
 
“Upgrading to Nokia’s 400GE-ready infrastructure isn’t just about adding capacity – it’s about reimagining how South Africa connects. With this modern, energy-efficient platform, INX-ZA can deliver faster, more reliable, and more sustainable interconnection services while maintaining the uptime and performance our community has come to expect of us. Nokia’s technology gives us the scale and capability to keep our exchanges at the forefront of global standards and power the country’s digital economy for the future,” said Nishal Goburdhan, INX-ZA’s General Manager.
 
 
 
“As people are consuming and producing more content and businesses are moving their loads to the cloud, Internet Exchanges are an essential and critical part of digital infrastructure. Working with customers like INX-ZA, which is deeply committed to technical excellence and community enablement, is aligning to our belief in delivering resilient, sustainable and scalable trusted infrastructure in South Africa. Our platforms offer the flexibility and openness needed to meet today’s interconnection demands while paving the way for future innovation with SR Linux and automation,” said Toni Pellegrino, Head of South and East Africa Sales Unit, Network Infrastructure, Nokia.

Half-year Report January – June 2025

 

 

 * Rent revenue from property management was SEK 1,226 million (1,147), an increase of 7 per cent. 
 

 * The Group’s gross profit increased by 8 per cent, totalling SEK 803 million (744). 
 

 * The fair value of the property holdings was SEK 47.4 billion (47.1 at year-end).

 * Net result for the period was SEK 264 million (-354). 
 

 

Comments from Hufvudstaden’s President, Anders Nygren. 

”Hufvudstaden presents improved earnings for the first half of the year, with gross profit up 8 per cent. This shows that our business concept is successful, even in times of global challenges and market uncertainty.

 

Toward the end of the second quarter, activity in the office rental market increased slightly, and we signed leases with Visa in the NK building in Stockholm and Nordea in Kvarteret Johanna in Gothenburg. Our major redevelopment project in Stockholm, The Corner, is attracting interest and intense rental dialogues are ongoing.

In early summer, we started to see a recovery in the retail sector, with increased consumption among consumers, although some retailers are continuing to face profitability challenges. The vacancy rates among our street-level retail premises are low, and we signed leases with New Balance and House of Dagmar, for example, during the second quarter.”

INTERIM REPORT FOR Q3 2024/25







                                        22.8.2025 07:00:01 CEST
                                        | Ambu A/S
                                        | Interim report (Q1 and Q3)
                                    
























In the third quarter of the 2024/25 financial year, Ambu delivered 12.0% organic revenue growth and an 11.3% EBIT margin before special items. This was driven by continued growth in Endoscopy Solutions, which grew 15.9%, and solid performance in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, which grew 6.4%. This brings the organic growth for the first nine months to 14.3% and the EBIT margin to 13.9%.


The financial guidance for organic revenue growth for 2024/25 is updated to reflect the continued solid growth and is now expected to be 12-14% (previously 11-14%).


“I am pleased with the continued solid growth momentum in our third quarter. With 15.9% growth in Endoscopy Solutions and portfolio expansions in pulmonology and urology, we are deepening our presence in high-growth markets. On the back of solid revenue performance in Endoscopy Solutions and strong growth in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, we are raising the lower end of our organic revenue guidance to 12-14% for the full year. We maintain our EBIT margin guidance, supported by solid organic growth and operational leverage, even as we navigate FX and tariff-related dynamics.


I want to thank our teams for their dedication and execution, which makes this continued progress possible. We look forward to welcoming institutional investors, analysts, and financial media to attend our Capital Markets Day on 1 October 2025, where we will share insights on strategy and market opportunities.”

Q3 HIGHLIGHTS


Business highlights




Advancing pulmonology market leadership position
 with the expansion of Ambu® SureSight™ Connect video laryngoscopy solution for pediatric patients.


Strengthened urology offering
 with FDA clearance for Ambu® aScope™ 5 Cysto HD cysto-nephroscope for PCNL procedures.


Continued sustainability leadership
 with launch of first-of-its-kind endoscope tack-back and recycling program, the Ambu® Recircle Program, in key markets.


Scott Heinzelman appointed new President for North America
 and member of Ambu’s Executive Leadership Team, as of 25 August.




Financial highlights




Revenue 
increased organically by 12.0% (15.0%) to DKK 1,507m (DKK 1,383m), with reported growth of 9.0% (15.7%). Organic growth for the first nine months was 14.3% (14.9%), with reported growth of 14.2% (12.9%). 
Endoscopy Solutions
 increased organically by 15.9% (18.0%). The 
Pulmonology 
business group posted 11.2% (9.9%) organic growth, positively impacted by continued aScope™ 5 Broncho adoption, as well as the newly launched video laryngoscopy solution. The 
Urology, ENT, & GI 
business group posted 20.8% (27.6%) organic growth, mainly driven by the aScope™ 4 portfolio, with sustained strong growth momentum for aScope™ 5 Uretero.


Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring
 increased organically by 6.4% (10.9%) and by 11.1% (6.4%) for the first nine months, driven by both volume and price increases.


EBIT before special items (b.s.i.)
 was DKK 170m (DKK 178m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 11.3% (12.9%). EBIT b.s.i. for the first nine months ended at DKK 637m (DKK 498m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 13.9% (12.4%). EBIT margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs but positively impacted by continued operational leverage from solid organic growth.


Free cash flow (FCF)
 before acquisitions totaled DKK 128m (DKK 163m), leaving FCF for the first nine months to DKK 277m. This was impacted by continued higher net working capital to mitigate the global geopolitical uncertainties and support growth, and profitability was impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs. As a result, FCF assumptions for FY 2024/25 are now DKK ~400m (previously DKK +500m).


Raise of lower end of organic revenue guidance to 12-14%
 (previously 11-14%), driven by continued procedure growth and conversion towards single-use solutions. EBIT margin b.s.i. guidance is maintained, with investments continuing as planned to support long-term growth, despite FX headwind and increased tariff costs. 
2024/25 financial guidance:




Organic revenue growth
: 12-14% (previously 11-14%)


EBIT margin b.s.i.
: 13-15%

Scott Heinzelman














Effective 25 August 2025, Ambu announces the appointment of Scott Heinzelman as President of the North America commercial region. He succeeds Steven Block, who has decided to step down after 12 years of dedicated leadership to begin a new chapter in semi-retirement.


Scott Heinzelman is a seasoned commercial executive with extensive experience in driving strong growth and organizational transformation. He is a US native with more than two decades of experience from the medtech industry, having held senior leadership roles at global healthcare companies, such as Abbott, Orthofix, and Covidien (now Medtronic). Most recently, he served as Divisional Vice President of Abbott Vascular’s US Commercial business, where he led a $1 billion organization, built a specialized sales force, launched breakthrough therapies, and delivered growth that outpaced the market. Prior to that, he held roles as Divisional Vice President of Sales & Marketing and Global Head of Commercial Excellence, with responsibility for commercial strategy, P&L performance, and commercial infrastructure.


Throughout his career, Scott has demonstrated a strong ability to shape commercial strategy, drive sustainable and profitable growth, and lead high-performing sales organizations with a sharp focus on execution across complex business environments. His leadership is characterized by strategic clarity, customer focus, and a collaborative mindset – qualities that have consistently delivered results and earned the trust of customers, colleagues, and partners alike.


“I am very excited to welcome Scott Heinzelman as our new President for Ambu North America. Scott brings a wealth of commercial experience and a proven ability to define and deliver a customer-focused high-growth agenda from leading medtech companies. His strong leadership skills, combined with his strategic and analytical capabilities, makes him a natural choice to lead our continued expansion and to strengthen our leadership position in the North American market. 


Also, I would like to thank Steven for leading our Ambu North America team over the past 12 years. He has played an instrumental role in driving a successful growth agenda and demonstrating strong leadership. I wish him all the best in his next life chapter.”


BRITT MEELBY JENSEN
Chief Executive Officer


Leading the next phase of growth in North America
Over the past decade, Ambu North America has achieved strong growth and is today a leading company in the US endoscopy market as well as a prominent player in the US medtech industry. The organization has an extensive presence in hospitals nationwide and contributes to improving care for millions of patients every year. Steven Block has played a central role in elevating Ambu’s North American business to this impactful position.


With a strong foundation established and Scott Heinzelman appointed as President, Ambu is well-positioned to accelerate its growth ambitions in the North American market. He will join Ambu’s Executive Leadership Team as he takes on the responsibility for leading the next phase of growth and leadership in North America.


“I'm honored to join this incredible organization at such an important time. Ambu has a history of customer-centric innovation and a strong culture; this is a winning formula for delivering strong results. It is a privilege to lead the North America organization into this next stage of high growth and profitability. Our focus is clear: deliver solutions that make a real difference in healthcare and patients’ lives. We’re not just aiming to grow – we’re aiming to lead.”

2025-08-22,Bavarian Nordic A/S,Bavarian Nordic Announces First Half 2025 Results,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark, August 22, 2025 
– Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) announced today its interim financial results and business progress for the first half of 2025 and released its financial calendar for 2026.
 
Revenue for the first half increased by 33% to DKK 2,998 million, reflecting a strong performance in both Travel Health and Public Preparedness.  
Travel Health revenue increased by 24% to DKK 1,386 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by increased demand for rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines.
Public Preparedness revenue increased by 51% to DKK 1,546 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by quarterly phasing of orders.
Other revenue was DKK 66 million.
 
EBITDA was DKK 961 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 32%.
Based on a strong performance in the Travel Health business as well as further clarity on the Public Preparedness business for the remainder of the year, Bavarian Nordic has refined its financial guidance for 2025, which overall remains within the previously announced revenue and EBITDA margin intervals. Full year revenue expectations are narrowed to DKK 6,000-6,600 million, reflecting an upgrade of Travel Health to DKK 2,750 million, which still includes DKK 50-100 million from sale of Vimkunya, and narrowing the Public Preparedness interval to DKK 3,100-3,700 million, with the low end of the interval now secured by contracts. EBITDA margin before special items guidance remains unchanged at 26-30%. When including the net income of DKK 810 million from the recent sale of the Priority Review Voucher, the total EBITDA margin is expected to be 40-42%.

Paul Chaplin, President & Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic
 said: “We are pleased to report a strong first half of 2025, which fully captures our successful commercial transformation over the past years, in line with our growth strategy. Our Travel Health business continues to outperform, delivering 24% revenue growth year-over-year, primarily driven by rabies and TBE vaccines. A major highlight for the period was the launch of our chikungunya vaccine for travelers, which is being introduced in more countries as we continue to expand our commercial footprint across new geographies. With the strong performance combined with recent additional orders for our mpox/smallpox vaccine, we refine our full year guidance to reflect higher revenue from Travel Health and a narrower revenue interval for the Public Preparedness business as we have now secured the lower end of our guidance for this business. Overall, we remain within our guided revenue interval and maintain our expectations to an EBITDA margin before special items of 26-30% in 2025. The recent sale of our Priority Review Voucher has generated a one-off income, strengthening our financial position and contributing to an improved result. Hence, the EBITDA margin including special items is expected to be 40-42% for the full year.”
 
Highlights from the period 
 
Travel Health
 
Vimkunya was approved in the US, EU and in the UK for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in individuals 12 years and older. The vaccine was launched commercially in the US in March, in Germany in May, and in France in June.
Concurrently with the US approval of Vimkunya, Bavarian Nordic was granted a Priority Review Voucher, which was sold for USD 160 million. Upon completion of the sale in July, the Company earned net proceeds of DKK 810 million.
Following the approval of Vimkunya in the US in February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Vimkunya for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus for US persons aged 12 and older traveling to regions with an outbreak or elevated risk of chikungunya, as well as for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to chikungunya virus. Recommendations on the use of the vaccine have since been issued by relevant authorities in France, Germany and in the UK.
 
In June, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Vimkunya in children 2 to 11 years of age was initiated, seeking to expand the target population for the chikungunya vaccine.
 
Public Preparedness
 
The freeze-dried version of JYNNEOS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March for prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older. The approval supports the ongoing contract with the US government for stockpiling of the vaccine. In May, the US government exercised additional options valued at USD 143.6 million under the contract, with the majority planned for delivery in 2026.
In June, investigator-sponsored clinical trials were initiated to support approval of the mpox/smallpox vaccine in vulnerable populations: infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
 
Events after the reporting date
 
In July, Bavarian Nordic entered a contract valued at over DKK 200 million for the supply of smallpox/mpox vaccines to a European country. Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured approximately DKK 3,100 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this business.
In July, Health Canada accepted for review the Company’s application for licensure of the chikungunya vaccine, potentially supporting approval in the first half of 2026.
In July, the sale of the Priority Review Voucher was completed, generating net proceeds of DKK 810 million.
In July, Bavarian Nordic announced that it had entered into an announcement agreement with Innosera ApS, a newly formed company controlled by Nordic Capital Fund XI1 and funds managed and advised by Permira Beteiligungsberatung GmbH, pursuant to which Innosera ApS will make an all-cash recommended voluntary public takeover offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Bavarian Nordic. Innosera ApS is expected to publish its offer document on August 26, 2025, at the latest.

Nordnet’s app receives Red Dot Design Award

Nordnet has been awarded the prestigious Red Dot Design Award. The prize was awarded to Nordnet in the category “Mobile Apps” and the subcategory “Finance.”

The Red Dot Award is one of the world’s largest and most respected design competitions, awarded annually by the German organization Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen. The award was founded in 1955, and the jury consists of 32 international and independent design experts. The jury’s assessment criteria include functionality, aesthetics, degree of innovation and sustainability.

- Red Dot is one of the highest honors in product design, and being given this recognition proves that we have succeeded in creating a truly strong mobile user experience for Nordic savers. We develop our design in close collaboration with customers and aim to offer broad functionality tailored for both new savers and more experienced investors, says Rasmus Järborg, Chief Product Officer and Deputy CEO at Nordnet.

The mobile app is a central part of the user experience at Nordnet, and around 1.5 million of Nordnet’s 2.2 million customers use the app. Mobile is by far the dominant login channel, with 88 percent of all logins taking place via the app. Trading activity continues to grow, and the distribution of trades between the app and the website is currently 55 percent via the app and 45 percent via the website. The most popular features in the app are searching for information on specific stocks or funds, as well as accessing the account overview for a quick view of savings. 66 percent of users have an iPhone, while 21 percent use Samsung.

- Nordnet’s mobile app is under continuous development, and on average we release a new version twice a week. Most recently we have added algorithmic orders, trading on eight new European exchanges, pre-market trading in US stocks and the ability to set individual savings goals, says Rasmus Järborg, Chief Product Officer and Deputy CEO at Nordnet.

Further information about the competition and the award can be found at www.red-dot.org. More information about Nordnet’s mobile app is available at www.nordnet.se/se/tjanster/handelsapplikationer/nordnet-app.

",unknown,Nordnet’s app receives Red Dot Design Award,"[*] Nordnet’s app receives Red Dot Design Award Nordnet has been awarded the prestigious Red Dot Design Award. The prize was awarded to Nordnet in the category “Mobile Apps” and the subcategory “Finance.” The Red Dot Award is one of the world’s largest and most respected design competitions, awarded annually by the German organization Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen. The award was founded in 1955, and the jury consists of 32 international and independent design experts. The jury’s assessment criteria include functionality, aesthetics, degree of innovation and sustainability. - Red Dot is one of the highest honors in product design, and being given this recognition proves that we have succeeded in creating a truly strong mobile user experience for Nordic savers. We develop our design in close collaboration with customers and aim to offer broad functionality tailored for both new savers and more experienced investors, says Rasmus Järborg, Chief Product Officer and Deputy CEO at Nordnet. The mobile app is a central part of the user experience at Nordnet, and around 1.5 million of Nordnet’s 2.2 million customers use the app. Mobile is by far the dominant login channel, with 88 percent of all logins taking place via the app. Trading activity continues to grow, and the distribution of trades between the app and the website is currently 55 percent via the app and 45 percent via the website. The most popular features in the app are searching for information on specific stocks or funds, as well as accessing the account overview for a quick view of savings. 66 percent of users have an iPhone, while 21 percent use Samsung. - Nordnet’s mobile app is under continuous development, and on average we release a new version twice a week. Most recently we have added algorithmic orders, trading on eight new European exchanges, pre-market trading in US stocks and the ability to set individual savings goals, says Rasmus Järborg, Chief Product Officer and Deputy CEO at Nordnet.

Lundbeck to present new data on bexicaserin at upcoming congress, highlighting long-term impact on seizure frequency in patients with rare epilepsy

 * The full results of the open label extension (OLE) of the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC trial investigating bexicaserin for the treatment of patients with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs), will be presented for the first time at the International Epilepsy Annual Congress1 
 * DEEs are the most severe rare epilepsies, characterized by drug-resistant seizures, frequent epileptic activity on EEG and developmental slowing or regression2 
 * Bexicaserin, which has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA, demonstrated reductions in countable and total motor seizure frequency in the extension study comparable to reductions seen in the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC trial, reinforcing durability of response and validating its progression to Phase 3 trials1 
 * Additional data will be presented from the audiogenic seizure model and the GAERS absence epilepsy model, investigating sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and seizure reduction respectively.3,4 

Valby, Denmark, 25 August 2025 – H. Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) today announced that new data regarding bexicaserin, a novel treatment under investigation for seizures associated with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs), will be presented at the 36th International Epilepsy Congress (IEC) in Lisbon, Portugal (Aug 30 – Sept 3).

Bexicaserin is an investigational compound that is not approved for marketing by any regulatory authority worldwide. The efficacy and safety of bexicaserin has not been established. 

“Patients with DEEs represent a challenging group of rare epilepsies, with few effective approved treatment options,” said Johan Luthman, EVP and Head of Research and Development at Lundbeck. “As we are now in phase 3 trials with bexicaserin, we are optimistic about its potential. The clinical data so far suggests broad and durable anti-seizure activity across DEEs, and new preclinical data suggests modulation of the risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). This marks a significant step forward in the potential to transform care for patients and address critical gaps in the treatment landscape,”

The full results of the open label extension (OLE) of the Phase 1b/2a PACIFIC trial will be presented. It was designed to evaluate the long-term (up to 52 weeks), safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bexicaserin in individuals with a DEE. During the OLE, a median reduction of 59.3% in countable motor seizure frequency was observed, with 55% of participants experiencing sustained reductions of ≥50% compared to baseline before the PACIFIC trial. Bexicaserin was well tolerated, with no new safety signals observed.

“I am encouraged by the 100% enrollment of eligible participants and the high completion rate of over 90% in the open-label extension study. Such high retention underscores the tolerability as well as the duration of effect of bexicaserin across developmental and epileptic encephalopathies,” said Ingrid E. Scheffer, lead investigator and Laureate Professor of Pediatric Neurology, The University of Melbourne and Austin Health.

Lundbeck will also showcase preclinical data in an audiogenic seizure model of SUDEP, the most common cause of premature death in children and adults with epilepsy.3,6 Bexicaserin significantly reduced seizures and respiratory arrest in the SUDEP model. Furthermore, preclinical data will be shared indicating the impact of bexicaserin on absence seizures, a type of seizure that is often more difficult to treat.4,7

Bexicaserin has entered late-stage clinical development through the global phase 3 program, DEEp, aimed at evaluating its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in the treatment of seizures in children and adults with DEEs. The DEEpSEA trial8 is currently recruiting participants with Dravet syndrome and the DEEpOCEAN trial9 is open to individuals with DEEs (including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome).  

Both trials are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and open for enrollment across the North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America, with additional sites being activated on a rolling basis.

About Bexicaserin
Bexicaserin (LP352) is an oral, centrally acting 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT2C) receptor superagonist with no engagement of the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes, potentially minimizing the risks of cardiovascular toxicity associated with nonselective serotonergic agents. Bexicaserin is being evaluated in a global Phase 3 clinical program (the DEEp Program). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bexicaserin for the treatment of seizures associated with Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathies (DEEs) for patients two years of age and older. Bexicaserin is an investigational compound that is not approved for marketing by any regulatory authority worldwide.



About the PACIFIC trial
The PACIFIC trial was a Phase 1b/2a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of bexicaserin in 52 participants between the ages of 12 and 65 years old with any type of DEE (Dravet syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and DEE other) at 34 sites across the United States and Australia. Participants who had ≥4 countable motor seizures during the 28-day baseline period, while on a stable regimen of 1 to 4 concomitant antiseizure medications were included.11

Following a 28-d baseline period, study participants initiated a dose titration over a 15-day period and subsequently continued on the highest tolerated dose throughout the maintenance period of 60 days. Eligible participants were given the opportunity to enroll in a 52-week open-label extension if they completed the 75-d RCT treatment period (titration and maintenance). The OLE duration was 52 weeks and included patients with Dravet syndrome (n=3), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n=20) and DEE Other (n=18), who completed the PACIFIC trial (n=41).

2025-08-25,BioArctic,Leqembi® (lecanemab) launched in the EU today,"[*] 
Leqembi® (lecanemab) launched in the EU today

Stockholm, August 25, 2025 – BioArctic AB’s (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) partner Eisai announced today that the launch of Leqembi in the EU started in Austria on August 25, 2025, and will be launched in Germany on September 1, 2025. Leqembi received the European Commission (EC) approval in April 2025 as the first therapy that targets an underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to AD (early AD) who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4[1]) non-carriers or heterozygotes with confirmed amyloid pathology.[i] Germany and Austria will mark the first launches in the EU.

Following the EC approval, Eisai has been collaborating with the regional and local healthcare authorities to implement the mandatory authorisation requirements ahead of launch. The required controlled access program[2] is now in place in Austria and Germany, enabling the launch in these first two EU countries. 

Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks. It progresses in stages that increase in severity over time, and each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease from its early stage and reduce the overall burden on people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and society. Only Leqembi fights Alzheimer’s disease in two ways - targeting both amyloid plaque and protofibrils[3], which can impact tau accumulation downstream. 

In the Clarity AD clinical trial, the primary endpoint was the global cognitive and functional scale, Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).i Treatment with lecanemab (n=757), in the EU indicated population (ApoE ε4 non-carriers or heterozygotes, measured by controlled-based multiple imputation[4]), reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB by 31% at 18 months compared to placebo (n=764).i

In the EU indicated population (ApoE ε4 non-carriers or heterozygotes) (n=757), the most common adverse reactions were infusion-related reaction (26%), ARIA-H (13%), headache (11%) and ARIA-E (9%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 2% of participants. Symptomatic ARIA-H occurred in 0.8% of patients.i

Leqembi is the result of a long-standing collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai, and the antibody was originally developed by BioArctic based on the work of Professor Lars Lannfelt and his discovery of the Arctic mutation in Alzheimer’s disease. Eisai is responsible for the clinical development, applications for market approval and commercialization of Leqembi for Alzheimer’s disease. BioArctic has the right to commercialize Leqembi in the Nordic region together with Eisai and the two companies are preparing for a joint commercialization in the region.

About lecanemab (Leqembi®)
Lecanemab is the result of a strategic research alliance between BioArctic and Eisai. It is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble (protofibril) and insoluble forms of amyloid-beta (Aβ).i,[ii] 

Lecanemab is approved in the U.S., Japan, EU, China, Great Britain, and several other markets for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild AD dementia. Lecanemab’s approvals in these countries, as well as the EC’s market authorization, were primarily based on Phase 3 data from Eisai’s global Clarity AD clinical trial, in which it met its primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints with statistically significant results.i,ii Clarity AD was a Phase 3 global, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized study in 1,795 patients with early AD (MCI or mild dementia due to AD, with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology), of which 1,521 were in the recommended indicated population in the label in the European Union (ApoE ε4 heterozygotes or non-carriers).ii The treatment group was administered lecanemab 10 mg/kg bi-weekly, with participants allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or lecanemab for 18 months.ii

The primary endpoint was the global cognitive and functional scale, CDR-SB ii In the Clarity AD clinical trial, treatment with lecanemab (n=757), in the EU indicated population (ApoE ε4 non-carriers or heterozygotes, measured by control-based multiple imputation), reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB by 31% at 18 months compared to placebo (n=764).i The mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups.i The adjusted least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.217 with lecanemab and 1.752 with placebo (difference, −0.535; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.778 to −0.293).1 CDR-SB is a global cognitive and functional scale that measures six domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care.[iii]

In addition, the secondary endpoint from the AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS MCI-ADL), which measures information provided by people caring for patients with AD, noted 33% less decline compared to placebo at 18 months.i The adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months in the ADCS MCI-ADL score was −3.873 in the lecanemab group and −5.809 in the placebo group (difference, 1.936; 95% CI, 1.029 to 2.844).i The ADCS MCI-ADL assesses the ability of patients to function independently, including being able to dress, feed themselves and participate in community activities.[iv] Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET) using Centiloids and ADAS-Cog14 also showed highly statistically significant results compared with placebo (P<0.001).i

In the EU indicated population (ApoE ε4 heterozygotes or non-carriers), the most common adverse reactions were infusion-related reaction (26%), ARIA-H (13%), headache (11%) and ARIA-E (9%). Symptomatic ARIA-E occurred in 2% of participants. Symptomatic ARIA-H occurred in 0.8% of patients.i

Lecanemab has been approved in 48 countries and is under regulatory review in 10 countries. In January 2025, the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for intravenous (IV) maintenance dosing of the treatment was approved in the U.S., and application have been filed in 9 countries and regions. Additionally, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted Eisai’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for the Leqembi subcutaneous autoinjector for weekly maintenance dosing in January 2025 and set a PDUFA action date for August 31, 2025.

Since July 2020, Eisai’s Phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) with lecanemab in individuals with preclinical AD, meaning they are clinically normal and have intermediate or elevated levels of amyloid in their brains, is ongoing. The study was fully recruited in October 2024. AHEAD 3-45 is a four-year study conducted as a public-private partnership between Eisai, Biogen and the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium that provides the infrastructure for academic clinical trials in AD and related dementias in the U.S, funded by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health. Since January 2022, the Tau NexGen clinical study for Dominantly Inherited AD (DIAD), that is conducted by Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU), led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is ongoing and includes lecanemab as the backbone anti-amyloid therapy. 

About the collaboration between BioArctic and Eisai
Since 2005, BioArctic has a long-term collaboration with Eisai regarding the development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. The most important agreements are the Development and Commercialization Agreement for the lecanemab antibody, which was signed 2007, and the Development and Commercialization agreement for the antibody Leqembi back-up for Alzheimer’s disease, which was signed 2015.

It is believed the reduction of protofibrils may prevent the progression of AD by reducing damage to neurons in the brain and cognitive dysfunction. v, Vi


[4] As requested by the regulatory authority, efficacy analyses were conducted for ApoE ε4 non-carriers or heterozygotes participants using control-based multiple imputation method, in which all missing values were imputed with copy-increments (change between visits) using the actual value in placebo group.vii This methodology differs from that used in the Clarity AD primary analysis which used mixed-model repeat measures (MMRM) with missing at random assumption.

",unknown,Leqembi® (lecanemab) launched in the EU today,"[*] Leqembi® (lecanemab) launched in the EU today Stockholm, August 25, 2025 – BioArctic AB’s (publ) (Nasdaq Stockholm: BIOA B) partner Eisai announced today that the launch of Leqembi in the EU started in Austria on August 25, 2025, and will be launched in Germany on September 1, 2025. Leqembi received the European Commission (EC) approval in April 2025 as the first therapy that targets an underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild dementia due to AD (early AD) who are apolipoprotein E ε4 (ApoE ε4[1]) non-carriers or heterozygotes with confirmed amyloid pathology.[i] Germany and Austria will mark the first launches in the EU. Following the EC approval, Eisai has been collaborating with the regional and local healthcare authorities to implement the mandatory authorisation requirements ahead of launch. The required controlled access program[2] is now in place in Austria and Germany, enabling the launch in these first two EU countries. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive, relentless disease with Aβ and tau as hallmarks. It progresses in stages that increase in severity over time, and each stage of the disease presents different challenges for those living with the disease and their care partners. There is a significant unmet need for new treatment options that slow the progression of Alzheimer’s disease from its early stage and reduce the overall burden on people affected by Alzheimer’s disease and society. Only Leqembi fights Alzheimer’s disease in two ways - targeting both amyloid plaque and protofibrils[3], which can impact tau accumulation downstream. In the Clarity AD clinical trial, the primary endpoint was the global cognitive and functional scale, Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB).i Treatment with lecanemab (n=757), in the EU indicated population (ApoE ε4 non-carriers or heterozygotes, measured by controlled-based multiple imputation[4]), reduced clinical decline on CDR-SB by 31% at 18 months compared to placebo (n=764).i In the EU indicated population (ApoE ε4 non-carriers or heterozygotes) (n=757), the most common adverse reactions were infusion-related reaction (26%), ARIA-H (13%), headache (11%) and ARIA-E (9%).
