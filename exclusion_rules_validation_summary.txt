GUIDANCE CHANGE EXCLUSION RULES - VALIDATION SUMMARY
=====================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
- Market research exclusion rule was too broad
- Included "CAGR" and "compound annual growth rate" as indicators
- These terms appear in legitimate company guidance (investor day presentations)
- Result: 1 true positive (Strata Critical Medical investor day) was incorrectly excluded

ROOT CAUSE:
- Companies use CAGR when providing growth targets/guidance
- Example: "high-teens target CAGR for adjusted EBITDA"
- These are valid guidance changes, not market research reports

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Removed "cagr" and "compound annual growth rate" from market_research.indicators
- Replaced with "market size" and "market value" which are more specific to research reports
- These new indicators better distinguish market research from company guidance

VALIDATION RESULTS:
==================

False Positives (should be excluded):
✅ Securities lawsuit #1 (prnewswire__7d9d4d1a828c8a12): EXCLUDED
✅ Securities lawsuit #2 (prnewswire__e45d311b92f17f3f): EXCLUDED  
✅ Market research report (prnewswire__3112a9d70933f504): EXCLUDED

True Positives (should NOT be excluded):
✅ 20/23 still detect events correctly
✅ 0/23 incorrectly excluded (previously 1 was excluded)
⚠️  2/23 don't generate events (unrelated detection issue, not exclusion)
📭 1/23 press release not found in dataset

CONCLUSION:
===========
✅ Exclusion rules now correctly distinguish between:
   - Market research reports (excluded)
   - Company guidance with CAGR metrics (NOT excluded)
   
✅ No false exclusions of legitimate guidance changes
✅ All known false positive patterns still excluded

The refined rules are ready for deployment.
