Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured above DKK 3,000 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus entering the targeted guidance interval for this business. COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 9, 2025 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) today announced the award of a contract valued over DKK 200 million to supply its MVA-BN ® smallpox/mpox vaccine to a European country. This is another larger order in recent years from the country to strengthen national preparedness against biological threats and epidemics like smallpox and mpox. Paul Chaplin, President & CEO of Bavarian Nordic , said: “As Europe continues to strengthen its resilience in the face of evolving geopolitical threats, we are proud to support efforts to increase public health security by supplying our MVA-BN ® smallpox/mpox vaccine, which remains a vital tool for managing mpox outbreaks as well as for safeguarding populations against future smallpox threats. This new order underscores the growing recognition of biological preparedness as a cornerstone of national and regional security. We remain committed to working with EU and its member states to ensure rapid access to critical medical countermeasures, reinforcing public health infrastructure and contributing to a safer, more secure future. We are also pleased to extend our collaboration with countries outside Europe, demonstrating the value of our long-term partnerships to build and strengthen preparedness.” The order will be delivered in 2025. Along with other orders recently secured from non-European countries, it brings the total value of secured contracts in the Public Preparedness business to slightly above DKK 3,000 million, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this arm of the business for 2025 (DKK 3,000-4,000 million). Total revenue and EBITDA margin for the year remain unchanged at DKK 5,700-6,700 million and 26-30% respectively.

Organic growth was -11%. Operating profit (EBITA) before items affecting comparability was SEK 877 m (1,069), corresponding to a margin of 14.0% (14.0%). Operating profit (EBIT) was SEK 743 m (903), corresponding to a margin of 11.9% (11.8%). Profit for the period was SEK 348 m (443). Earnings per share were SEK 1.09 (1.39). Adjusted earnings per share were SEK 1.38 (1.76). Free cash flow was SEK 1,302 m (1,395) during the quarter. Cash flow was SEK 392 m (990). CEO COMMENT “Dometic delivered a robust double-digit EBITA1 margin and strong cash flow in the second quarter, despite a more uncertain macroeconomic environment due to the ongoing global trade conflict. Net sales in the quarter totaled SEK 6,269 m (7,662), resulting in an organic net sales decline of 11 percent. Revenue in the Service & Aftermarket channel ended below expectations in the quarter showing a decline of 12 percent organically compared to a relatively strong quarter last year. Weaker end consumer confidence has led to a more careful approach to replacement and upgrades, leading to retailers continuing to be cautious with inventory levels, and delaying the gradual recovery we had expected to see. Organic net sales for the Distribution channel was down 7 percent impacted by generally bad weather in the US during the quarter as well as a temporary production stop in our US mobile cooling plant. We estimate that around half the decline in the quarter was attributable to the production stop. The OEM sales channel showed an organic net sales decline of 14 percent in line with expectations. However, we have seen organic net sales growth in LV Americas through the OEM sales channel for two consecutive quarters. The EBITA margin was 14.0 percent (14.0) which is on par with the second quarter last year. Despite lower net sales, the savings generated by the ongoing Global restructuring program combined with other cost containment measures have yielded positive impacts on our profitability. The EBITA margin improvements are mainly shown in the Land Vehicles and Mobile Cooling Solutions segments, where we saw improved EBITA margins year-over-year. In the Land Vehicles segment, EMEA and Americas are driving the improvements while APAC continues to show high margins but still below last year. The Marine Segment shows a robust EBITA-margin, but below last year driven by lower net sales. Free cash flow continued to be strong at SEK 1,302 m (1,395) primarily driven by improvements in working capital. The net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio remained flat at 3.3x and increased year-on-year by 0.4x due to weaker development of EBITDA, partially compensated by free cash flow and currency effects. We are maintaining a strong focus on profitability and cash flow across the Group and remain committed to achieving our net debt to EBITDA target of around 2.5x. Due to the current macroeconomic uncertainty it is difficult to assess the timing of when we can achieve this target. Dometic's transformative journey is progressing positively. We have taken significant steps in shifting the focus from a regionally led approach to a global product-led approach. We continue to invest in product innovation and sales capabilities in our strategic growth areas. The product innovation index reached 22 percent in the quarter representing a year-over-year improvement from 19 percent, and demonstrating continued progress toward our 25 percent target. During the quarter we launched the Dometic Recon Series, our premium innovative stackable cooler system, strengthening our Mobile Cooling Solutions portfolio. Together with our Gyro Stabilizer, launched earlier this year in the Marine segment, we continue to deliver innovative solutions across multiple market segments. Both product launches have been very well received in early customer feedback. We have seen cautious demand in the second quarter influenced by the ongoing global trade conflict. With approximately half of the Group's net sales in the US, we are exposed to tariffs primarily through their impact on consumer sentiment rather than direct tariff costs. Our exposure is limited as 85 percent of our US sales are from products manufactured in the US, or manufactured and sourced in Mexico and Canada with significant protection under the existing North American free trade agreement (USMCA). We have acted quickly by implementing surcharges to offset any negative cost impact and are reviewing our supply chain to minimize the go-forward impact. Considering the geographical spread of our manufacturing footprint, including nine production facilities in the US, we are well positioned from a competitive perspective. Long-term trends in the Mobile Living industry remain strong. However, it is difficult to predict how the current macroeconomic situation and weak consumer confidence will impact the business in the short term. We are focusing on operational execution and efficiency to be able to adapt to short-term market developments, which will benefit us and further improve our margins when we achieve net sales growth. Under normal circumstances and with current visibility on inventory levels, we would expect to see a gradual recovery in the demand through the Distribution and Service & Aftermarket sales channels. While it remains difficult to predict demand patterns in the coming quarters, we are encouraged by a stabilization in order intake. Going forward the comparables are becoming more favorable, and we expect both new product launches and our restructuring program to continue to contribute positively. We will continue to relentlessly drive our strategic agenda. With the restructuring program proceeding as planned, we are placing Dometic in a prime position to deliver on our targets while providing the highest quality of services and products to our customers.” Juan Vargues President and CEO PRESENTATION OF THE REPORT Analysts and media are invited to participate in a telephone conference at 10.00 (CEST) July 15, 2025, during which President and CEO, Juan Vargues, and CFO, Stefan Fristedt, will present the report and answer questions.

However, the global environment is uncertain, and we must adapt accordingly. Our focus is on what we can influence – our customer dialogues, the management of our properties, and our relationships in the capital market. This becomes even more important in a challenging rental market. I believe we should be proud of our strong performance. In line with our previously stated ambition, we have increased our growth efforts during the quarter. We have continued to invest in our properties and projects, and have also completed the acquisition of high-quality properties in Uppsala, Örebro and Linköping with a total property value of SEK 1.7 Bn.

Additional key performance indicators are available at elisa.com/investors (Elisa Operational Data.xlsx). CEO Topi Manner: Strong growth in EBITDA and cash flow In the second quarter, revenue grew by 2 per cent to EUR 552 million. The growth in revenue was affected by a EUR 12 million decrease in low-margin equipment sales, including a one-off, EUR 7 million deal in Estonia in the comparison quarter. Comparable EBITDA improved by 4 per cent to EUR 198 million, boosted by continuous improvements in efficiency. Comparable cash flow grew by 20 per cent, driven by growing EBITDA, positive net working capital change and strict CAPEX discipline. Relative to many other industries, Elisa’s business will remain stable in uncertain geopolitical times, even though we are not immune to all customer impacts. During the second quarter, we launched a significant upgrade to our consumer voice subscriptions, which now include a suite of security features: mobile ID, scam site blocking and data leakage monitoring. This upgrade was well received by customers, as witnessed by the decreasing overall churn rate, and resulted in an improved growth rate in mobile service revenue. We will continue the rollout of the upgraded offering during the remainder of the year and beyond. We became the first operator in the world to offer customers mobile subscriptions using 5.5G (5G Advanced) technology. We announced an agreement with Nokia on the extension of the 5.5G networks in Finland and Estonia. We were also the first operator in Europe to achieve download speeds of up to 8 Gbps with carrier aggregation in the 5G Standalone network in Finland, together with Ericsson and MediaTek. In Estonia, Ookla rated Elisa's 5G network as the fastest. To further enhance efficiency, resilience and customer experience, we announced expanded collaboration with Google Cloud to enable the implementation of AI-driven autonomous network operations. In the Corporate Customers business, we gained significant new customer wins. In IT services, the number of workstations covered by Elisa’s AI-enhanced service will increase by 40 per cent during 2025, strengthening our position among the top four IT service companies in Finland. For our B2B customers, we launched Moontalk AIRI, an AI-assisted service for companies that provides automatic note-taking and call summaries for phone calls. In International Software Services, we had several customer wins, especially in the telecom industry. As a result, comparable organic growth for the quarter was 10 per cent. The launch of Elisa Industriq brand continued during the quarter. Elisa’s long-term sustainability work continued to gain international recognition. In the latest report from Time Magazine and Statista, Elisa ranked as the 55th most sustainable company in the world. We were also included in the Financial Times and Statista Europe’s Best Employers ranking. Our performance during the second quarter clearly demonstrates our strong commitment to faster profitable growth, creating customer value by being a frontrunner in technology, and continuously improving our productivity and quality. Outlook and guidance for 2025 The development in the general economy includes many uncertainties. Growth in the Finnish economy is expected to be weak. In particular, there is continuing uncertainty relating to Russia’s war in Ukraine and other geopolitical conflicts. Challenges in global supply chains may also result in uncertainties in volumes and prices. Competition in the Finnish telecommunications market remains keen. Full-year revenue is estimated to be at the same level as or slightly higher than in 2024. Mobile, digital and software services are expected to increase revenue. Full-year comparable EBITDA is anticipated to be at the same level as or slightly higher than in 2024. Capital expenditure is expected to be a maximum of 12 per cent of revenue. Elisa continues to improve productivity, for example by increasing automation and data analytics in different processes, such as customer interaction, network operations and delivery. Additionally, Elisa’s continuous quality improvement measures will increase customer satisfaction and efficiency and reduce costs. Elisa’s transformation into a provider of exciting, new and relevant services for its customers is continuing.

Group operating income included a positive effect from the divestment of the Kelvinator trademark portfolio in India of SEK 180m. * Income for the period amounted to SEK 178m (-80) and earnings per share were SEK 0.66 (-0.30). * Operating cash flow after investments was SEK -741m (1,226), negatively impacted by an increase in working capital and the payment of the previously communicated French antitrust fine. President and CEO Yannick Fierling’s comment Market outperformance in North America, amid uncertain market conditions Organic sales growth was slightly positive in the quarter at 1.8%, driven by North America and Latin America. Business area Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa reported a slight organic sales decline, with a negative price development. In Europe, our main brands continued to outperform the market, whereas the general market demand declined somewhat with increased competitive pressure, and replacement driven demand. In North America, market demand declined slightly in the quarter, and we continued to outperform the market. In both Europe and North America, consumers continue to shift to lower price points and demand was impacted by uncertainty due to ongoing geopolitical developments. In Latin America, consumer demand increased slightly. As anticipated, in Brazil, growth was hampered by inflationary pressure and increased interest rates. Business area Latin America reported slight organic sales growth. Improved operating earnings with positive contribution from North America Operating margin improved, with a positive contribution from North America where list price increases offset increased costs related to U.S. tariffs introduced in the quarter. The competitive pressure and promotional activity were high in the quarter. Latin America continued to deliver an operating margin above our Group mid-term target of 6%. In Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the underlying operating income was lower mainly due to a negative price development. Operating cash flow was negative, impacted by a seasonal increase in working capital, a negative impact related to U.S. tariffs and a payment of the earlier announced French antitrust fine. Our market and business outlook for the year remains unchanged, and we reiterate our aim to offset tariff-related cost increases in North America through price increases. Looking ahead, consumer centricity and transformation in focus In the quarter, we executed well on our long-term strategic priorities. We continued our journey to strengthen our brands, with new marketing campaigns to support recently launched innovations. In the U.S. we are currently launching new Frigidaire ovens with stone-baked pizza mode. North America has been a focus point for improvements, and in the quarter, the business area reported a positive operating income. We continued to make good progress on cost-efficiency measures, delivering cost savings from procurement as well as product engineering. Maintaining a consumer-centric approach, as well as increasing speed and agility, are key components of our strategy. In the coming quarter, we will increase our focus on the major transformation areas and to drive speed and agility. The second quarter results demonstrate our commitment to deliver on our strategic priorities amid challenging market conditions.

Proposal to amend the articles of association (item 7) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based investment share program, as suggested in item 8 below. To enable the issuance, reclassification, and redemption of class C shares, the Board of Directors proposes to amend the articles of association as follows: An updated wording of section 5 is proposed in the articles of association. Current wording Proposed wording 5 Numbers of shares The number of shares shall be not less than 300,000,000 shares and not more than 1,200,000,000 shares. 5 Numbers of shares The number of shares shall be not less than 300,000,000 shares and not more than 1,200,000,000 shares. The shares shall be issued in two classes, ordinary shares and class C shares. Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share, whereas class C shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company. Holders of class C shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company’s liquidation, class C shares carry equivalent right to the company’s assets as other shares, however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue, one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights). Unless shares offered in such manner are sufficient for the subscription which takes place pursuant to subsidiary pre-emption rights, the shares shall be allotted among the subscribers’ pro rata to the total number of shares previously owned. Where this is not possible with respect to a particular share(s), shares shall be allotted through drawing of lots. The provisions above shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility for the company to adopt a resolution regarding a cash issue or set-off issue without regard to shareholders’ pre-emption rights. The provisions above regarding shareholders’ pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis to an issue of warrants or an issue of convertible instruments. Where the company resolves to issue only one class of shares by way of a cash issue or set-off issue, all shareholders, irrespective of the class of share, shall hold pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares pro rata to the number of shares previously owned. In the event of a bonus issue, new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith, the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue, following the required amendment to the articles of association. Reduction of share capital, which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital, may, upon the request of an owner of class C shares and a resolution by the company’s board of directors or the general meeting, take place through redemption of class C shares. A request from a shareholder shall be made in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed, an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company’s reserve fund, if required funds are available. The redemption amount per C- share shall correspond to the quota value of such share. Following notice of the redemption resolution, holders of shares shall promptly receive payment for the shares, or, if authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court is required, following notice that the final decision has been registered. Class C shares held by the company may, upon decision of the board of directors be reclassified into ordinary shares. Immediately thereafter, the board of directors shall register the reclassification to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The reclassification is effected when it has been registered and the reclassification been reflected in the central securities depository register. The existing shares shall be ordinary shares. The Board of Directors proposes that the CEO shall be authorised to make the minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with their registration. Proposal to resolve to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (item 8) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program for Group Management Team and other key employees within the Asker group in accordance with item 8(a) – 8(b) below. The resolutions under items 8(a) – 8(b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 8(b) below not be met, the Board of Directors proposes that the Company shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 8(c) and the resolutions under items 8(a) and 8(c) shall be conditional upon each other. Proposal to resolve to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (8(a)) Summary of the program The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term performance-based investment share program (the “Plan 2025”). The Plan 2025 is proposed to include not more than approximately 132 employees within the Asker group. The participants in the Plan 2025 are required to invest in ordinary shares in Asker (“Investment Shares”). Investment Shares entitle each participant to Performance Share Rights which entitle the participants to, subject to performance conditions, receive “Performance Shares” free of charge in accordance with the terms set out below. The Board of Directors intends to propose recurring tree year rolling programs subject to the approval of future Annual General Meetings, from the Annual General Meeting 2026 and onwards. The rationale for the proposal The rationale for an annual preformance-based investment share program, including the Plan 2025, is to create conditions for motivating and retaining key employees of the Asker group. It is important to Asker’s decentralised and entreprenioural business model that targets of the participants are aligned with those of the Company, including the Company’s business strategy, long-term interest and sustainable business. It is also important to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding Asker’s financial targets. The Board of Directors’ view is that it is desirable that the Group Management Team and other key employees within the Asker group are shareholders and thereby have aligned interests with the Company’s shareholders. By offering an allotment of Performance Share Rights, the participants are rewarded for increased shareholder value. Further, the Plan 2025 rewards key employees’ loyalty and long-term value growth in the Company. Against this background, the Board of Directors is of the opinion that the adoption of the Plan 2025 will have a positive effect on the Asker group’s future development and thus be beneficial for both the Company and its shareholders. Personal investment In order to participate in the Plan 2025, the participant must have made a private investment in ordinary shares in Asker by investing in Investment Shares. These Investment Shares can either be shares already held or shares purchased on the market in connection with notification to participate in the Plan 2025. Investment Shares held under the Plan 2025 will entitle the Participant to receive “Performance Share Rights”, whereby each Performance Share Right, subject to the performance conditions, entitle the participant to receive one Performance Share free of charge. Participants The participants invited to participate in the Plan 2025 are divided into four categories: * Group CEO, Group Management Team and Business Area Directors (approximately 12 employees): will be offered to invest a total of maximum 255,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 1,414 Investment Shares or more than 9,325 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of five Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, * Country Management (approximately 10 employees): will be offered to invest a total of maximum 70,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 754 Investment Shares or more than 2,825 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of four Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, * Local Managing Directors and Senior Key Specialists (approximately 50 employees): will be offered to invest a total of 198,750 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 472 Investment Shares or more than 2,350 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of three Performance Share Rights per Investment Share, and * Other Key Employees (approximately 60 employees): will be offered to invest a total of 114,000 Investment Shares, where no individual will be offered less than 472 Investment Shares or more than 1,425 Investment Shares within the Plan 2025, entitling to an allotment of two Performance Share Rights per Investment Share. In total, a maximum of 637,750 Performance Share Rights may be allocated to the participants in the Plan 2025. Individual participants within the same category may receive varying allocations of Performance Share Rights to allow for certain flexibility in the detailed distribution within each category. In order to enable control and create predictability regarding the maximum outcome per participant and the costs for the Plan 2025, the maximum value of the Performance Shares that can be allocated from each Performance Share Right is limited to 300 percent of the volume-weighted average share price in the Company during September 2025. Should the value of the Performance Shares allocated on the date of allocation of Performance Shares exceed this amount, a proportional reduction in the number of Performance Shares to be allocated shall be made so that the amount is not exceeded. Terms and conditions A Performance Share Right may be exercised provided that the participant, with certain exceptions, from the start date of the Plan 2025, up to and including the publication of the Company’s interim financial report for the first quarter 2028 (the “Vesting Period”) has kept their Investment Shares and has maintained their employment within the Asker group. Consequently, the Vesting Period for the Plan 2025 is shorter than three years. The reason for that the Vesting Period is shorter than three years is that the Board of Directors deems it important to implement a long-term share based incentive program after the IPO and annual long-term share based incentive programs are intended to be proposed at future annual general meetings and the Board of Directors deems it important to have the vesting periods ending approximately the same time every year. In addition to the requirement for the participant’s maintained employment, the final number of Performance Share Rights which vest shall also be conditional upon the below listed performance conditions: * An adjusted EBITA growth measured as compound annual growth rate (CAGR), * A reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets, and * Percentage of suppliers, based on purchase value, who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code (calculated as a percentage of COGS). The performance conditions are split between the three independent conditions listed above with 85 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to the adjusted EBITA growth, 7.5 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to a reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets and 7.5 percent of the Performance Share Rights relating to percentage of suppliers who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code. Adjusted EBITA The Adjusted EBITA growth is calculated as the CAGR between the year end result 2024 and the year end result 2027. Should the Company’s Adjusted EBITA growth amount to 17.5 percent, all Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. Should the Company’s Adjusted EBITA growth amount to 12.5 percent, 50 percent of the Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. In the event of an Adjusted EBITA growth between 12.5 and 17.5 percent, Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest linearly. An EBITA growth of less than 12.5 percent entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to Adjusted EBITA vest. The Company’s adjusted EBITA growth amount target shall be recalculated in the event of a share issue. ESG-targets Should the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions in line with SBTI targets be achieved (meaning a reduction amounting to at least 31 percent at the end of 2027 vs base line), all Performance Share Rights attributable to the target shall vest. A reduction of less than 31 percent entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to this target vest. Should the percentage of suppliers, based on purchase value, who have signed Asker’s Code of Conduct or an equivalent code be achieved (meaning suppliers covering at least 88 percent of COGS at the end of 2027), all Performance Share Rights attributable to the target shall vest. A coverage of less than 88 percent of COGS entails that no Performance Share Rights attributable to this target vest. Other terms and conditions for the Performance Share Rights The Performance Share Rights shall, in addition to what is set out above, be governed by the following terms and conditions: * Performance Share Rights are granted free of charge after adoption of the Plan 2025 and no later than 30 September 2025. * Performance Share Rights vest at the end of the Vesting Period and subject to the performance conditions being fulfilled. * Performance Share Rights may not be transferred or pledged. * The number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right entitles them to will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in the Company’s equity capital structure, such as a bonus issue, merger, rights issue, share split or reverse share split, reduction of the share capital or similar measures. Furthermore, in order to align the participants’ and the shareholders’ interests, the Company will compensate the participants for any dividends paid by increasing the number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right entitles them to. Preparation and administration The Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the Plan 2025, in accordance with the above terms and conditions. In connection therewith, the Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors, or the remuneration committee, may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Asker group or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of the Plan 2025 no longer serve their purpose or the rationale for the proposal. Scope and costs of the Plan 2025 The Plan 2025 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 which stipulates that the Performance Share Rights should be recorded as personnel expenses during the Vesting Period. Based on (i) that 637,750 Performance Share Rights are allotted, (ii) an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent, (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent, and (iv) that the performance conditions are fulfilled to 75 percent, the expected annual IFRS costs amount to approximately SEK 14.5 million and annual social security costs of SEK 4.5 million, with a social security tax rate of 21 percent. Based on (i) that 637,750 Performance Share Rights are allotted, (ii) an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent, (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent, and (iv) that the performance conditions are fulfilled to 100 percent, the expected annual IFRS costs amount to approximately SEK 19.3 million and annual social security costs of SEK 6.7 million, with a social security tax rate of 21 percent. Dilution Upon maximum allotment of Performance Shares, including buffer for dividend compensation, and provided that the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 8(b) below are adopted by the Extraordinary General Meeting, 670,000 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under the Plan 2025, meaning a dilution of approximately 0.17 percent of the number of ordinary shares and votes in the Company. This does not include recalculation pursuant to the terms and conditions other than buffer for dividend compensation. Preparation of the proposal and previous incentive programs The Company’s Board of Directors and its remuneration committee have prepared this Plan 2025 in consultation with external advisors. The Plan 2025 has been reviewed by the Board of Directors at a board meetings held in June and July 2025. Asker has no previous long-term incentive program. Proposal to resolve to authorise the Board of Directors to issue class C shares, repurchase issued class C shares and to transfer own ordinary shares (items 8(b)(i)-(iii)) All resolutions under item 8(b)(i)-(iii) are proposed to be conditional upon each other, as well as item 8(a), and are therefore proposed to be adopted in conjunction. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue class C shares (item 8(b)(i)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors, during the period until the Annual General Meeting 2026, on one or more occasions, to issue not more than 670,000 class C shares, each at quota value. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights, the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new class C shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorisation and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares under the Plan 2025. The number of shares that can be issued is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase own class C shares (item 8(b)(ii)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors, during the period until the annual general meeting 2026, on one or more occasions, to repurchase its own class C shares. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of class C shares and shall comprise all outstanding class C shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired class C shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorisation is to ensure delivery of Performance Shares under the Plan 2025. The number of shares that can be repurchased is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events. Transfer of own class C shares (item 8(b)(iii)) The Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that class C shares that the Company acquires based on the authorisation to repurchase own class C shares in accordance with item 8(b)(ii) above, may, following the reclassification into ordinary shares, be transferred to participants in the Plan 2025 in accordance with the adopted terms and conditions. In total, a maximum of 670,000 ordinary shares may be transferred to participants. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue, split, rights issue and/or other similar events. Equity swap agreement with a third party (item 8(c)) Should the majority requirement under item 8(b) above not be met, the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves that Asker can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice, whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares in Asker to the participants in the Plan 2025. Special majority requirements A resolution in accordance with the proposal in item 7 above shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds of both votes cast and the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the proposal in item 8(b) above shall only be valid where supported by not less than nine-tenths of both votes cast and the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting. Shareholders’ right to obtain information The Board of Directors and the CEO shall, if requested by a shareholder and if the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the Company, provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda. Number of shares and votes There are 383,036,497 shares outstanding in Asker, corresponding to 383,036,497 votes. As of the date of this notice, the Company holds no shares.

In Solutions, the growth was driven by a high activity level and overall satisfactory project execution, while the increased revenue in Applications was driven by the acquisition of SolidAl in June 2024, and organic growth from additional medium-voltage production capacity. In Service & Accessories, revenue growth was driven by a higher activity level in the Accessories business. Operational EBITDA increased to a record-high level of EUR 105m in Q2 2025 compared to EUR 86m in Q2 2024. The increase was driven by the Applications and Service & Accessories business lines. The operational EBITDA margin* was 14.5%, slightly above the 14.2% reported in Q2 2024.

During the quarter, NKT supplemented its high-voltage order backlog with a number of relatively smaller orders, including variation orders to existing projects. Free cash flow amounted to EUR -175m in Q2 2025, mainly driven by the ongoing investment programmes. At end-Q2 2025, NKT maintained a robust balance sheet, with net interest-bearing debt of EUR -757m. Execution of the high-voltage capacity investments progressed as planned during Q2 2025. At the expansion of the site in Karlskrona, Sweden, intense execution continued across several workstreams.

During the quarter, the new logistics centre was inaugurated as the first completed building. Construction of the new cable-laying vessel, NKT Eleonora, also progressed as planned.

Following the issuance of company announcement no. 83 at the end of April 2025, in which the company's board of directors chose to suspend the financial guidance for the financial year 2025 in light of the high geopolitical uncertainty, the board of directors has today decided to resume publication of the Company's financial guidance. The resumption is based on the following two elements: On Sunday, July 27, 2025, the US government and the EU Commission entered into a political agreement to impose a 15% import tariff on most EU goods. The agreement was described as a framework covering cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors – all subject to the 15% tariff – while a 50% tariff on steel and aluminium remained in force, as these were not included in the new agreement. As US is an important market for FOM, any clarity on import tariff rates are relevant to the company. A gradual return to a more normalized order flow and increased order intake following the end of H1 2025. Overall, the company believes in light of the above, a detailed review of the order intake and following the end of H1 2025 that there is now sufficient clarity on the expected overall development for 2025. The company's future and previous guidance (before suspension) is listed below: NEW FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2025: Total income: In the range from DKK 40 mio. to DKK 50 mio. EBITDA: In the range from DKK -25 mio. to DKK -15 mio. PREVIOUS FINANCIAL GUIDANCE - BEFORE SUSPENSION: Total income: In the range of DKK 40 million to DKK 60 million EBITDA: In the range of DKK -15 million to DKK -5 million ---//--- CONTACT INFORMATION: Company: FOM Technologies A/S CEO Michael Stadi Tlf: +45 20 66 60 44 E-mail: Certified Advisor: Norden CEF A/S John Norden Tlf: +45 20 72 02 00 E-mail: Communication: Gullev & Co.

We are satisfied with this development and performance, as we continue to deliver on our customer commitments and advance our major expansions.

Revenue (standard metal prices) is expected to be approximately EUR 2.65-2.75bn (previously approximately 2.37-2.52bn) and operational EBITDA is expected to be approximately EUR 360-390m (previously approximately EUR 330-380m). The financial outlook is subject to several assumptions including: Satisfactory execution of high-voltage projects and investments to deliver on expected profitability margins Satisfactory operational execution across business lines Stable market conditions for Applications and Service & Accessories Normalised offshore power cable repair work activity Stable supply chain with limited disruptions and access to the required labour, materials, and services Stable development in the global economy, foreign currency, and metal prices 13% organic growth and operational EBITDA of EUR 105m In Q2 2025, NKT’s revenue (in std. metal prices) amounted to EUR 723m, an increase of EUR 118m compared to Q2 2024, corresponding to 13% organic growth. In Solutions, the growth was driven by a high activity level and overall satisfactory project execution, while the increased revenue in Applications was driven by the acquisition of SolidAl in June 2024, and organic growth from additional medium-voltage production capacity. In Service & Accessories, revenue growth was driven by a higher activity level in the Accessories business. Operational EBITDA increased to a record-high level of EUR 105m in Q2 2025 compared to EUR 86m in Q2 2024. The increase was driven by the Applications and Service & Accessories business lines. The operational EBITDA margin* was 14.5%, slightly above the 14.2% reported in Q2 2024. At end-Q2 2025, the high-voltage order backlog was EUR 10.1bn (EUR 8.9bn in standard metal prices) compared to EUR 10.7bn (EUR 9.4bn in standard metal prices) at end-Q1 2025. During the quarter, NKT supplemented its high-voltage order backlog with a number of relatively smaller orders, including variation orders to existing projects. Free cash flow amounted to EUR -175m in Q2 2025, mainly driven by the ongoing investment programmes. At end-Q2 2025, NKT maintained a robust balance sheet, with net interest-bearing debt of EUR -757m. Execution of the high-voltage capacity investments progressed as planned during Q2 2025. At the expansion of the site in Karlskrona, Sweden, intense execution continued across several workstreams. The work inside the new extrusion tower progressed, as well as construction of surrounding buildings and expansion of the harbour facilities. During the quarter, the new logistics centre was inaugurated as the first completed building. Construction of the new cable-laying vessel, NKT Eleonora, also progressed as planned. Both the new production capacity and the new cable-laying vessel are expected to be gradually operational from 2027. Segment key financial highlights Q2 2025 Revenue* Operational EBITDA Op.

In the stock exchange notice and in the respective section “Key financials” of the report, it was erroneously stated that the result for the second quarter was a net loss, whereas the actual result was a net profit of EUR 4.3 million. Therefore, we are publishing again both the corrected notice and the amended report. MANAGEMENT REPORT Real Estate Development Tallinn By the second quarter of 2025, construction of the final phase of the Kalaranna development (4 buildings, 146 units) reached an end with some landscaping and a few client modifications works remaining. As of the publication of this report, 76 sold apartments have been handed over to buyers, and the overall sales rate has reached 60.7%. In Kristiine City, we are continuing the design and building permit process for four different projects submitted to the Tallinn City Planning Department: - ""Dunte"" - still awaiting the issuance of the building permit. - Sammu 2/4 / Sõjakooli 15 - building permit application was submitted in December 2024. - Marsi 1 / Sõjakooli 13 - building permit application was submitted in February 2025. - Sammu 3 / Sõjakooli 17 - we are in the design phase and preparing a new concept, alongside an application for a change of use to allow 95% residential and 5% commercial functions. The plan is to submit the projecting to the city within July 2025. All the above listed projects will add ca 35.000 sqm of GBA with ca 350 units of predominantly residential function (95% residential/5% commercial) to our portfolio in a well-established neighbourhood in Kristiine City. As of Q2 2025, construction of the White Building (91 residential units) in Uus-Kindrali project, located in Kristiine City at Talli Street 3 /Sammu Street 8, Tallinn, has progressed well. As of the date of this report, we have already begun the installation of final finishes (tiles, paintwork, etc). To date, the project has reached 62.4% sellout, with final completion expected in November–December 2025. Earlier this year, we had also started the excavation and foundation works for another 7-story residential building with 90 units, located next to the White Building at Sammu Street 10 / Seebi Street 24a, Tallinn. With sales we are at 12.2% sellout. To date we have almost finished the underground works and will start erecting the structure above ground. The expected completion of this residential building is planned for Oct-Nov 2026. Riga Following the successful completion of sales in River Breeze Residence at the end of 2024, with all units sold, the Group initiated preparations for the next phase of development in Kliversala – the Blue Marine project (96 residential units). Throughout the first half of 2025, we have taken key steps toward launching this new stage. The engineering team is now nearly fully assembled, and construction preparation started in July 2025. At the same time, we have collected interest from potential buyers. To support this next stage of development, two new subsidiaries were established in June 2025: SIA Pro Kapital Engineering, which will be responsible for construction project management activities in Latvia, and SIA BM Kliversala for the purpose of developing Blue Marine project. In Vilnius During Q2 we continued the construction of the final stage of Šaltinių Namai Attico with city villas and a commercial building. We are currently at almost 40% sellout in the villas and slightly above 10% in the commercial building while achieving record prices in Vilnius real estate market. Regarding construction we are on schedule to achieve substantial completion by the end of 2025. Our latest investment on Naugarduko Street in Vilnius involves transforming a former school into a high-end residential complex. Located on a hill with breathtaking views of Vilnius’ Old Town, the development will feature approximately 50 luxury apartments. The building permit process is still ongoing, with approval expected in Q3 2025. H otel operations Hotel performance in the second quarter was still slightly below budgeted expectations but overall, we are confident that the performance shortfall can be recovered by September-October. The second quarter result was expected to have some challenges due to the closure of the Thermal Baths for periodic maintenance, which very directly affected occupancy and tourists’ presence in our destination. We are confident that the property will maintain the positive trends of performance shown in the past years. Other operations The Group holds a majority stake in Preatoni Nuda Proprietà (PNP) and its subsidiary Preatoni Intermediazioni Immobiliari (PII), which continue to strengthen their presence in the Italian real estate market, focusing on bare ownership transactions. Despite the market slowdown in 2024, caused by rising interest rates, confidence in the real estate sector has been gradually recovering, with full market normalization expected by the end of 2025. Conclusion The first half of 2025 showed stabilisation across our geographical markets, despite continued bureaucratic delays and seasonal slowdowns in some areas of our operations. In Tallinn, we continued to make progress both in terms of construction milestones and in expanding our development pipeline within the promising Kristiine City area. Riga continued with the momentum in preparation of the Blue Marine project, where we are applying the successful in-house construction model used in Estonia. In Vilnius, we are concluding new sales with record pricing in our flagship project and laying the groundwork for a high-end transformation in Naugarduko Street. Overall, the Group remains focused on disciplined execution, strategic development, and value creation. We are well positioned to capitalize on the improving macroeconomic sentiment and deliver strong results throughout the rest of the year. Edoardo Preatoni CEO Key financials The total revenue of the Group in first six months of 2025 was 28.5 million euros compared to 6.9 million euros in first six months of 2024. The total revenue of the second quarter was 16.1 million euros compared to 3.9 million euros in 2024. The real estate sales revenues are recorded at the point of time when legal title is transferred to the buyer. Therefore, the revenues from sales of real estate depend on the construction cycle and the completion of the residential developments. Revenue from the sale of real estate increased compared to the previous year, as we continued handing over completed apartments in the Kalaranna District, Tallinn, following the initial deliveries that began in December 2024. The lower revenue in the second quarter of 2024 reflects the development cycle, as construction was ongoing and only a limited number of remaining inventory units were available for sale in Riga and Vilnius. The gross profit for the first six months of 2025 increased to 10.2 million euros compared to 2.4 million euros in the same period of 2024. The gross profit of the second quarter was 6.0 million euros compared to 1.5 million euros in 2024. The operating result in the first six months was 7.5 million euros profit comparing to 0.9 million euros loss during the same period in 2024. The operating result of the second quarter was 5.0 million euros profit compared to 0.2 million euros loss in the second quarter of 2024. The net result for the first six months of 2025 was 6.2 million euros profit, comparing to 3.0 million euros loss in the reference period. The net result of the second quarter was 4.3 million euros profit compared to 1.3 million euros loss in the same period of 2024. Cash generated in operating activities during first six months of 2025 was 8.5 million euros comparing to 4.5 million euros used during the same period in 2024. Cash generated in operating activities during second quarter was 7.2 million euros compared to 2.8 million euros used in the second quarter of 2024. Net assets per share were 1.01 euros as of 30 June 2025, compared to 0.93 euros a year earlier.

The revised outlook now assumes net revenue of EUR 485–515 million (previously EUR 530–565 million) and an adjusted EBITDA range of EUR 125–140 million (previously EUR 155–175 million). The downward revision of the forecast is due to two factors, which stand in contrast to the development anticipated in the original outlook. First, a one-off impact from more severe technical issues arising from the platform unification leading to direct revenue impacts, and in particular prolonged recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities after the completion of technical unification. Secondly, the Company sees significantly stronger negative FX translation impacts as well as outlook than Management previously anticipated. The technical challenges, which relate solely to platform unification of in-app marketplace activities on the supply side, have turned out to be much more demanding than anticipated in the extensive planning process of the project. In particular, noticeable delays in the onboarding of new customers meant that incremental new revenues could only be realized with considerable delays. Various technical issues in relation to load balancer performance, temporary interruptions in bidding volumes, and temporary asynchrony of AI algorithms, led to revenue reductions during the unification process. The process of unifying all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform has now, however, been completed in July, which will lead to significantly improved platform performance, cost efficiency and scaling going forward. The recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities has proven slower than expected, as observed in onboarding of new customers and customer scaling. Management foresees only a low probability of catching up on the unforeseen adverse revenue impacts from the unification process. These circumstances are estimated to have an adverse effect of approximately EUR 34 million on net revenues, which translates into a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately EUR 19 million. Additionally, increased infrastructure and one-off support costs during the unification process have a further adverse effect on adjusted EBITDA of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the development in the currency exchange rate between USD and EUR in recent months along with revised planning assumption for the remainder of the year leads to a changed and more material translation impact estimation for the full year. While the original outlook, published on 28 May 2025, foresaw a possibility of a lower conversion of USD into EUR, communicated as +/- 2 percent revenue translation effect for the full year, the current USD/EUR exchange rate is materially lower than the original planning assumption, and the Company has to factor in a USD/EUR exchange rate at the current level for the remainder of the year. This unfavorable development in exchange rates is estimated to have a translation effect lowering our full-year EBITDA outlook by approximately EUR 9 million. --- end of inside information pursuant to art. 17 MAR --- In order to provide markets with the best available information on the operational performance in the second quarter of 2025 – although not being the reason for the revision of the outlook for 2025 - the Company has decided to bring forward the publication of its half-year report 2025 to 15 August 2025.

Published: 2025-08-14 18:02:17 CEST FOM Technologies A/S - Half year financial report FOM Technologies publish H1 2025 Report. Sees early signs of recovery after turbulent first half year. 14.8.2025 18:02:17 CEST | FOM Technologies | Half year financial report Company announcement no. 89 – 2025 | Copenhagen, the 14th of August 2025 FOM Technologies today publishes the company's H1 2025 Report. A challenging period for the company, but with signs that things are slowly improving and commercial activity is rebounding. Following a difficult 2024, FOM Technologies have faced a turbulent start to 2025 as geopolitical and economic uncertainty slowed order flow, and delayed customer investment decisions. The newly established US sales organization was impacted by policy shifts in green energy, while academic demand in key markets paused. The circumstances led to lower revenue, weaker cash flows and lower EBITDA for the first half of 2025, with a 10–15% weakening of the US dollar against the Danish krone further negatively impacting the result. In response, the company implemented cost reductions, including workforce adjustments and a 20% pay cut for executive management and the board. Despite the difficult market, the number of inquiries increased, and the strategic product development continued as planned. The company has continued its focus on innovation during the period and will have launched its largest and most comprehensive product portfolio to date in the second half of 2025. Chairman Andreas Nielsen states: “ While the first half of 2025 has been among the most challenging periods in our history, we are beginning to see early signs of improvement. Despite continued global uncertainty, commercial activity is slowly rebounding, and customer engagement is gaining momentum.” FINANCIAL REPORT H1 2025 (1 January – 30 June 2025) ATTACHED.

CEO COMMENTS: FOCUSED ON OUR STRENGTHS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE – BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE Our overall group Q1 results reflect a quiet quarter for PC/Console releases. This year will be a transition year in terms of own major releases, and we will be highly focused on operational and strategic execution. Coinciding with the expected listing of Coffee Stain Group towards the end of 2025, Embracer will evolve into Fellowship Entertainment, an IP-first company powered by great creators and strong franchises in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. Through initiatives to improve and simplify our business, combined with a stronger release slate, we have the foundation for great long-term value creation. STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CREATIVE TALENT AND IP PORTFOLIO Over the last year we have made significant progress in transforming the group. Asmodee was successfully listed in February and we significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Coffee Stain Group is on track for its separate listing later this calendar year. With a powerful combination of strong IPs, engaged communities, and innovative talent, we are confident in its future as a standalone company. As Embracer evolves from a collective to a cohesive business in Fellowship Entertainment it will hold one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry with globally recognized franchises including The Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Darksiders and Remnant. We are laying the groundwork for a more agile and more empowered organization centered around such IPs. In our first quarter, organic growth amounted to -2% with net sales of SEK 3.4 billion and an adjusted EBIT of SEK 75 million, down from SEK 579 million in Q1 last year, or around SEK 250 million excluding the divested assets Easybrain and Gearbox. At the same time, our capex is down to SEK 784 million in Q1 from SEK 967 million a year prior excluding divested assets. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow improved to SEK 1.2 billion, compared to SEK -0.2 billion in the preceding period. These are important steps with regards to underlying cash flow generation. The quarter saw a contribution in line with our expectations from our Mobile and Entertainment & Services businesses, but the quarter was slower than expected for PC/Console due to softness in our catalog. We continue to be excited that Kingdom Come Deliverance II is widely regarded as a Game of the Year contender. In Q1 several competitor games launched, taking player time and attention with the result that we saw a slowing in our gamer acquisition for Kingdom Come Deliverance II. We responded by doubling down on all efforts for Q2 and beyond; our teams are focused on expanding the game’s reach with major new content drops. We have seen an impact from these efforts already in early Q2. Legacy of the Forge, the second expansion, to be released this fall, will add real gameplay depth to increase engagement, with a third expansion scheduled for the holiday season. Touching on Q2, Killing Floor 3, released in July, has seen a mixed reception and has performed slightly below our initial expectations. With upcoming updates and open communication with players, we believe the game has made a solid enough start and can deliver long-term value. On August 1, Titan Quest II started in early access with encouraging engagement and player feedback after an extended period of time in development. We now look forward to expanded content and a full release, including on console, for this action RPG game that stands out in the marketplace. NEAR-TERM FOCUS, LONG-TERM VALUE As we move forward, we are taking a conservative approach for this current year, reflecting a measured view on the timing and performance of our PC/Console release schedule in addition to potential continued softness in our catalog following Q1. This year is a transition period as we lay the foundations of Fellowship Entertainment and focus on building a business led by key IP and empowered teams, in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. It is paramount that we concentrate on the quality and long-term value of our releases rather than chasing short-term gains. We now expect our current financial year to deliver at least SEK 1.0 billion in Adjusted EBIT. On the whole, versus last year, we have incorporated further release shifts of one or several of the more important releases currently scheduled for Q4, as well as a slower growth trajectory for Mobile, negative FX effects and lower catalog sales. This conservative view provides upside potential, which we will work tirelessly to realize. For Q2, we expect to be roughly in line with Q1 on Adjusted EBIT, driven by the performance of already-released titles in July and August. We see no material changes to the management expectations for FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28. We have one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry and we still have 9 AAA games currently slated, excluding any AAA games financed by partners. As previously noted, one or a couple of these games will most likely slip into FY 2028/29, but we do see a clear increase in release cadence as compared to our average of just over 1 AAA game per year in the past five years. We expect the increased released pipeline in combination with lower fixed costs will notably improve free cashflow FY 2026/27 onwards. Coffee Stain Group is performing in line with expectations, with an intact outlook. We see that there are challenges related to Fellowship Entertainment and we fully recognize these. Nevertheless, we also see potential for great long-term value creation. In recent months, I’ve spent significant time listening to our teams and companies. As we move into this next phase of our transformation, I want to share three immediate priorities for myself and the management team to improve profitability and free cash flow: 1. IP-led focus – We are doubling down on our greatest strength: empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IPs. We accomplish this by an increased capital allocation to our core IPs. Over many years and across hundreds of game releases, our core IP had 3.1x ROI vs non-core at 1.6x. Core IP stood for 20% of capex a year ago, is expected to reach 40% this year, and it could reach 80% longer term, as we continue to reduce investments into non-core IP. Game development cycles are 3-5 years, and we are almost 2 years into this transition. 2. Operational discipline – We are not just renaming our group, but significantly rewiring the business to create one powerhouse unit within PC/Console. This comes through smarter collaboration, increased streamlining, shared services and with AI as an increasingly supportive force. These factors will be key to unlocking value and expanding margins. 3. Targeted cost initiatives – We focus on continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives relating to underperforming businesses, to free up capital to deploy with better returns. These initiatives could potentially include divestments. Assets that we so far have categorized as non-strategic had a negative Adjusted EBIT contribution of SEK 250 million and margin impact of 2% percentage points on a pro forma basis over the past twelve months. Our intention is to return excess cash to shareholders – either through dividend or share buybacks. Before this will be communicated and executed, we need to decide and communicate the intended balance sheet for Coffee Stain Group at listing, as well as adjust some banking agreements that we deem are more technical adjustments due to our solid net cash position. ACKNOWLEDGING CHALLENGES, BUT STAYING THE COURSE This is a pivotal moment. It’s time to channel our energy and sharpen our focus. Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential. The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become. It is both an honor and a deep responsibility to lead Embracer, soon to be Fellowship Entertainment into the next chapter. I am grateful to the Board, and to Lars in particular, for the trust and belief placed in me. Lars’ entrepreneurial legacy has built the foundations on which we now stand. We’re ready to shape what’s next.

CEO COMMENTS: FOCUSED ON OUR STRENGTHS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE – BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE Our overall group Q1 results reflect a quiet quarter for PC/Console releases. This year will be a transition year in terms of own major releases, and we will be highly focused on operational and strategic execution. Coinciding with the expected listing of Coffee Stain Group towards the end of 2025, Embracer will evolve into Fellowship Entertainment, an IP-first company powered by great creators and strong franchises in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. Through initiatives to improve and simplify our business, combined with a stronger release slate, we have the foundation for great long-term value creation. STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CREATIVE TALENT AND IP PORTFOLIO Over the last year we have made significant progress in transforming the group. Asmodee was successfully listed in February and we significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Coffee Stain Group is on track for its separate listing later this calendar year. With a powerful combination of strong IPs, engaged communities, and innovative talent, we are confident in its future as a standalone company. As Embracer evolves from a collective to a cohesive business in Fellowship Entertainment it will hold one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry with globally recognized franchises including The Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Darksiders and Remnant. We are laying the groundwork for a more agile and more empowered organization centered around such IPs. In our first quarter, organic growth amounted to -2% with net sales of SEK 3.4 billion and an adjusted EBIT of SEK 75 million, down from SEK 579 million in Q1 last year, or around SEK 250 million excluding the divested assets Easybrain and Gearbox. At the same time, our capex is down to SEK 784 million in Q1 from SEK 967 million a year prior excluding divested assets. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow improved to SEK 1.2 billion, compared to SEK -0.2 billion in the preceding period. These are important steps with regards to underlying cash flow generation. The quarter saw a contribution in line with our expectations from our Mobile and Entertainment & Services businesses, but the quarter was slower than expected for PC/Console due to softness in our catalog. We continue to be excited that Kingdom Come Deliverance II is widely regarded as a Game of the Year contender. In Q1 several competitor games launched, taking player time and attention with the result that we saw a slowing in our gamer acquisition for Kingdom Come Deliverance II. We responded by doubling down on all efforts for Q2 and beyond; our teams are focused on expanding the game’s reach with major new content drops. We have seen an impact from these efforts already in early Q2. Legacy of the Forge, the second expansion, to be released this fall, will add real gameplay depth to increase engagement, with a third expansion scheduled for the holiday season. Touching on Q2, Killing Floor 3, released in July, has seen a mixed reception and has performed slightly below our initial expectations. With upcoming updates and open communication with players, we believe the game has made a solid enough start and can deliver long-term value. On August 1, Titan Quest II started in early access with encouraging engagement and player feedback after an extended period of time in development. We now look forward to expanded content and a full release, including on console, for this action RPG game that stands out in the marketplace. NEAR-TERM FOCUS, LONG-TERM VALUE As we move forward, we are taking a conservative approach for this current year, reflecting a measured view on the timing and performance of our PC/Console release schedule in addition to potential continued softness in our catalog following Q1. This year is a transition period as we lay the foundations of Fellowship Entertainment and focus on building a business led by key IP and empowered teams, in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. It is paramount that we concentrate on the quality and long-term value of our releases rather than chasing short-term gains. We now expect our current financial year to deliver at least SEK 1.0 billion in Adjusted EBIT. On the whole, versus last year, we have incorporated further release shifts of one or several of the more important releases currently scheduled for Q4, as well as a slower growth trajectory for Mobile, negative FX effects and lower catalog sales. This conservative view provides upside potential, which we will work tirelessly to realize. For Q2, we expect to be roughly in line with Q1 on Adjusted EBIT, driven by the performance of already-released titles in July and August. We see no material changes to the management expectations for FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28. We have one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry and we still have 9 AAA games currently slated, excluding any AAA games financed by partners. As previously noted, one or a couple of these games will most likely slip into FY 2028/29, but we do see a clear increase in release cadence as compared to our average of just over 1 AAA game per year in the past five years. We expect the increased released pipeline in combination with lower fixed costs will notably improve free cashflow FY 2026/27 onwards. Coffee Stain Group is performing in line with expectations, with an intact outlook. We see that there are challenges related to Fellowship Entertainment and we fully recognize these. Nevertheless, we also see potential for great long-term value creation. In recent months, I’ve spent significant time listening to our teams and companies. As we move into this next phase of our transformation, I want to share three immediate priorities for myself and the management team to improve profitability and free cash flow: 1. IP-led focus – We are doubling down on our greatest strength: empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IPs. We accomplish this by an increased capital allocation to our core IPs. Over many years and across hundreds of game releases, our core IP had 3.1x ROI vs non-core at 1.6x. Core IP stood for 20% of capex a year ago, is expected to reach 40% this year, and it could reach 80% longer term, as we continue to reduce investments into non-core IP. Game development cycles are 3-5 years, and we are almost 2 years into this transition. 2. Operational discipline – We are not just renaming our group, but significantly rewiring the business to create one powerhouse unit within PC/Console. This comes through smarter collaboration, increased streamlining, shared services and with AI as an increasingly supportive force. These factors will be key to unlocking value and expanding margins. 3. Targeted cost initiatives – We focus on continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives relating to underperforming businesses, to free up capital to deploy with better returns. These initiatives could potentially include divestments. Assets that we so far have categorized as non-strategic had a negative Adjusted EBIT contribution of SEK 250 million and margin impact of 2% percentage points on a pro forma basis over the past twelve months. Our intention is to return excess cash to shareholders – either through dividend or share buybacks. Before this will be communicated and executed, we need to decide and communicate the intended balance sheet for Coffee Stain Group at listing, as well as adjust some banking agreements that we deem are more technical adjustments due to our solid net cash position. ACKNOWLEDGING CHALLENGES, BUT STAYING THE COURSE This is a pivotal moment. It’s time to channel our energy and sharpen our focus. Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential. The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become. It is both an honor and a deep responsibility to lead Embracer, soon to be Fellowship Entertainment into the next chapter. I am grateful to the Board, and to Lars in particular, for the trust and belief placed in me. Lars’ entrepreneurial legacy has built the foundations on which we now stand. We’re ready to shape what’s next.

It is paramount that we concentrate on the quality and long-term value of our releases rather than chasing short-term gains. We now expect our current financial year to deliver at least SEK 1.0 billion in Adjusted EBIT. On the whole, versus last year, we have incorporated further release shifts of one or several of the more important releases currently scheduled for Q4, as well as a slower growth trajectory for Mobile, negative FX effects and lower catalog sales. This conservative view provides upside potential, which we will work tirelessly to realize. For Q2, we expect to be roughly in line with Q1 on Adjusted EBIT, driven by the performance of already-released titles in July and August. We see no material changes to the management expectations for FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28. We have one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry and we still have 9 AAA games currently slated, excluding any AAA games financed by partners. As previously noted, one or a couple of these games will most likely slip into FY 2028/29, but we do see a clear increase in release cadence as compared to our average of just over 1 AAA game per year in the past five years. We expect the increased released pipeline in combination with lower fixed costs will notably improve free cashflow FY 2026/27 onwards. Coffee Stain Group is performing in line with expectations, with an intact outlook. We see that there are challenges related to Fellowship Entertainment and we fully recognize these. Nevertheless, we also see potential for great long-term value creation. In recent months, I’ve spent significant time listening to our teams and companies. As we move into this next phase of our transformation, I want to share three immediate priorities for myself and the management team to improve profitability and free cash flow: 1. IP-led focus – We are doubling down on our greatest strength: empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IPs. We accomplish this by an increased capital allocation to our core IPs. Over many years and across hundreds of game releases, our core IP had 3.1x ROI vs non-core at 1.6x. Core IP stood for 20% of capex a year ago, is expected to reach 40% this year, and it could reach 80% longer term, as we continue to reduce investments into non-core IP. Game development cycles are 3-5 years, and we are almost 2 years into this transition. 2. Operational discipline – We are not just renaming our group, but significantly rewiring the business to create one powerhouse unit within PC/Console. This comes through smarter collaboration, increased streamlining, shared services and with AI as an increasingly supportive force. These factors will be key to unlocking value and expanding margins. 3. Targeted cost initiatives – We focus on continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives relating to underperforming businesses, to free up capital to deploy with better returns. These initiatives could potentially include divestments. Assets that we so far have categorized as non-strategic had a negative Adjusted EBIT contribution of SEK 250 million and margin impact of 2% percentage points on a pro forma basis over the past twelve months. Our intention is to return excess cash to shareholders – either through dividend or share buybacks. Before this will be communicated and executed, we need to decide and communicate the intended balance sheet for Coffee Stain Group at listing, as well as adjust some banking agreements that we deem are more technical adjustments due to our solid net cash position. ACKNOWLEDGING CHALLENGES, BUT STAYING THE COURSE This is a pivotal moment. It’s time to channel our energy and sharpen our focus. Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential. The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become. It is both an honor and a deep responsibility to lead Embracer, soon to be Fellowship Entertainment into the next chapter. I am grateful to the Board, and to Lars in particular, for the trust and belief placed in me. Lars’ entrepreneurial legacy has built the foundations on which we now stand. We’re ready to shape what’s next.

CEO COMMENTS: FOCUSED ON OUR STRENGTHS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE – BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE Our overall group Q1 results reflect a quiet quarter for PC/Console releases. This year will be a transition year in terms of own major releases, and we will be highly focused on operational and strategic execution. Coinciding with the expected listing of Coffee Stain Group towards the end of 2025, Embracer will evolve into Fellowship Entertainment, an IP-first company powered by great creators and strong franchises in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. Through initiatives to improve and simplify our business, combined with a stronger release slate, we have the foundation for great long-term value creation. STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CREATIVE TALENT AND IP PORTFOLIO Over the last year we have made significant progress in transforming the group. Asmodee was successfully listed in February and we significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Coffee Stain Group is on track for its separate listing later this calendar year. With a powerful combination of strong IPs, engaged communities, and innovative talent, we are confident in its future as a standalone company. As Embracer evolves from a collective to a cohesive business in Fellowship Entertainment it will hold one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry with globally recognized franchises including The Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Darksiders and Remnant. We are laying the groundwork for a more agile and more empowered organization centered around such IPs. In our first quarter, organic growth amounted to -2% with net sales of SEK 3.4 billion and an adjusted EBIT of SEK 75 million, down from SEK 579 million in Q1 last year, or around SEK 250 million excluding the divested assets Easybrain and Gearbox. At the same time, our capex is down to SEK 784 million in Q1 from SEK 967 million a year prior excluding divested assets. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow improved to SEK 1.2 billion, compared to SEK -0.2 billion in the preceding period. These are important steps with regards to underlying cash flow generation. The quarter saw a contribution in line with our expectations from our Mobile and Entertainment & Services businesses, but the quarter was slower than expected for PC/Console due to softness in our catalog. We continue to be excited that Kingdom Come Deliverance II is widely regarded as a Game of the Year contender. In Q1 several competitor games launched, taking player time and attention with the result that we saw a slowing in our gamer acquisition for Kingdom Come Deliverance II. We responded by doubling down on all efforts for Q2 and beyond; our teams are focused on expanding the game’s reach with major new content drops. We have seen an impact from these efforts already in early Q2. Legacy of the Forge, the second expansion, to be released this fall, will add real gameplay depth to increase engagement, with a third expansion scheduled for the holiday season. Touching on Q2, Killing Floor 3, released in July, has seen a mixed reception and has performed slightly below our initial expectations. With upcoming updates and open communication with players, we believe the game has made a solid enough start and can deliver long-term value. On August 1, Titan Quest II started in early access with encouraging engagement and player feedback after an extended period of time in development. We now look forward to expanded content and a full release, including on console, for this action RPG game that stands out in the marketplace. NEAR-TERM FOCUS, LONG-TERM VALUE As we move forward, we are taking a conservative approach for this current year, reflecting a measured view on the timing and performance of our PC/Console release schedule in addition to potential continued softness in our catalog following Q1. This year is a transition period as we lay the foundations of Fellowship Entertainment and focus on building a business led by key IP and empowered teams, in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline.

This conservative view provides upside potential, which we will work tirelessly to realize. For Q2, we expect to be roughly in line with Q1 on Adjusted EBIT, driven by the performance of already-released titles in July and August. We see no material changes to the management expectations for FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28.

CEO COMMENTS: FOCUSED ON OUR STRENGTHS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE – BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE Our overall group Q1 results reflect a quiet quarter for PC/Console releases. This year will be a transition year in terms of own major releases, and we will be highly focused on operational and strategic execution. Coinciding with the expected listing of Coffee Stain Group towards the end of 2025, Embracer will evolve into Fellowship Entertainment, an IP-first company powered by great creators and strong franchises in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. Through initiatives to improve and simplify our business, combined with a stronger release slate, we have the foundation for great long-term value creation. STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CREATIVE TALENT AND IP PORTFOLIO Over the last year we have made significant progress in transforming the group. Asmodee was successfully listed in February and we significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Coffee Stain Group is on track for its separate listing later this calendar year. With a powerful combination of strong IPs, engaged communities, and innovative talent, we are confident in its future as a standalone company. As Embracer evolves from a collective to a cohesive business in Fellowship Entertainment it will hold one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry with globally recognized franchises including The Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Darksiders and Remnant. We are laying the groundwork for a more agile and more empowered organization centered around such IPs. In our first quarter, organic growth amounted to -2% with net sales of SEK 3.4 billion and an adjusted EBIT of SEK 75 million, down from SEK 579 million in Q1 last year, or around SEK 250 million excluding the divested assets Easybrain and Gearbox. At the same time, our capex is down to SEK 784 million in Q1 from SEK 967 million a year prior excluding divested assets. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow improved to SEK 1.2 billion, compared to SEK -0.2 billion in the preceding period. These are important steps with regards to underlying cash flow generation. The quarter saw a contribution in line with our expectations from our Mobile and Entertainment & Services businesses, but the quarter was slower than expected for PC/Console due to softness in our catalog. We continue to be excited that Kingdom Come Deliverance II is widely regarded as a Game of the Year contender. In Q1 several competitor games launched, taking player time and attention with the result that we saw a slowing in our gamer acquisition for Kingdom Come Deliverance II. We responded by doubling down on all efforts for Q2 and beyond; our teams are focused on expanding the game’s reach with major new content drops. We have seen an impact from these efforts already in early Q2. Legacy of the Forge, the second expansion, to be released this fall, will add real gameplay depth to increase engagement, with a third expansion scheduled for the holiday season. Touching on Q2, Killing Floor 3, released in July, has seen a mixed reception and has performed slightly below our initial expectations. With upcoming updates and open communication with players, we believe the game has made a solid enough start and can deliver long-term value. On August 1, Titan Quest II started in early access with encouraging engagement and player feedback after an extended period of time in development. We now look forward to expanded content and a full release, including on console, for this action RPG game that stands out in the marketplace. NEAR-TERM FOCUS, LONG-TERM VALUE As we move forward, we are taking a conservative approach for this current year, reflecting a measured view on the timing and performance of our PC/Console release schedule in addition to potential continued softness in our catalog following Q1. This year is a transition period as we lay the foundations of Fellowship Entertainment and focus on building a business led by key IP and empowered teams, in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. It is paramount that we concentrate on the quality and long-term value of our releases rather than chasing short-term gains. We now expect our current financial year to deliver at least SEK 1.0 billion in Adjusted EBIT. On the whole, versus last year, we have incorporated further release shifts of one or several of the more important releases currently scheduled for Q4, as well as a slower growth trajectory for Mobile, negative FX effects and lower catalog sales. This conservative view provides upside potential, which we will work tirelessly to realize. For Q2, we expect to be roughly in line with Q1 on Adjusted EBIT, driven by the performance of already-released titles in July and August. We see no material changes to the management expectations for FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28. We have one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry and we still have 9 AAA games currently slated, excluding any AAA games financed by partners. As previously noted, one or a couple of these games will most likely slip into FY 2028/29, but we do see a clear increase in release cadence as compared to our average of just over 1 AAA game per year in the past five years. We expect the increased released pipeline in combination with lower fixed costs will notably improve free cashflow FY 2026/27 onwards. Coffee Stain Group is performing in line with expectations, with an intact outlook. We see that there are challenges related to Fellowship Entertainment and we fully recognize these. Nevertheless, we also see potential for great long-term value creation. In recent months, I’ve spent significant time listening to our teams and companies. As we move into this next phase of our transformation, I want to share three immediate priorities for myself and the management team to improve profitability and free cash flow: 1. IP-led focus – We are doubling down on our greatest strength: empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IPs. We accomplish this by an increased capital allocation to our core IPs. Over many years and across hundreds of game releases, our core IP had 3.1x ROI vs non-core at 1.6x. Core IP stood for 20% of capex a year ago, is expected to reach 40% this year, and it could reach 80% longer term, as we continue to reduce investments into non-core IP. Game development cycles are 3-5 years, and we are almost 2 years into this transition. 2. Operational discipline – We are not just renaming our group, but significantly rewiring the business to create one powerhouse unit within PC/Console. This comes through smarter collaboration, increased streamlining, shared services and with AI as an increasingly supportive force. These factors will be key to unlocking value and expanding margins. 3. Targeted cost initiatives – We focus on continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives relating to underperforming businesses, to free up capital to deploy with better returns. These initiatives could potentially include divestments. Assets that we so far have categorized as non-strategic had a negative Adjusted EBIT contribution of SEK 250 million and margin impact of 2% percentage points on a pro forma basis over the past twelve months. Our intention is to return excess cash to shareholders – either through dividend or share buybacks. Before this will be communicated and executed, we need to decide and communicate the intended balance sheet for Coffee Stain Group at listing, as well as adjust some banking agreements that we deem are more technical adjustments due to our solid net cash position. ACKNOWLEDGING CHALLENGES, BUT STAYING THE COURSE This is a pivotal moment. It’s time to channel our energy and sharpen our focus. Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential. The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become. It is both an honor and a deep responsibility to lead Embracer, soon to be Fellowship Entertainment into the next chapter. I am grateful to the Board, and to Lars in particular, for the trust and belief placed in me. Lars’ entrepreneurial legacy has built the foundations on which we now stand. We’re ready to shape what’s next.

It will show that the continuing operations after 9 months have achieved a revenue of DKK 390.1 million, corresponding to a growth of 7%. The primary result (EBIT) was DKK 31.7 million compared to DKK 11.9 million in the same period last year. The Group's global furniture manufacturing activities, FurnMaster, remain up for sale and are reported as discontinued operations. These have generated a negative pre-tax result of DKK 4.2 million in the first 9 months of the year. As the realized results for the first 10 months of the company's financial year for continuing operations have exceeded expectations, the forecast for the financial year is upwardly adjusted. Thus, after 10 months of 2024/25, the continuing operations has achieved revenue of DKK 433.1 million, corresponding to a growth of 8%. The primary result (EBIT) was DKK 35.7 million compared to DKK 13.1 million in the same period last year. Previously, management expected revenue for the financial year 2024/25 (for continuing operations) in the range of DKK 495–520 million and a primary result (EBIT) of DKK 25–35 million compared to DKK 19.7 million in 2023/24. After ten months, revenue for the financial year 2024/25 is expected to be in the range of DKK 510–520 million and a primary result (EBIT) of DKK 35–40 million (DKK 19.7 million in 2023/24). Management expects that the challenging market conditions affecting the furniture industry will continue due to ongoing geopolitical risks and uncertain expectations regarding tariffs, inflation, currency conditions, and interest rate developments. However, the continuing business has continued to achieve growth in revenue and results, and management expects this trend to continue. The expectations still remain subject to a degree of uncertainty due to the aforementioned market risks.

As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 change its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. Preliminary and unaudited key figures for Q2 2025 and H1 2025 Service Products PC&V Consolidated Group Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Revenue, DKK 2.1bn 4.2bn 0.6bn 1.4bn 0.7bn 1.4bn 3.4bn 7.1bn Adj.

In addition, the Adjusted EBITA margin now also excludes Other Operating Net Income totalling income of DKK 59m and DKK 77m in Q2 2025 and H1 2025, respectively. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% The financial guidance for the full year 2025 has been updated. As such, FLSmidth now expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth now expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for original equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025. Presentation of the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report FLSmidth will, as previously communicated, release the detailed and unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025 on 20 August 2025. FLSmidth will host a conference call for investors and analysts on Wednesday 20 August 2025 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. The presentation can be followed live or viewed as a replay via the internet here .

The estimated cash consideration payable at closing is approximately EUR 60 million. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026. On Capital Markets Day 14 May 2024, Aspo published its portfolio vision: to form two separate companies, Aspo Compounder (Telko and Leipurin) and Aspo Infra (ESL Shipping), in the coming years. Aspo also communicated that divestment of the businesses is one of the strategic alternatives to be evaluated to maximize shareholder value. The divestment of Leipurin significantly strengthens Aspo’s balance sheet and enables future growth investments for the Telko business. The divestment of Leipurin is a major step in executing the communicated vision, along with Telko's already completed M&A activities and ESL Shipping's significant investments in best-in-class vessels. ”The divestment of the Leipurin business is the best way to implement Aspo’s strategy and value creation. During the past years, Leipurin has sold its equipment-related businesses, exited its businesses in the east and completed three acquisitions in western markets. We have also clearly improved the performance of Leipurin in recent years and supported the success of our customers. I am very proud of the transformation achieved at Leipurin and the work done by the personnel. As part of Lantmännen, Leipurin will continue to have an excellent framework for systematic and customer-driven growth and development,” says Rolf Jansson , CEO of Aspo Plc. “The acquisition of Leipurin is part of Lantmännen's strategy to broaden and strengthen the value chain in food ingredients. Together with our existing operations and the new plant-based protein facility currently under construction, we see strong opportunities for growth in both existing and new markets. With Leipurin, we gain valuable expertise in developing innovative products in close collaboration with customers,” says Magnus Kagevik , President and CEO of Lantmännen. In 2024, Leipurin’s net sales totaled EUR 133.1 million (2023: EUR 136.1 million), comparable EBITA was EUR 4.9 million (2023: EUR 4.5 million) and invested capital EUR 49.7 million (2023: EUR 46.0 million). Leipurin offers food ingredients and expert services in the bakery, food industry and food service markets in Finland, Sweden and the Baltic countries. Leipurin has approximately 160 employees. According to Lantmännen, Leipurin will operate as a separate business within Lantmännen's Energy Division, which currently includes food ingredients operations, such as plant-based proteins and oat-based ingredients. The sale of the Leipurin business will be implemented as a sale of shares, and it will cover all the companies in the Leipurin segment. Aspo will report the Leipurin business as discontinued operations starting from the third quarter of 2025. Upon completion, Aspo will record a sales gain of approximately EUR 16 million, which has an impact on Aspo’s reported result. The transaction does not have an impact on Aspo’s guidance for 2025: Aspo Group’s comparable EBITA is expected to be EUR 35–45 million in 2025. Aspo Group’s comparable EBITA expectation includes the comparable EBITA of the whole Group, including Leipurin business. Lantmännen is an agricultural cooperative and Northern Europe’s leader in agriculture, machinery, bioenergy and food products. Lantmännen is owned by 17,000 Swedish farmers and it has 12,000 employees and operations in over 20 countries. The annual turnover of Lantmännen is SEK 70 billion.

The second quarter also marked the closing of our US office, which has contributed meaningfully to the reduction in operating costs. The impact of these initiatives is, however, not fully reflected in the quarter’s cash position, as they have been partially offset by orders with outstanding payments at the end of the quarter – a result of transition from air to sea shipping. The total value of these payments is SEK 16 million, resulting in a current adjusted cash position of SEK 26 million. Earlier this week, we took another major step as we announced an expanded collaboration with our subcontractor. This initiative is expected to support further annual net cost reductions of approximately SEK 4.2 million once fully implemented. The number of systems sold in the second quarter remained at the same level as the previous quarter. Despite this, the quarter’s net sales, totaling SEK 6.6 million, represent a decrease compared to the previous quarter. The decline is largely attributed to a pronounced negative movement in the USD/SEK exchange rate combined with a one-off order of 10 BrainCool/IQool™ Tabletop Systems in the first quarter. Adjusted for these effects, the quarter-on-quarter decline in revenue was -18,7 percent. The order of systems from our US distribution partner was lower than anticipated, and we have intensified our contact with our distribution partner to gain insights into ongoing commercialization activities and provide further support where needed. Encouragingly, feedback from hospitals that have purchased the BrainCool™ System indicates a steadily increasing level of usage. This is reflected in the increased number of cooling pads sold in the first half of 2025. At ZOLL’s request, two-thirds of the projected order for the first half-year was shipped and invoiced during the first quarter of 2025. Hence, sales in the second quarter should be viewed rather as part of a growth in sales in the first half of 2025, compared to the previous year, than as a decrease in demand. This trend is reflected in the current order book, showing a positive development for pads also in the third quarter. We registered a decline in the quarter’s gross margin, compared to the previous quarter. This was mainly influenced by the weakened US dollar in combination with the positive offset impact in the first quarter seen from ZOLL’s one-off order of BrainCool/IQool™ Tabletop Systems – a high-margin product. Adjusting for these effects, the gross margin continued to improve on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Our efforts to achieve improved long-term gross margins continue. As part of this aim, we recently announced an expanded collaboration with our subcontractor, which is expected to result in net savings of approximately SEK 4.2 million. This initiative includes a tech transfer, which is expected to be fully implemented by January 2026. Alongside our efforts to establish BrainCool™ System in markets with attractive margins, we are continuing the development of RhinoChill® System, a state-of-the-art medical precision cooling system with considerably higher commercial potential. We are actively advancing preparations for the commercialization of RhinoChill® System, supported by ongoing clinical validation, regulatory planning, and production readiness. Given the significant global need for effective neuroprotective solutions in both stroke and cardiac arrest, the commercial opportunity for RhinoChill® is substantial. Two pivotal studies are currently ongoing to confirm its potential to improve patient outcome in ischemic stroke and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The COTTIS 2 study evaluates RhinoChill’s potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes in ischemic stroke patients that undergo mechanical thrombectomy (MT). In the US alone, 300,000 patients are treated using MT annually, translating to a total addressable market of roughly USD 3 billion. In May, the COTTIS 2 study was paused due to deviations found in a routine study audit. The deviations were addressed, and a report was promptly submitted to the German Health Authority BfArM. The authority requested additional input, which triggered an extended review period during the summer, but the study was recently approved to resume initiating patients again. Patient inclusion in our second pivotal study, PRINCESS 2, is advancing at a strong pace, demonstrating a high external interest in our technology and confidence in RhinoChill® System’s potential to improve outcomes for sudden cardiac arrest patients. Over 100 patients have been enrolled across five countries, with additional countries preparing to join the study. In summary, our efforts to reduce operating costs and improve gross margins are progressing well. While net sales were lower than anticipated in the quarter, the underlying trend support long-term optimism for precision cooling and BrainCool’s role in the ongoing transformation of critical care following cardiovascular events.

VÄSENTLIGA HÄNDELSER UNDER ANDRA KVARTALET 2025 DistIT träffar en överenskommelse med bolagets obligationsägare samt annonserar avsikt att genomföra företrädesemission. Transaktionen med obligationsägarna genomförs i juli 2025. DistIT slutför överlåtelsen av majoriteten av tillgångarna i sitt helägda dotterbolag Septon Holding AB. DistIT beslutar om en företrädesemission av aktier om cirka 168 MSEK. En extra bolagsstämma hölls 12 juni med beslut om nyemission samt ändring av bolagsordningen. På årsstämman den 27 maj valdes Forvis Mazars till nya revisorer. EFUEL blir officiell distributionspartner för Tibbers hemmabatteri Homevolt. DistIT erhåller godkännande från obligationsinnehavare för implementering av refinansiering av bolagets obligation. DistIT lämnar operationell uppdatering samt offentliggör informationsdokument inför företrädesemissionen. VÄSENTLIGA HÄNDELSER EFTER PERIODENS UTGÅNG DistIT offentliggör utfall i företrädesemissionen som gjordes i samband med refinansieringen av bolagets obligation. Aurdel Sweden AB och ELKO group väljer att inte fullfölja försäljningen/köpet av Deltaco Baltics UAB. DistIT beslutar om en fullt garanterad företrädesemission om cirka 106 miljoner kronor samt offentliggör preliminär finansiell information för andra kvartalet 2025. Slutlig likvid för Septon Holding AB erhålls. VD HAR ORDET STRUKTURELLA FÖRÄNDRINGAR DistITs konsolideringsarbete, som påbörjades i april 2024, är nu i stort sett avslutat. Aurdel och EFUEL, där vi ser en potential på längre sikt, Deltaco Baltics behålls tillsvidare och övriga verksamheter har sålts. Under kvartalet har en överenskommelse slutits med DistITs obligationsägare. Överenskommelsen innebär i korthet att halva lånet, ca 137 MSEK, förlängs i tre år och den andra halvan konverteras till aktier i en nyemission. Överenskommelsen innebär att vi nu har en långsiktig finansiering av vårt obligationslån på plats samt en stark balans-räkning med väsentligt lägre skuldsättning. Försäljningen av Deltaco Baltic har skjutits på framtiden i väntan på att litauiska skattemyndighetens granskning av bolaget har slutförts. Detta beslut fattades alldeles efter andra kvartalets utgång. FINANSIELL UTVECKLING I KVARTALET DistIT omsatte 244,0 (382,3) MSEK, en nedgång med 36,2 procent vilket är hänförlig till neddragningarna och anpassningarna av sortimentet i Aurdel men även till försäljningen av verksamheten i Septon och övriga avyttrade verksamheter. Bruttomarginalen för koncernen minskade till 1,5 procent (12,6). Bruttoresultatet belastades dock av försäljningen av Septons lager samt lagerreserveringar i Aurdel med 50,9 MSEK. Rensat för dessa poster uppgick koncernens bruttomarginal till 22,4 procent. Koncernens EBITDA för kvartalet uppgick till -73,5 MSEK och justerat för ovanstående poster till -22,6 MSEK. Baserat på höstens försäljning 2024 annonserade vi för sex månader sedan en ungefärlig omsättning på 1000 MSEK med en EBITDA på 40 MSEK för 2025. Aurdels utveckling under första kvartalet stödde denna prognos, speciellt genom stark försäljning över budget av våra egna märkesvaror. Efuel tog marknadsandelar men med en elbilsförsäljning under förväntan nådde vi inte riktigt de uppsatta målen. Andra kvartalet har inneburit kraftigare försäljningsminskningar än vad Aurdel planerat baserat på sortimentsneddragningen som startade sommaren 2024 samt pga en allmänt trög marknad i skuggan av oron på världsmarknaden. Även om variationerna är stora mellan länder så tappar alla länder samt både våra Egna samt Externa märkesvaror mer försäljning än vad vi har räknat med. EFUELs andra kvartal liknar det första: svag marknad men högre marknadsandelar och bra marginal. Visserligen har vi sett förbättringar i både Aurdel och EFUEL men målen tar längre tid att nå och förbättringarna är ej tillräckliga för att vi skall kunna vidhålla vår prognos för 2025. Med stärkt likviditet ser vi betydligt bättre möjligheter inför hösten och går bättre rustade in i 2026. AURDEL Rörelseintäkterna minskade med 33,2 procent till 168,7 MSEK (252,6). Bruttomarginalen ökade till 10,1 procent (8,9) där årets kvartal påverkades negativt av lagernedskrivningar på 22,8 MSEK. Bruttomarginal justerad för dessa avsättningar blev 23,6 procent (24,9). EBIT för kvartalet uppgick till -35,5 (-62,7) MSEK. Generellt sett verkar vår satsning på Egna märkesvaror tillsammans med en sortimentsneddragning av Externa märkesvaror och substantiella kostnadsminskningar vara rätt väg. Dock arbetar vi sedan ett år med otillräcklig likviditet och har haft svårt att beställa tillräckliga volymer av de produkter som våra kunder efterfrågar. De stora inköpen av Egna märkesvaror före kinesiska nyåret gav ett starkt uppsving i försäljningen i första kvartalet men för att permanenta det krävs en stark likvid bas vilket vi ännu ej har haft. Sämre likviditet har också fört med sig sämre betalningsvillkor och i vissa fall tappade externa varumärken då vi inte kunnat beställa tillräckliga volymer. Omförhandlingen av obligationslånet stärkte förvisso balansräkningen, men gav inget likviditetstillskott. Därför har vi nu föreslagit en nyemission för att förse bolaget med den likviditet som krävs för att återigen kunna blicka framåt och växa. Sedan tull-oron i våras ser vi också att kunderna, speciellt B2C, är försiktigare med sina beställningar. Därför har vi svårare att sälja av ”gamla produkter” och kommer att bli tvungna att sänka priserna för att konvertera dessa produkter till likvida medel för nya inköp. Med en bättre likviditet ser vi positivt på framtiden. Även om vår strategiförändring inneburit minskad försäljning av Externa märkesvaror har vi fortfarande en stark efterfrågan på våra Egna märkesvaror. En positiv signal är bland annat att vi under de sista dagarna i kvartalet passerade vi 600 000 användare av appen som styr våra smart home produkter. EFUEL Rörelseintäkterna ökade med 33,2 procent till 28,5 MSEK (21,4) medan totalmarknaden för AC-laddare visar en nedgång på ca 8%. Bruttomarginalen stärktes till 17,7 procent. (11,7) och EBIT till –0,9 MSEK (-4,5). EFUEL är väl rustat för ökad lönsamhet och tillväxt. De tar marknadsandelar, fokuserar på stärkt bruttomarginal och har god kostnadskontroll. Ett nytt CRM system samt fler tillbehör i sortimentsportföljen, bland annat från Aurdel, skapar ännu större möjligheter för effektivare försäljning i framtiden. SEPTON Omsättningen för kvartalet minskade med 56,6 procent till 47 (108,3) MSEK då verksamheten såldes i slutet av april 2025. Transaktionen belastade kvartalets bruttovinst med -28,1 MSEK. Bruttomarginalen minskade till -39 procent (21,5) och EBIT uppgick till -33,1 MSEK (1,4). Slutlig likvid erhölls under augusti månad. HÅLLBARHET Vi fortsätter naturligtvis med vår bas, hållbarhetsarbetet hos våra kinesiska leverantörer. För att ligga ett steg före har vi hållit ett seminarium för våra kategorichefer om vilka ESG krav som förväntas antas av EU. Även om hållbarhetsrapporteringen CSRD nu skjutits upp och vi inte längre finns med som målgrupp kommer en hel del av våra större kunder ha de utökade kraven på sig och därigenom kräva mer ESG-data från oss. Det talas nu också mer och mer om Eco-design, att rita och tillverka produkter som är lätta att reparera och lätta att återvinna, vilket säkert kommer att påverka våra Egna märkesvaror. Här står vi väl rustade i konkurrensen, bland annat tack vare vårt inköpskontor i Kina. Detta har stor betydelse redan idag och vi är övertygade om att det kommer att utgöra en ökande konkurrensfördel framöver.

The acquisition strengthens the Group´s offering in the Gothenburg region. The acquired business has annual revenues of approximately SEK 10 million OUTLOOK The market stabilization observed in the first quarter continues, although some uncertainty remains. Despite lower net revenue, profitability improved driven by lower costs and stronger margins, particularly within pipe relining. Important steps were taken in the flushing and energy segments through new contracts and acquisitions. The initiated measures are starting to yield results in the form of reduced costs and a more focused way of working. Additionally, the transition to operating under a single brand and unified market positioning is contributing positively. In the second half of the year, efforts continue to build a scalable and efficient organization, with readiness to act on the right acquisition opportunities. Overall, a more stable market and significantly improved operating profit (adjusted EBITA) are expected for 2025. The outlook remains unchanged compared to previous assessments CEO André Strömgren comments The stabilization trend observed in the first quarter is continuing, although some uncertainty remains. Profitability improved year-on-year, driven by lower indirect costs and stronger margins within pipe relining. Our transformation efforts continued at a high pace. The initiated actions have resulted in a more focused way of working and a transition toward a unified brand. At the same time, cost levels are coming down toward the target of indirect costs below 20 percent of net sales. The acquisition of Energiprojekt strengthens the Group's energy efficiency offering and enables a complete solution for the installation and maintenance of property infrastructure, with a focus on reduced energy costs and improved net operating income for property owners. In summary, a more stable market and a significantly improved operating result (adjusted EBITA) are expected for 2025. For full interim report, see appendix.

Published: 2025-08-15 07:56:57 CEST BioPorto A/S - Half Year financial report BioPorto Interim Result for the Second Quarter of 2025 - Continued progress with full execution of strategic objectives and strong NGAL sales growth. August 15, 2025 Announcement no. 19 BioPorto Interim Result for the Second Quarter of 2025 - Continued progress with full execution of strategic objectives and strong NGAL sales growth. Copenhagen, Denmark, August 15, 2025, (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – BioPorto A/S (“BioPorto” or the “Company”) (CPH:BIOPOR), today announced interim financial results for the second quarter of 2025 and a business update. Continued progress on key strategic milestones for the second quarter of 2025 Full execution of the objectives outlined in our February 2024 Strategic Plan. A major milestone in the second quarter of 2025 was the receipt of the first purchase order for ProNephro TM AKI (NGAL) for the US market, marking the first step in the commercial launch. The enrollment of patients in the US clinical cut-off study for ProNephro AKI (NGAL) for adult use is progressing as planned and is reaching the final phase. We maintain our goal to submit to the FDA by the end of 2026. Strong NGAL sales growth of 39% compared to the second quarter of 2024. The Board was restructured with Jens Due Olsen stepping in as Chairman and Carsten Buhl appointed as new CEO as of September 1, to drive the next growth phase. On April 15, 2025, the Company successfully completed a funding round of 25,000,000 new shares in a direct issue at market price providing gross proceeds of DKK 33.5 million. The funding round was met with strong support from existing shareholders. Peter Mørch Eriksen, BioPorto’s Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), comments: “The second quarter of 2025 marked a pivotal chapter for BioPorto, with the first US order of ProNephro AKI (NGAL) initiating our commercial journey and laying the foundation for a commercial platform to drive broad adoption of ProNephro AKI through strategic partnerships. We are pleased with the strong market momentum in the US and the progress in clinical studies toward the FDA submission by the end of 2026. With a clearly defined strategy and new leadership, we are well positioned to move into the next phase of our growth journey.” Financial highlights for the second quarter of 2025 Total revenue in the second quarter of 2025 totaled DKK 10.6 million, representing a 15% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by rising NGAL sales in both the US and the rest of the world (ROW). NGAL sales increased by 39% compared to the second quarter of 2024, driven by a 23% increase in the US and a substantial growth of 71% in the ROW, primarily due to a bulk order. EBITDA loss in the second quarter of 2025 amounted to DKK 18.4 million compared to DKK 16.2 million in the second quarter last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher costs associated with the adult clinical study. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s cash position was DKK 47.8 million compared to DKK 103.9 million in the same period last year. For the first half of 2025 total revenue amounted to DKK 18.3 million, representing a 2% decrease compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower Antibody sales due to timing in orders. NGAL sales rose by 5% compared to the first half of 2024, driven by a 22% increase in US NGAL sales. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 46.5 million, compared to DKK 31.5 million in the same period last year. Guidance Based on the results for the first half of 2025 and better visibility for the remainder of 2025, we narrow the full-year guidance for 2025. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of DKK 45-50 million (previously DKK 45-60 million). Sales for the rest of 2025 are still expected to be back-end loaded. Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of DKK 75-80 million (previously DKK 75-85 million).

Comparable EBIT is expected to be EUR 85–105 million. TOKMANNI GROUP CEO MIKA RAUTIAINEN During the second quarter of 2025, Tokmanni Group’s revenue grew, driven especially by Dollarstore’s strong performance in non-grocery sales. Dollarstore segment’s revenue grew by 8.8% in local currencies, with like-for-like revenue up by 5.1%. Tokmanni segment’s like-for-like revenue grew by 0.8%, mainly due to higher sales of groceries and Easter products, while demand for spring and summer season products was weak. Nevertheless, customer visits increased across Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. The development of Tokmanni Group’s gross margin was twofold. We succeeded in improving Dollarstore segment’s gross margin after a weak first quarter, with comparable gross profit rising by EUR 5.0 million compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, Tokmanni segment’s comparable gross margin declined by 1.4 percentage points. The decline was mainly due to decreased sales of higher-margin non-grocery sales, particularly spring and summer season products and increased share of grocery sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. We were not able to manage our operating expenses in line with our targets. As a result, fixed costs in both segments increased faster than revenue, largely due to higher personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel costs were driven up by wage increases, new store openings, and increased working hours partly because of the harmonisation of replenishment and warehouse management systems at the Group level. The Group’s weaker result compared to the corresponding period of the previous year was mainly due to these increased operating expenses and the lower gross margin percentage mentioned earlier. Measures to improve profitability at Tokmanni and Dollarstore are proceeding. These actions include strict cost control, particularly regarding personnel and marketing expenses, as well as efforts to enhance the efficiency of supply chain and store operations. We are also continuing the integration of Dollarstore into Tokmanni Group. In addition, we continue to develop our store network in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.

The Company went through unification of its in-app marketplace, which was finalized by the end of July, leading to improved platform performance. The key figures for business development are as follows : IFRS, in EUR m H1 H1 Q2 Q2 Q2 2025 2024 2025 2024 ∆ Net Revenue 215.2 179.0 106.1 96.6 9.9% Adj. EBITDA 59.6 51.1 29.5 29.1 1.3% Adj.

Leverage Ratio (vs. 31.12.2024) 2.5 2.4 0.1 Cash & Cash Equivalents (vs. 31.12.2024) 161.0 146.7 9.7% Net Revenue increased 10 percent year-over-year, or 14 percent on a currency-adjusted basis, to EUR 106 million (Q2 2024: EUR 96 m) while Adjusted EBITDA of EUR 29 million was slightly up compared to the same period last year (Q2 2024: EUR 29 m). Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA Margin reduced slightly to 28 percent (Q2 2024: 30 percent). On the demand side, Verve recorded significant gains, with revenue up 82 percent. Growth was primarily driven by both a continued influx of new customers and successful scaling of existing client relationships. Synergies from the Jun Group acquisition, concluded in August 2024, continue to make an increasingly positive contribution to Group results. The expanded brand and agency sales teams delivered first measurable results in the quarter, strengthening Verve’s market coverage and supporting further growth in client demand. The most transformative operational step taken in recent quarters has been the unification of all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform, with the integration process completed in July 2025. The migration to one technology stack, following years of intense planning and systems development, marks a major leap forward in structural efficiency and operational performance. “By eliminating costly duplication and data fragmentation from multiple legacy systems, Verve is now ideally positioned to drive further scale, optimize data flows, and enhance performance across the network”, explains Remco Westermann, CEO of Verve Group SE. “However, this strategic transition was not without challenges. The technical migration proved to be much more demanding than initially expected, leading to short-term operational issues including scaling, load balancer performance, and temporary interruptions in bidding volumes.” The technical challenges, which relate solely to platform unification of in-app marketplace activities on the supply side, have turned out to be much more demanding than anticipated in the extensive planning process of the project. In particular, noticeable delays in the onboarding of new customers meant that incremental new revenues could only be realized with considerable delays. Various technical issues in relation to load balancer performance, temporary interruptions in bidding volumes, and temporary asynchrony of AI algorithms, led to revenue reductions during the unification process. The process of unifying all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform has now, however, been completed in July, which will lead to significantly improved platform performance, cost efficiency and scaling going forward. The recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities has proven slower than expected, as observed in onboarding of new customers and customer scaling. As a result, supply-side net revenues were down -3 percent year-over-year. Management considers these effects as temporary, with most issues resolved by the end of the quarter and supply-side revenues further recovering and already approaching the previous year’s Q3 performance. Despite these headwinds, Verve’s KPIs point to a fundamentally healthy business development. The Company grew its total number of software clients organically by almost 10 percent, while maintaining existing clients with an all-time high client retention rate of 98 percent, underlining high customer satisfaction. Thanks to sustained strong customer growth and this continued high retention, an 8 percent reduction in ad spend by existing customer base led to only a 4 percent decrease in organic performance year on year. Higher infrastructure expenses and one-off support costs related to the unification process had an additional adverse impact on Adjusted EBITDA. Nevertheless, the slight increase during the platform migration reflects disciplined expense management. As new capabilities from the unified platform are leveraged and ramp-up effects dissipate, further margin improvement is expected in the coming quarters. Having completed the platform unification of its largest revenue driver in-app in July, platform performance has improved considerably. The new combined platforms are continuously enhanced and onboarding of new customers has been resumed, which will lead to increased revenues and improved margins in the second half of the year. The supply side platform unifications for other formats, such as CTV, will conclude within the coming quarters and are expected to have only minor impacts on upcoming results. Outlook The further expansion of the sales team, with increased headcount and stronger segment focus, is already starting to contribute to growth. Despite the slight pressure seen in the market during Q2, historical trends show advertising budgets typically rebound swiftly following temporary contractions. Since mid-June, market sentiment has stabilized and continues to stabilize further into Q3. As published, the Company has reduced its outlook for the full year 2025. In terms of net revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The revised outlook entails a net revenue range of EUR 485 to 515 million (previously EUR 530 to 565 million) and an adjusted EBITDA of range of EUR 125 to 140 million (previously EUR 155 to 175 million). The downward revision of the forecast is due to two factors, which stand in contrast to the development anticipated in the original outlook. First, a one-off impact from more severe technical issues arising from the platform unification leading to direct revenue impacts, and in particular prolonged recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities after the completion of technical unification. Secondly, the Company sees significantly stronger negative FX translation impacts as well as outlook than Management previously anticipated In order to give existing and interested investors an even better understanding of Verve Group SE's technologically sophisticated business model, the Company will host a Capital Markets Day on 19 August, starting at 10:00 CEST. The Capital Markets Day will be hosted as a hybrid event, live in Stockholm and online as interactive webcast.

Q2 2025 organic growth ended at 8%. Like-for-like (LFL) was 3% and network expansion added 5% to growth. LFL growth in the US remained strong at 8%, and Rest of Pandora was robust at 6%. Despite some challenges in the four European markets disclosed separately, overall LFL in Europe was 1% fuelled by double-digit growth in several countries, including for example Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Poland. The gross margin remained strong at 79.3% despite 170bp headwind from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs (80.2% in Q2 2024). Pricing and cost efficiencies continued to contribute positively. The Q2 2025 EBIT margin landed at 18.2%. The margin declined by 160bp Y/Y reflecting 230bp of headwinds from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs. In constant currency, the EBIT margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025. Reported EPS growth in Q2 2025 was 6% (18% in constant currency). PHOENIX STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS To position Pandora as a full jewellery brand, Pandora continues to invest across all four strategy pillars: brand, design, markets and personalisation. A number of key strategic initiatives are lined up for H2 2025, including an exciting product pipeline with two new collections, Pandora Talisman and Minis, that refresh the core charms & carriers offering with new styles whilst also strengthening the affordability position. Pandora is preparing a new chapter of the “BE LOVE” marketing campaign with a holiday campaign that deepens emotional connection through storytelling, anchored in Pandora’s brand DNA. Additionally, in selected markets, Pandora will invest behind locally relevant talent, strengthening cultural resonance and boosting social engagement to inspire consumers. Pandora’s full jewellery brand message continues to resonate with consumers and is visible in the numbers with LFL growth in the “Core” segment in Q2 of 1% whilst the “Fuel with more” segment drove 5% LFL growth. Despite 30bp further headwind from commodity prices and foreign exchange since the Q1 2025 report, Pandora remains on track towards the target of an EBIT margin of “around 25%” in 2026 (excl. tariffs). The current tariff level adds 120bp headwind in 2026 and Pandora currently expects to deliver “at least 24%” EBIT margin incl. tariffs. 2025 GUIDANCE AND CURRENT TRADING Pandora maintains the guidance for 2025 of “7-8% organic growth” while noting the elevated macro uncertainty. The EBIT margin guidance for 2025 is also maintained at “around 24%” despite including the 60bp headwind based on current tariff levels. Current trading in July has seen LFL growth at around 2%. This has been negatively impacted by a) a weak End of Season Sale and b) the timing of product launches with PANDORA ESSENCE being launched in May 2024 while Talisman/Minis will be launched at the end of Q3 2025. Alexander Lacik, President and CEO of Pandora, says: “In these turbulent times, we are satisfied with yet another quarter of high single-digit organic growth and strong profitability. The results show that our brand and unique storytelling proposition continue to attract more consumers and that our global footprint enables us to balance ups and downs across the markets. Despite the macroeconomic challenges to top and bottom line, we are confident that we will deliver on our targets for the year driven by an exciting product pipeline, new marketing campaigns and operational agility.” DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 FY 2024 FY 2025 guidance Revenue 7,075 6,771 14,421 13,605 31,680 Organic growth 8% 15% 7% 16% 13% 7-8% Like-for-Like, % 3% 8% 4% 9% 7% Operating profit (EBIT) 1,287 1,338 2,928 2,845 7,974 EBIT margin, % 18.2% 19.8% 20.3% 20.9% 25.2% Around 24% Attachments Pandora Q2 2025 Interim Report Company Announcement_No_965 Pandora Appendix Company Announcement Q2 2025 Attachments: Pandora Appendix Company Announcement Q2 2025.xlsx Pandora Q2 2025 Interim Report Company Announcement_No_965.pdf This email message was delivered to Cancel this subscription This news release was distributed by Company News System, nasdaq.com/european-market-activity/news/company-news"

Q2 2025 organic growth ended at 8%. Like-for-like (LFL) was 3% and network expansion added 5% to growth. LFL growth in the US remained strong at 8%, and Rest of Pandora was robust at 6%. Despite some challenges in the four European markets disclosed separately, overall LFL in Europe was 1% fuelled by double-digit growth in several countries, including for example Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Poland. The gross margin remained strong at 79.3% despite 170bp headwind from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs (80.2% in Q2 2024). Pricing and cost efficiencies continued to contribute positively. The Q2 2025 EBIT margin landed at 18.2%. The margin declined by 160bp Y/Y reflecting 230bp of headwinds from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs. In constant currency, the EBIT margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025. Reported EPS growth in Q2 2025 was 6% (18% in constant currency). PHOENIX STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS To position Pandora as a full jewellery brand, Pandora continues to invest across all four strategy pillars: brand, design, markets and personalisation. A number of key strategic initiatives are lined up for H2 2025, including an exciting product pipeline with two new collections, Pandora Talisman and Minis, that refresh the core charms & carriers offering with new styles whilst also strengthening the affordability position. Pandora is preparing a new chapter of the “BE LOVE” marketing campaign with a holiday campaign that deepens emotional connection through storytelling, anchored in Pandora’s brand DNA. Additionally, in selected markets, Pandora will invest behind locally relevant talent, strengthening cultural resonance and boosting social engagement to inspire consumers. Pandora’s full jewellery brand message continues to resonate with consumers and is visible in the numbers with LFL growth in the “Core” segment in Q2 of 1% whilst the “Fuel with more” segment drove 5% LFL growth. Despite 30bp further headwind from commodity prices and foreign exchange since the Q1 2025 report, Pandora remains on track towards the target of an EBIT margin of “around 25%” in 2026 (excl. tariffs). The current tariff level adds 120bp headwind in 2026 and Pandora currently expects to deliver “at least 24%” EBIT margin incl. tariffs. 2025 GUIDANCE AND CURRENT TRADING Pandora maintains the guidance for 2025 of “7-8% organic growth” while noting the elevated macro uncertainty. The EBIT margin guidance for 2025 is also maintained at “around 24%” despite including the 60bp headwind based on current tariff levels. Current trading in July has seen LFL growth at around 2%. This has been negatively impacted by a) a weak End of Season Sale and b) the timing of product launches with PANDORA ESSENCE being launched in May 2024 while Talisman/Minis will be launched at the end of Q3 2025.

Item 13 – Resolution on (a) implementation of a long-term incentive programme; and (b) authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares as well as a resolution on transfer of own shares The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term share and performance based incentive programme (“ LTIP 2025 ”) for members of the executive management and certain other key employees in the Rusta group (the “ Group ”) in accordance with the principle terms and conditions further set out in item (a) below. For the purpose of securing the Company’s commitments under LTIP 2025 and thereto related costs, the board of directors further proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on (i) authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares and (ii) transfer of own shares in accordance with what is set out under item (b) below. Resolution on (a) implementation of a long-term incentive programme Motive The principle motive for implementing LTIP 2025 is to align the interests of the executive management and other key employees with the interests of the shareholders in order to ensure maximum long-term value growth and to promote shareholding in the Company. LTIP 2025 is further deemed to facilitate the Company’s recruitment and retention of members of the executive management and other key employees. At the annual general meeting on 1 September 2023, it was resolved, in accordance with the board of directors’ proposal, to implement a long-term share and performance based incentive programme for members of the executive management and other certain other key employees (“ LTIP 2023 ”). The board of directors’ intention was to create a long-term structure for the programme, and to, following evaluation of the programme, present corresponding proposals at general meetings in the coming years. Taking the board of directors’ intention for LTIP 2023 and the subsequent evaluation into consideration, a proposal, which was later adopted, for an incentive program, was submitted to the annual general meeting on 20 September 2024 (“ LTIP 2024 ”) having, in general, the same structure and content as LTIP 2023. The proposal for LTIP 2025 has been prepared taking the board of directors’ original intention for LTIP 2023 and the subsequent evaluation of LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024 into consideration. It remains the board of directors’ intention that the structure for the programme shall be long-term and it is therefore the board of directors’ intention to, following evaluation of the programme, present corresponding proposals for general meetings in the coming years. It is the board of directors’ intention that a new programme is to be implemented each year. LTIP 2025 in brief LTIP 2025 encompasses up to 40 employees consisting of members of the executive management and certain other key employees, as further defined below (each such person is referred to below as a “ Participant ” and together the “ Participants ”). To participate in LTIP 2025, the Participant is required to have a shareholding in the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the programme and allocate such shares to the programme (the “ Savings Shares ”). Provided that the Savings Shares are retained during the determined vesting period of three years and that the Participant remains employed within the Group during the entire vesting period, the Participant will for each Savings Share be entitled to receive 0.5 shares in the Company free of charge (“ Matching Shares ”) and – provided that the performance target as further defined below are fulfilled – a maximum of 5 additional shares in the Company (the “ Performance Shares ”, and the right underlying the receipt of the Matching Shares and the Performance Shares collectively being referred to below as the “ Share Right ”). In accordance with the board of directors’ proposal, a maximum of 238,162 shares in the Company may be awarded as Matching Shares and Performance Shares under LTIP 2025, corresponding to approximately 0.16 per cent of all shares and votes in the Company. The Participants of LTIP 2025 The Participants of LTIP 2025 consist of four categories of employees. The first category comprises the Company’s executive management, excluding the CEO, as well as CEO’s and sales managers of the Company’s sales markets (up to 12 persons) (“ Category 1 ”), the second category comprises certain key employees in management functions (up to 2 persons) (“ Category 2 ”), the third category comprises employees deemed to have significant responsibilities within the Group (up to 8 persons) (“ Category 3 ”) and the fourth category comprises employees with special responsibilities within the Group (up to 18 persons) (“ Category 4 ”). The Participant’s investment In order to participate in LTIP 2025, the Participant is required to enter into an agreement with the Company and maintain a shareholding in the Company during the Vesting Period, as specified below, and allocate these shares as Savings Shares to LTIP 2025. The Savings Shares can either be acquired for LTIP 2025 or be already held shares provided that the shares have not already been allocated to an ongoing incentive programme. To be eligible to participate in LTIP 2025, the Participant, regardless of category, must allocate Savings Shares up to an amount at least equal to the maximum investment amount for the Participants in Category 4. The total number of Savings Shares that may be allocated by a Participant under LTIP 2025 shall further be limited to the maximum investment amount for each category (the “ Investment Amount ”), as set out below. The Investment Amount shall, after the annual general meeting but before agreements regarding participation in LTIP 2025 is entered into with the Participants, be converted into a fixed minimum and maximum number of Savings Shares that each Participant may allocate to LTIP 2025. This is done by dividing each Participant’s Investment Amount by the volume-weighted average price paid for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from and including 22 September 2025 up to and including 29 September 2025 (the “ Payment Price ”), whereby the nearest whole number of shares (rounded downwards) shall constitute the respective Participant’s highest and lowest number of Savings Shares within LTIP 2025. This means that the actual number of Savings Shares per Participant will be calculated after the Payment Price has been determined. If the Payment Price during said period is low enough that the number of Share Rights which the total maximum number of Savings Shares, calculated in accordance with the above, may entitle to thereby exceeds 238,162, the number of Savings Shares that each Participant may allocate shall be reduced pro rata to the extent required for the programme to comprise a maximum of 238,162 Share Rights. Category Maximum number of Participants per category Minimum Investment Amount per Participant (SEK) Maximum Investment Amount per Participant (SEK) 1 12 30,000 135,000 2 2 30,000 70,000 3 8 30,000 60,000 4 18 30,000 30,000 To the extent that the Participants do not already hold shares in the Company, the Savings Shares shall be acquired at market price through acquisitions on Nasdaq Stockholm no later than two months from the date on which the Participant entered into an agreement with the Company regarding participation in LTIP 2025. If the Participant is prevented from acquiring the Savings Shares during this period pursuant to market abuse rules or similar rules, or for other reasons in exceptional cases, the board of directors shall be entitled to extend the investment period for the relevant Participants, however, by no more than two months. Savings Shares held by the Participant prior to the expiry of the investment period (including any extension) shall be deemed to have been held by the Participant at the start of LTIP 2025. The Participants shall, after recalculation of the Investment Amount to a fixed maximum and minimum number of Savings Shares as set out above, allocate at most the maximum number of Savings Shares for the Participant’s respective category and at least the maximum number of Savings Shares for Category 4. For Participants in Category 4, the maximum number of Savings Shares is therefore also the minimum number of Savings Shares required to participate in LTIP 2025. For Participants in Category 1, a number of Savings Shares in the range between Category 1 and 4 is required. For Participants in Category 2, a number of Savings Shares in the range between Category 2 and 4 is required. For Participants in Category 3, a number of Savings Shares in the range between Category 3 and 4 is required. Vesting Period and award of shares under Share Rights The vesting period commences on the date on which the Participants enter into an agreement with the Company regarding participation in LTIP 2025 and continues until the date falling three years thereafter (the “ Vesting Period ”). Any award of shares under Share Rights shall normally be made within two months from the publication of the Company’s interim report for the period May – July 2028. In the event that the Participants cannot be awarded shares pursuant to applicable law, at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts, the board of directors may decide to offer the Participants an award in cash instead. Conditions for Share Rights For each Savings Share held during the Vesting Period, the Participant will, after the end of the Vesting Period, be awarded 0.5 Matching Shares and a maximum of 5 Performance Shares. All Share Rights shall further be subject to the following conditions: Share Rights cannot be transferred or pledged. The right to be awarded shares pursuant to Share Rights requires that the Participant has not disposed of the Savings Shares that have formed the basis for the award of the Share Rights during the Vesting Period and, with certain exceptions, that the Participant remains employed within the Group during the Vesting Period. The board of directors may in special cases grant exemptions from these requirements. The award of Performance Shares is further subject to the fulfilment of certain performance targets as further described under the heading “ Performance targets ” below. Shares in the Company are awarded free of charge. Each Share Right entitles the Participant to one (1) share in the Company. If the number of Share Rights is not a whole number, the number will be rounded down and no compensation will be paid for any excess fractions of Share Rights that cannot be utilised. A prerequisite for participation in LTIP 2025 is that such participation is legally possible and that, in the Company’s judgement, such participation can be made with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts for the Company. Performance targets The performance targets are divided into three targets – target 1, target 2 and target 3 – which are described in more detail below. For awards of Performance Shares, first, fulfilment of target 1 is required and then the remaining two targets (targets 2 and 3) are weighted 50 per cent each. The number of Share Rights that entitle to awards of shares depends on the extent to which the targets are met in relation to the minimum and maximum levels set for each target. The fact that a target is weighted at 50 per cent means that 50 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares are awarded if the degree of fulfilment for that target reaches the maximum level and the other conditions for an award are met. The “ Performance Period ” means the period from and including 1 May 2025 up to and including 30 April 2028. Target 1 Target 1 consists of the Group’s adjusted EBITA margin. For target 1 to be fulfilled, the Group’s adjusted EBITA margin must amount to at least 5 per cent for the financial year 2027/2028, i.e. the last financial year of the Performance Period. Target 1 constitutes the minimum level that must be reached or exceeded in order for the Share Rights to entitle the Participant to awards of Performance Shares in accordance with targets 2 and 3. Target 2 Target 2 consists of the Group’s average annual adjusted EBITA growth measured over the Performance Period. Target 2 is measured as an average of the outcome for each of the financial years 2025/2026, 2026/2027 and 2027/2028. For the minimum award, which is 20 per cent, under target 2, the average annual adjusted EBITA growth must amount to at least 9 per cent measured over the Performance Period (the minimum level). For a full award under target 2, the average annual adjusted EBITA growth must amount to at least 19 per cent measured over the Performance Period (the maximum level). If the adjusted EBITA margin is below the maximum level but above the minimum level, the award of Performance Shares shall be made in accordance with the threshold levels (cliff-vesting) set out below: Threshold level Share of total number of Performance Shares for the sub-target 9 % 20 % 14 % 50 % 19 % 100 % Target 3 Target 3 consists of the average annual sales growth in existing stores, i.e. excluding newly opened stores, in accordance with the Company’s definition of the key performance indicator, also referred to as like-for-like (“ LFL ”) growth, measured over the Performance Period. Target 3 is measured as an average of the outcome for each of the financial years 2025/2026, 2026/2027 and 2027/2028. For the minimum award, which is 20 per cent, under target 3, the average annual LFL growth must amount to at least 3 per cent measured over the Performance Period (the minimum level). For a full award under target 3, the average annual LFL growth must amount to at least 5 per cent measured over the Performance Period (maximum level). If the LFL growth is below the maximum level but above the minimum level, the award of Performance Shares shall be made in accordance with the threshold levels (cliff-vesting) set out below: Threshold level Share of total number of Performance Shares for the sub-target 3 % 20 % 4 % 50 % 5 % 100 % Design and administration The board of directors shall be responsible for the design and administration of LTIP 2025 within the framework of the terms and conditions and guidelines set out above. In this respect, the board of directors is entitled, inter alia , to determine what, in addition to a direct personal investment, shall be deemed to constitute an investment in the Company’s shares which can be allocated to LTIP 2025 as Savings Shares ( e.g. an investment in shares in the Company made by a Participant within a pension insurance or through a company wholly owned by the Participant). However, the awards of Share Rights and shares shall always be made to a Participant personally. The board of directors shall further be entitled to make adjustments to adhere to specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden or, if delivery of shares to Participants outside of Sweden cannot be completed at reasonable costs and with reasonable administrative efforts, make country-specific adjustments and/or offer cash settlement. The board of directors shall, in case of extraordinary events or if the conditions for the award of Performance Shares are no longer reasonable, be entitled to adjust the minimum level of performance target 1, whereby the adjustment shall aim to maintain an appropriate target level and the overall purpose of LTIP 2025. In the event of significant changes in the Group or its business environment that would render the adopted terms and conditions for the Share Rights under LTIP 2025 no longer appropriate or unreasonable, the board of directors shall also be authorised to make other adjustments. The board of directors shall also have the right to cancel the programme. Before finally determining the number of shares to be awarded under the Share Rights, the board of directors shall assess whether the outcome of LTIP 2025 is reasonable. This assessment shall be made in relation to the Company’s and the Group’s financial results and position, the conditions on the stock market and other considerations. If the board of directors, in its assessment, determines that the outcome is not reasonable, the board of directors shall reduce the number of shares to be awarded. The Company has the right, if so decided by the board of directors, but not the obligation, to withhold and sell, prior to delivery of shares to the Participants, the number of shares required to cover the cost of withholding and paying taxes and social security costs on behalf of the Participants in respect of the Share Rights for transfer to tax authorities. In such case, the net number of shares will be delivered to the Participants after the number of shares has been reduced by the number of shares withheld by the Company for such purposes. In the event of a takeover bid, merger or other similar transaction or event affecting the Company, the board of directors shall be entitled to determine that all or a portion of the Share Rights shall be vested which may result in the early award of shares or that the Share Rights shall be exchanged for new share rights. The board of directors shall be entitled to make such adjustments as may be required due to legal or administrative circumstances, and shall have the right to delegate its rights and obligations in relation to the LTIP 2025 to a remuneration committee or other similar committee of the board of directors. Scope of the programme As set out under the heading “ LTIP 2025 in brief ” above, the maximum number of shares in the Company that may be awarded to participants under LTIP 2025 shall amount to no more than 238,162 shares, corresponding to approximately 0.16 per cent of all shares and votes in the Company. As LTIP 2025 does not lead to an increased number of shares in the Company, no dilution effect in terms of existing shares will arise for the Company’s existing shareholders. The number of shares to which each Share Right entitles to shall, as further determined by the board of directors, be able to be subject to recalculation due to bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits, rights issues or similar corporate events, taking into account customary practice for corresponding types of incentive programmes. Similarly, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded to the Participants under LTIP 2025 may be subject to recalculation due to bonus issues, share splits or reverse share splits, rights issues or similar corporate events, subject to the terms and conditions determined by the board of directors, taking into account customary practice for similar incentive programmes. Costs, hedging measures and effects on key ratios The Company will account for costs based on the fair value of the Share Rights at time of the award, in accordance with IFRS 2. The costs are recorded as personnel costs in the income statement over the Vesting Period. Further, the Participant outcome will give rise to social security costs for the Company. The amount of the social security costs will be calculated based on the development of the share price of the Company’s share during the Vesting Period. Based on assumptions of a share price of SEK 75.5 at the start of the programme and at the award of the Share Rights, that all the Participants offered to participate in the programme participate, that each of them makes the maximum investment and retains their Savings Shares during the Vesting Period, that the employee turnover among the Participants amounts to zero per cent during the Vesting Period, a 100 per cent fulfilment of the performance targets, an increase in share price of 50 per cent from the start of the programme until shares are awarded and unchanged percentages for social security costs, the cost for LTIP 2025 is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 26.5 million, of which approximately SEK 8.5 million constitutes social security costs. In the event of a share price increase of 100 per cent from the start of the programme until shares are awarded, unchanged percentages for social security costs and based on the same assumptions regarding participation and outcome as set out in the paragraph above, the cost of LTIP 2025 is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 29.3 million, of which approximately SEK 11.3 million constitutes social security costs. The cost of LTIP 2025 should be seen in relation to the Group’s total personnel costs, which during the financial year 2024/2025 amounted to approximately SEK 1.9 billion, including social security costs. In order to secure the Company’s commitments under LTIP 2025 and to hedge thereto related costs, the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares as well as a transfer of own shares in accordance with what is set out under item (b) below. Of the number of shares covered by the proposed acquisition authorisation, 74,831 shares are intended to constitute a hedging measure for social security costs that may arise within the framework of LTIP 2025. If a sufficient majority for resolution on authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares as well as transfer of own shares in accordance with item (b) below is not obtained, the board of directors proposes that the board of directors is granted the ability to secure the Company’s obligations under LTIP 2025 by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party, according to which the third party shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares in the Company (including to the Participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of LTIP 2025. If the Company hedges its obligations under LTIP 2025 by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party, costs for such share swap agreement will also be payable. The board of directors is of the opinion that acquisitions and transfers of own shares is preferable to a share swap agreement with a third party as the costs of a share swap agreement are expected to be higher than the costs of carrying out the acquisitions and transfers of own shares. The 238,162 shares that may be awarded to the Participants free of charge may result in a dilution of earnings per share of approximately 0.16 per cent. It is the board of directors’ assessment that the positive effects on the Company’s financial results that are expected due to an increased shareholding among the Participants and the possibility of further awards of shares under LTIP 2025 outweigh the costs related to the programme. Other incentive programmes As of the date of this notice there are two outstanding share-related incentive programmes in the Company, LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024. The participants in both programs were offered to acquire, or allocate already held, shares in the Company as savings shares. Provided that the participants in the programs hold their savings shares for a period of three years and continue to be employed by the Group, the participants will be able to receive 0.5 matching shares per savings share and, if certain performance targets set out in the terms and conditions of programs are met, up to 5 additional performance shares per savings share. Under LTIP 2024, the Company’s CEO is, instead of what is stated regarding the other participants, entitled to receive a maximum of 7 performance shares for each savings share on otherwise the same terms as the other participants but is not entitled to receive any matching shares. The matching shares and the performance shares are shares in the Company which are received free of charge. The number of outstanding share rights amounts to 163,396 for LTIP 2023 and 414,376 for LTIP 2024. For more information regarding the outstanding incentive programmes described above, please see note 12 in the Company’s annual report for the financial year 2024/2025, which will be available at the Company and on the Company’s website ( ) no later than three weeks before the annual general meeting Resolution on (b) authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares and resolution on transfer of own shares Authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions of own shares The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to, during the period until the next annual general meeting, on one or multiple occasions, resolve to acquire own shares as follows: A maximum of 312,993 shares may be acquired. Shares shall be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price per share within the registered price interval at any given time, i.e. the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price, and in accordance with the rules set out in Nasdaq Stockholm’s Rule Book for Issuers applicable at the time. In the case of acquisitions carried out by brokerage firms on behalf of the Company, the price of the shares may, however, correspond to the volume-weighted average price during the period in which the shares were acquired, even if the volume-weighted average price on the date of delivery to the Company is outside the price interval. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. Acquisitions may be made for the purpose of securing the Company’s commitments and costs in connection with LTIP 2025. The number of shares that may be acquired may be recalculated as a result of an intervening bonus issue, share split or reverse share split, rights issue and/or other similar corporate events that affects the number of shares in the Company. However, the maximum number of shares in the Company that may be acquired, after recalculation, shall never exceed 0.20 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company at the time. The board of directors has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19, Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act which will be available at the Company and on the Company’s website ( ). Authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on transfers of own shares The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to, during the period until the next annual general meeting, on one or multiple occasions, resolve on transfers own shares as follows: Transfers of own shares may be made of up to the number of shares that, at any given time, are held by the Company. Own shares may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price per share within the registered price interval at any given time, i.e. the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price, and in accordance with the rules set out in Nasdaq Stockholm’s Rule Book for Issuers applicable at the time. The reason for the board of directors’ proposal is to provide the Company with the opportunity to continuously adapt the number of shares acquired to secure commitments and costs (including social security costs) within the framework of LTIP 2025 and previously implemented incentive programmes. Resolution on transfer of own shares to Participants of LTIP 2025 The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a transfer of own shares in accordance with the following: A maximum of 238,162 shares may be transferred free of charge to the Participants in LTIP 2025. The right to acquire shares free of charge shall, with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights, be granted to the Participants in LTIP 2025. Transfer of shares shall be made free of charge at the time and in accordance with the other terms and conditions on which the Participants in LTIP 2025 are entitled to be awarded shares. The number of shares that may be transferred under LTIP 2025 may be recalculated as a result of an intervening bonus issue, share split or reverse share split, rights issue and/or other similar corporate events affecting the number of shares in the Company. However, the number of shares that may be transferred may never exceed the number of shares held by the Company. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the transfer of the shares is part of the implementation of LTIP 2025. Preparation of the proposal The board of directors’ proposal for a resolution under this item 13 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. The board of directors has decided to submit the proposal to the annual general meeting. MAJORITY REQUIREMENTS A valid resolution under item 13(b) above requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES As of the date of this notice, the total number of shares and votes in the Company amounts to 153,528,969. The Company holds 577,333 own shares as of the date of this notice. SHAREHOLDERS’ RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION The board of directors and the CEO shall, if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the Company, provide information in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda and any circumstances that may affect the assessment of the Company’s financial position. The duty to provide information shall also apply to the Company’s relationship with another group company, the consolidated accounts and such circumstances regarding subsidiaries that are referred to in the preceding sentence. AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS Documentation that shall be made available before the annual general meeting according to the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code will be kept available at the Company’s offices at Kanalvägen 12, SE-194 61 Upplands Väsby, Sweden, and on the Company’s website ( ) no later than three weeks before the annual general meeting. The documents will also be sent without delay and at no cost to the shareholders who request it and state their postal address. Such a request may be sent to the contact information set out under the heading “ Attendance in person or by proxy ” above. The documents will also be available at the annual general meeting. * * * Upplands Väsby in August 2025 Rusta AB (publ) The board of directors Attachments: Notice of annual general meeting in Rusta AB (publ).pdf This email message was delivered to Cancel this subscription This news release was distributed by Company News System, nasdaq.com/european-market-activity/news/company-news"

New Financial Guidance 2025 Revenue DKK 96m-108m (previously DKK 85m-106m) EBITDA DKK 16m-20m EBT DKK 6m-9m The updated guidance now excludes The Ranchers due to uncertainty about the exact release date. The developer is currently finalising a public demo ahead of a Next Fest appearance and an Early Access launch. While builds are progressing well, the pace is slower than expected. The world is now fully built, and the focus has shifted to onboarding and polish before release. As The Ranchers is a premium title, it will not be released early or in an unfinished state. The full player experience must be ready from day one. Preliminary H1 2025 Results (Unaudited) Revenue: DKK 45.3m (H1 2024: DKK 45.4m) EBITDA: DKK 9.7m (H1 2024: DKK 12.5m) EBT: DKK 4.0m (H1 2024: DKK 8.0m) Performance in Q2 2025 exceeded expectations. However, a weaker USD impacted results, as more than half of our sales are USD-based. We see this currency shift as an opportunity to grow market share and have increased marketing budgets for Airline Manager and our new titles Truck Manager and Farm Manager . This reallocation has temporarily paused our buyback program to ensure liquidity. The higher revenue forecast does not immediately translate into higher EBITDA or EBT, as marketing investments typically have a break-even period of 6-12 months. Game Launch Updates The release of Farm Manager and the scaling of Truck Manager remain on track, with both showing potential to become our largest titles. At present, they generate monthly revenues of DKK 2-3m each, supported by significant marketing investment. It is still too early to project their full long-term potential. In Q2 2025, monthly revenue averaged DKK 7.8m. July, driven by Truck Manager and Farm Manager , reached DKK 10.7m, with August expected to be slightly higher - one of the main drivers of this updated guidance. H1 2025 Report In our half yearly report, to be released on August 19th, we will provide KPIs for our games and have additional data for July to help our investors be completely up to date in these exciting times.

Share of Net sales outside Sweden increased to 41% (35) with paying customers in 48 countries. EBIT was MSEK -20.7 (-24.5), with an EBIT margin of -50% (-76). The quarter’s EBIT includes one-off costs of MSEK 3.6 due to organizational restructuring and workforce reductions. Excluding these items, EBIT was -17.1, with a margin of -41%. Net income for the period amounted to MSEK -21.3 (-24.6). Basic earnings per share amounted to SEK -0.75 (-0.96) and diluted to SEK -0.75 (-0.96). Total ARR YoY increased 19% to MSEK 171.2 (143.9). Net New ARR for the second quarter amounted to MSEK 6.6 (9.9). During the quarter cash-flow from current operations amounted to MSEK -0.2 (-8.9). Total cash and cash equivalents amounted to MSEK 67.2 (54.0). January - June 2025 (compared to the same period last year) Net sales increased 28% to MSEK 80.7 (63.3). Share of Net sales outside Sweden increased to 41% (34) with paying customers in 48 countries. EBIT was MSEK -40.1 (-46.0), with an EBIT margin of -50% (-73). The period’s EBIT includes one-off costs of MSEK 3.6 due to organizational restructuring and workforce reductions. Excluding these items, EBIT was -36.5, with a margin of -45%. Net income for the period amounted to MSEK -40.5 (-45.9). Basic earnings per share amounted to SEK -1.43 (-1.82) and diluted to SEK -1.43 (-1.82). Total ARR YoY increased 19% to MSEK 171.2 (143.9). Net New ARR for the first half year amounted to MSEK 12.2 (22.3). Cash-flow from current operations amounted to MSEK -4.3 (-16.4). Total cash and cash equivalents amounted to MSEK 67.2 (54.0). Anders Hamnes, CEO and Founder of Oneflow, comments: “At the end of the second quarter, our Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) reached MSEK 171.2, representing a 19% increase compared to the same period last year. Year-to-date, our ARR was negatively impacted by MSEK 2.6 due to currency fluctuations. Net New ARR for the quarter amounted to MSEK 6.6, compared to MSEK 9.9 in the second quarter last year. We have additionally signed contracts for MSEK 8.1 that will be recognised after the quarter. The primary factors behind our slower growth trend remain consistent: limited expansion sales among existing customers and slightly elevated churn. Our Gross and Net Retention Rates stood at 87.1% (90.8) and 96.7% (107.8) respectively at the end of the quarter. While we are actively strengthening our product strategy, market positioning, and go-to-market execution, we believe that the broader market climate continues to be the most significant limiting factor — a challenge faced by many software companies today. That said, we remain confident in the strength of our platform and the quality of our team. Oneflow continues to offer one of the most advanced and comprehensive contract management solutions on the market, and we are well-positioned to adapt and evolve. Our focus remains on long-term, sustainable progress — we are not chasing short-term wins, but building with intent and resilience. During the second quarter, we restructured parts of our organization as part of our ongoing efforts to build a highly efficient operation. This reorganization resulted in a headcount reduction (with some still in transition) and a one-time cost of MSEK 3.6, which was recognized during the quarter. These changes streamline our operations and position us to enter the third quarter with a clean slate. Responsibilities have been redistributed internally, and we do not expect these changes to negatively impact our sales or overall performance. Our EBIT margin improved to -49.9%, compared to -75.6% in the second quarter last year. EBIT losses for the quarter were MSEK -20.7, or MSEK -17.1 when adjusted for one-time items, corresponding to an EBIT margin of -41.2%. We remain confident in our outlook and expect a significant EBIT improvement in the second half of 2025. As announced on June 23 and approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting on July 9, Oneflow is expanding into North America through a strategic, low-risk initiative. In partnership with board members Lars Appelstål and Bengt Nilsson, who will jointly invest approximately MSEK 15 into the venture, we are forming a new reseller company — Oneflow North America. Oneflow AB will initially hold a 20% stake, with an option to acquire the remaining 80% on favorable terms (see pages 12-13 for full details). This move marks a significant milestone in our global growth journey and provides substantial upside with minimal financial exposure. Our long-term ambition remains to surpass 30% ARR growth while achieving profitability within our existing funding. However, as outlined in our first quarter interim report, we recognize that reaching profitability must take priority in the current environment. This means we will temporarily deprioritize aggressive growth targets until we’ve established a sustainable, profitable foundation — which remains our primary focus and commitment.

Highlights DKK 8.5bn revenue – a 2% decrease DKK 706m EBITDA – a 4% decrease DKK 542m cash flow from operations – a 61% improvement DKK 10.18 earnings per share – a 3% decrease 12.5% ROIC excluding goodwill – a 1.3 pp decrease Full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance narrowed within previous range. Statement by Jens Bjerg Sørensen, President of Schouw & Co. – Schouw & Co. experienced a challenging yet stable second quarter of 2025, with consolidated revenue and EBITDA slightly down on the second quarter of 2024. The diversified portfolio provided stability amid global economic changes, particularly in Chinese export markets. Despite the global challenges, we generated a solid operational cash flow of DKK 542 million. Especially BioMar, GPV and HydraSpecma showed continued solid resilience, while Borg Automotive faced difficult market conditions. We maintain a positive outlook, narrowing our full-year 2025 guidance within the previously announced range. We have previously announced that we are investigating whether a potential separate listing of BioMar would create value for the shareholders of Schouw & Co. The preparatory work continued as expected during the past quarter, and a banking syndicate has been established. If found to be value-creating, the listing of BioMar on the Copenhagen stock exchange can take place in the first half of 2026 .

During the first quarter, we also implemented strategic price adjustments in close dialogue with our customers to ensure long-term profitability and sustainability.

The adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5 per cent (12.0). This means that our profitable and sustainable growth is continuing, as our revenue for the second quarter showed an increase from the preceding quarter and from the corresponding period last year. The operating environment remains unstable. The erratic trade and customs policy of the United States is reflected in uncertainty, especially in consumer-driven demand, which remains weak in spite of lower interest rates. Koskisen has little trade with the US market, so the direct impacts of customs and trade policy are minor. The recovery of the construction sector has also yet to materialise. Although decisions that stimulate demand have been made in Europe, their impact remains small. The profitability of the Sawn Timber Industry segment improved substantially during the second quarter year-on-year, with EBITDA amounting to EUR 4.2 (1.6) million. Shift-specific production in Järvelä developed in line with expectations, and other operational indicators also developed in the right direction. Considering the operating environment and the general situation in the industry, the segment's profit performance remained strong: revenue grew substantially and EBITDA was at a moderate level of approximately 9 per cent in spite of summer-related demand being more subdued than expected. The outlook for the autumn remains broadly uncertain in several markets. The acquisition of the business operations of Iisveden Metsä was completed at the beginning of June. The harmonisation of processes and systems is progressing according to plan: the financial systems have already been integrated, and the integration of production control and wood procurement systems is expected to be completed during the second half of the year. The business acquisition enables us to deliver even greater value to our customers, for example through market-specific product concepts and by centralizing them to the most suitable production facility. The expanded wood procurement area resulting from the acquisition ensures the availability of raw materials and enables organic growth also in the Panel Industry. The acquisition did not yet have a significant impact on revenue or profitability for the quarter under review. We continue to increase the production volume of the new sawmill towards the target of 450,000 m 3 , and we started construction work on the district heating connection pipe between the production plants in Järvelä. The pipe will optimise the operating rate of the power plant situated adjacent to the plywood and chipboard plants, which is currently underutilised. This will enable the continuous production of electricity in the existing power plant and improve the efficiency of heat production. The construction of the connection pipe will allow us to completely avoid a new additional heat investment related to sawmill production, which would otherwise be required at this time to increase drying capacity, which is a bottleneck in production. Wood procurement was carried out according to plan, and wood reserves remained at a good level. The price of wood raw material in the reserve is still at a high level but, towards the end of the quarter under review, it appeared that the peak in price had passed and the purchase price of raw material began to decrease slightly. In the energy wood market, the mild winter was reflected in demand and thus in the revenue and profit performance of the Sawn Timber Industry segment: demand among operators using energy wood was lower than expected, and inventories were higher than in previous years. This will be reflected in slightly lower prices during the coming contract period. The profitability of the Panel Industry segment decreased year-on-year, with EBITDA amounting to EUR 6.7 (8.1) million. Profitability was negatively affected by the increase in wood raw material costs and general production costs. However, in terms of EBITDA, the profitability of the Panel Industry segment was still at a fair level at nearly 16 per cent. The demand for plywood was moderate and picked up towards the end of the quarter, while prices remained stable. The demand for chipboard still reflects the low level of new construction and renovation activity. Chipboard prices have remained somewhat stable, but the profitability of the product category is negatively affected by the high price of wood raw material in particular. The first stage of the investment programme in the Panel Industry segment progressed according to plan, and the first equipment installations were carried out during the summer shutdown in July. The remaining installations will be carried out in stages in September–December, and the equipment will be in production use by the end of the year. The key objective of the investment programme is to improve productivity, quality and yield. The investments made in the first stage of the programme are focused on the automation and modernisation of drying, coating and puttying, among other things. We are continuing to systematically reduce the climate and environmental impacts of our products. In May, we launched Zero ThinPly, a new thin plywood product that is made entirely from bio-based materials. We have also piloted the use of decommissioned wood packaging material from retail and wholesale supply chains — such as pallets — as a raw material for chipboard. Thanks to the recycled wood cleaning process developed during the pilot, wood that was previously directed to incineration can be used as raw material for chipboard, and the end product is as clean and high in quality as products made from virgin wood raw material.

(AIM: FARN, First North: FARON), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on tackling cancers through novel immunotherapies, today announces it has received positive and valuable feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the proposed clinical development plan leading to approval for bexmarilimab , its wholly-owned, novel precision cancer immunotherapy. The feedback was received as part of the Company’s recent BEXMAB study’s end-of-phase 2 (EOP2) meeting with the FDA. The FDA advised Faron to focus on frontline development since possible frontline approval enables use across the entire HR MDS indication. The meeting was requested to gain alignment on the design of a planned registrational phase 2/3 trial evaluating bexmarilimab in combination with azacitidine for patients with treatment-naïve (frontline) higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). Key objectives included obtaining the FDA’s input on the proposed trial design, dosing strategy and clinical endpoints intended to support regulatory approval. Following the FDA's guidance, the trial will begin with a dose optimisation run-in period comparing 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg regimens with placebo, all in combination with azacitidine. Once the optimal dose has been determined, the trial will seamlessly transition into the registrational stage, which includes an interim analysis to support accelerated approval based on IWG 2023 response criteria in frontline patients. “We are extremely encouraged by the collaborative and highly productive dialogue with the FDA, which provided a clear and actionable path for the clinical development of bexmarilimab in frontline HR-MDS, an area of profound unmet medical need,” said Dr. Juho Jalkanen, Chief Executive Officer of Faron. “The agency’s guidance has endorsed a direct route towards accelerated approval using Complete Response (CR) + CR equivalent (CReq) per International Working Group (IWG) 2023 criteria as a co-primary endpoint with Overall Survival (OS). This is a significant step forward in our mission to provide a potentially transformative new treatment option to patients and represents a major regulatory de-risking milestone, as we are now only one study away from getting bexmarilimab approved for the benefit of HR MDS patients.” The FDA confirmed IWG 2023-defined CR + CReq as an acceptable primary endpoint to support an application for accelerated approval in frontline patients. In line with this guidance, Faron will include CR + CReq as a co-primary efficacy endpoint along with Overall Survival (OS) in the phase 2/3 trial. The Company will seek accelerated approval based on an interim readout on the CR + CReq data in frontline patients . Composite complete remission (cCR) will be evaluated as the key secondary endpoint. In addition to the clinical discussion, the FDA was satisfied with Faron’s approach to non-clinical and CMC activities for phase 2/3 and subsequent steps to approval. “Improving outcomes of patients with HR-MDS continues to be a top priority for our field. Bexmarilimab is an antibody with a novel mechanism of action that has demonstrated promising safety and activity in combination with azacitidine in phase 1/2 clinical trials in the first- and second-line settings for HR-MDS,” added Dr. Amer Zeidan, MBBS, MHS, Professor of Medicine at Yale School of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Hematologic Malignancies at Yale Cancer Center and Smilow Cancer Hospital. “I am thrilled that we have agreed with the regulators on a pathway to explore the full potential of bexmarilimab in the frontline setting for patients with HR-MDS. I also would like to highlight the FDA accepting the use of CR+CReq IWG 2023 criteria as part of the primary endpoint, making this the first registrational clinical trial to do so. Many experts, including myself, strongly believe the IWG 2023 criteria to be more patient centric and reflect clinically meaningful benefits to patients in a more robust fashion than the old IWG 2006 criteria, which have been used for all past (and failed) phase 3 clinical trials for HR-MDS,” concluded Dr. Zeidan.

The primary objective is to determine the safety and tolerability of bexmarilimab in combination with SoC (azacitidine) treatment. Directly targeting Clever-1 could limit the replication capacity of cancer cells, increase antigen presentation, ignite an immune response, and allow current treatments to be more effective. Clever-1 is highly expressed in both AML and MDS and associated with therapy resistance, limited T cell activation and poor outcomes. About bexmarilimab Bexmarilimab is Faron’s wholly owned, investigational immunotherapy designed to overcome resistance to existing treatments and optimize clinical outcomes, by targeting myeloid cell function and igniting the immune system. Bexmarilimab binds to Clever-1, an immunosuppressive receptor found on macrophages leading to tumor growth and metastases (i.e. helps cancer evade the immune system). By targeting the Clever-1 receptor on macrophages, bexmarilimab alters the tumor microenvironment, reprogramming macrophages from an immunosuppressive (M2) state to an immunostimulatory (M1) one, upregulating interferon production and priming the immune system to attack tumors and sensitizing cancer cells to standard of care. About Faron Pharmaceuticals Ltd Faron (AIM: FARN, First North: FARON) is a global, clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, focused on tackling cancers via novel immunotherapies. Its mission is to bring the promise of immunotherapy to a broader population by uncovering novel ways to control and harness the power of the immune system. The Company’s lead asset is bexmarilimab , a novel anti-Clever-1 humanized antibody, with the potential to remove immunosuppression of cancers through reprogramming myeloid cell function. Bexmarilimab is being investigated in Phase I/II clinical trials as a potential therapy for patients with hematological cancers in combination with other standard treatments.

The Company is in exclusive negotiations with the shareholder of a research technology business (the “Target”) for the acquisition of the shares in the Target and intends to use the net proceeds from the issuance of the New Bonds, together with cash from balance sheet, to finance such acquisition, which is expected to increase consolidated proforma revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (1) to approximately EUR 310 million and EUR 60 million, respectively, over the last 12 months as per 30 June 2025 (the “Contemplated Acquisition”). The Contemplated Acquisition is expected to complete by early September 2025. Subject to a successful placement, the Subsequent Bonds will initially be issued as separate bonds under an interim ISIN but, upon completion of the Contemplated Acquisition and corresponding release of the proceeds of the Subsequent Bonds, be exchanged for additional bonds under the Company’s up to EUR 125 million senior secured callable floating rate bonds issued on 18 October 2023 (the “Existing Bonds”). Following completion of such mandatory exchange, the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Bonds is expected to be EUR 125 million. The New Bonds will, therefore, be issued under the same terms and conditions as the Existing Bonds and will form a single series with the Existing Bonds from completion of the exchange. (1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as per Aonic’s annual report 2024.

The complete report is attached to this release and available at aspo.com . April–June 2025 Net sales increased to EUR 162.8 (153.5) million Comparable EBITA grew to EUR 9.2 (7.4) million, 5.6% (4.8%) of net sales. The comparable EBITA of ESL Shipping was EUR 5.0 (6.1) million, Telko EUR 4.3 (1.8) million, and Leipurin EUR 1.7 (1.3) million EBITA was EUR 8.9 (6.9) million. EBITA of ESL Shipping was EUR 4.7 (5.9) million, Telko EUR 4.3 (1.7) million, and Leipurin EUR 1.7 (1.0) million Comparable ROE was 16.5% (9.9%) Comparable earnings per share were EUR 0.19 (0.09) Free cash flow was EUR 13.2 (26.4) million driven by investments Aspo repaid the hybrid bond of EUR 30 million and the related interest of EUR 2.6 million in June After the reporting period, on August 15, 2025, Aspo signed an agreement to divest its Leipurin business to Lantmännen at an enterprise value of EUR 63 million. Upon completion, the transaction is estimated to generate a sales gain of approximately EUR 16 million. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and it is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026 January–June 2025 Net sales increased to EUR 314.0 (286.2) million Comparable EBITA grew to EUR 18.0 (12.4) million, 5.7% (4.3%) of net sales. The comparable EBITA of ESL Shipping was EUR 9.1 (8.8) million, Telko EUR 8.7 (4.2) million, and Leipurin EUR 3.1 (2.5) million EBITA was EUR 16.6 (3.9) million. EBITA of ESL Shipping was EUR 7.7 (1.0) million, Telko EUR 8.7 (4.1) million, and Leipurin EUR 3.1 (2.1) million Comparable ROE was 14.3% (8.0%) Comparable earnings per share were EUR 0.31 (0.18) Free cash flow was EUR 8.8 (22.9) million driven by investments Figures from the corresponding period in 2024 are presented in brackets. Guidance for 2025 Aspo Group’s comparable EBITA is expected to be EUR 35 - 45 million in 2025 (EUR 29.1 million in 2024). Aspo Group’s comparable EBITA expectation includes the comparable EBITA of the whole Group, including Leipurin business. The divestment of Leipurin was announced on August 15, 2025. Assumptions behind the guidance Aspo’s operating environment is expected to remain challenging during the second half of the year. Continued geopolitical uncertainty and global trade tensions are expected to have a negative impact on economic growth and global trade. Increased defense and infrastructure spending in Europe may support the economic recovery towards the end of the year. Aspo’s profit improvement for the year is expected to come mainly from the profit generation of the Green Coaster vessels, from Telko’s and Leipurin’s acquisitions completed in 2024, as well as from various intensified profit improvement actions throughout Aspo’s businesses. The higher end of the estimated comparable EBITA range may be realized if all the planned profit improvement measures are successful, and there will be a clear economic recovery during the second half of the year. The lower end of the range may be realized if the economic recovery is further delayed, or significant volumes would be lost or margins impacted negatively due to some unforeseen negative events. Continued trade tensions may have an indirect negative impact on the volumes and price levels of Aspo’s businesses. Direct impacts are expected to be modest. For ESL Shipping, demand is expected to continue weak during the second half of the year, with fairly low contractual volumes combined with low spot market pricing. Volumes are expected to be soft during the third quarter of 2025 and slowly revive towards the end of the year. For Telko, overall stable market development is expected going forward. After successfully completing three acquisitions in 2024, the focus in 2025 is on integrating the acquired companies and securing organic growth and positive profitability development. Acquisition-related expenses are expected to be at a clearly lower level in 2025 than in 2024. For Leipurin, the market is expected to be stable. There continues to be opportunities for growth in the food industry, where the addressable market for Leipurin is multiple compared to the bakery sector. Leipurin remains in a good position to continue improving its profitability.

The figures presented in this half-year financial report have been individually rounded or calculated based on exact figures so the figures may not add to rounded totals and may differ from previously published figures. Rolf Jansson, CEO of Aspo Group, comments on the second quarter of 2025: Profitability improvement is at the top of Aspo’s agenda for the year 2025, taking benefit of the completed acquisitions and capex investments made during previous years. Currently, we do not build our plans on a significant positive impact from a recovery of the economy during the second half of the year 2025. Market uncertainty has increased, shortening customer planning horizons and slowing down industrial activity. With this in mind, we place even further emphasis on executing a wide range of actions to improve profitability across all Aspo’s businesses. Despite the challenging market, Aspo continued to grow and improve its profitability during the second quarter of 2025. Aspo’s net sales grew by 6.0% compared to the second quarter of 2024 and the comparable EBITA was EUR 9.2 million compared to EUR 7.4 million in the corresponding period in the previous year. I am proud of Aspo team for generating continued profit growth despite the current market circumstances. ESL Shipping’s comparable EBITA was EUR 5.0 (6.1) million. ESL Shipping’s profitability was negatively impacted by the continued very weak spot market and softer than expected forest industry demand. On the positive side, steel industry activity remained at a healthy level and the project cargo market offered new freight opportunities. ESL Shipping has six new electric hybrid Green Coaster vessels in operation, and the fleet renewal has already considerably improved energy efficiency and competitiveness. Telko’s comparable EBITA of EUR 4.3 (1.8) million more than doubled primarily due to the contribution of acquisitions completed in 2024, as well as the absence of M&A costs. Telko has improved its product and service mix leading to growth in sales margin. In July 2025, Telko achieved a Gold Medal in the Ecovadis sustainability rating. Leipurin’s comparable EBITA was was record-high at EUR 1.7 (1.3) million. Leipurin’s profitability improvement relates specifically to Sweden, including the acquisition made in 2024, organic growth and measures to improve supply chain efficiency. When summing up the first half of year 2025, Aspo achieved net sales growth of 9.7% and the comparable EBITA was EUR 18.0 million compared to EUR 12.4 million in the corresponding period previous year. All businesses improved their profitability with very limited support from the market, showing that company actions have been successful. After the review period, on August 15, 2025, Aspo announced the divestment of Leipurin to Lantmännen. This transaction is estimated to generate a sales gain of approximately EUR 16 million which will strengthen the balance sheet of Aspo and support the compounder strategy of Telko. This is a major step in executing Aspo’s vision and the transaction is a result of a very successful transformation of Leipurin during the past couple of years. Instrumental in this transformation were an increased focus on food ingredients, a complete shift from “East to West”, major organic and non-organic growth investments, and company-wide profit improvement efforts. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and it is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026. Our short-term focus lies on profitability improvement, benefitting from the Green Coaster investments made, the acquisitions completed during 2024, and the vast array of profitability improvement efforts ongoing across the Group. In the longer term, we continue to make progress in reaching the financial ambition of Aspo as well as our vision, creating two separate companies out of Aspo, namely Aspo Infra (ESL Shipping) and Aspo Compounder (Telko). The divestment of Leipurin is a major step in executing this vision along with Telko's already completed M&A activities and ESL Shipping's significant investments in best-in-class vessels. Financial performance and targets Aspo’s long-term financial targets are: Minimum increase in net sales: 5–10% a year Comparable EBITA of 8% Return on equity: more than 20% Net debt to comparable EBITDA, rolling 12 months ratio below 3.0 At a business level, ESL Shipping’s long-term comparable EBITA target is 14%, Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. In January–June 2025, Aspo’s net sales grew by 9.7% to EUR 314.0 (286.2) million. The comparable EBITA rate stood at 5.7% (4.3%). Comparable return on equity was 14.3% (8.0%) and the net debt to comparable EBITDA, rolling 12 months ratio was 3.7 (2.0).

EBITDA was DKK 9.7m, a 23% YoY decrease. EBT was DKK 4.0m, a 50% YoY decrease. Unique paying users (UPU) were 222,158, a 17% YoY increase. Total transactions were 638,570, a 20% YoY increase. Total installs were 16.9m, a 114% YoY increase. Q2 Revenue was DKK 23.6m, a 7.5% YoY decrease. EBITDA was DKK 3.5m, a 55% YoY decrease. EBT was DKK 0.03m, a 99% YoY decrease. Unique paying users (UPU) were 137,457, a 18% YoY increase. Total transactions were 347,268, a 17% YoY increase. Total installs were 7.8m, a 60% YoY increase. Building Momentum The second quarter of 2025 was marked by strong operational focus, delivering results in line with expectations while laying the groundwork for accelerated growth in the second half of the year. Activities intensified from mid-May, with the scale-up of Truck Manager , followed by the late-June release of Farm Manager . While these milestones had only a limited direct impact on Q2 Financials, they have already had a clear effect on top-funnel KPIs creating a clear shift in momentum. July 2025 thus marked a historic milestone with revenue of DKK 10.7 million - the highest in company history. The early scaling of both titles is already exceeding expectations, building powerful momentum and positioning Trophy Games for a record-breaking second half of the year. Temporary Pressures for Long-Term Gains In Q2, we invested DKK 2 million more in marketing compared to last year, primarily to launch campaigns for Truck Manager and Farm Manager. As these campaigns began late in the quarter, the cost impact was immediate, while the revenue benefit will materialise in Q3 and beyond. It’s worth noting that Q2 2024 benefited from an exceptional - but temporary - boost in iOS marketing payback, with campaigns performing three times above normal levels . This one-off advantage makes year-on-year comparisons less straightforward. In addition, a weakened USD - down nearly 15% since January - impacted both our revenue and operating profit as more than half of our sales are directly or indirectly influenced by movements in the USD. We also faced a one-time financial expense of DKK 990 thousand in tax interest payments, due to the Danish Tax Authority’s retrospective withdrawal of the Tax Credit Scheme (Skattekreditordningen) for software development. This ruling impacted thousands of Danish IT companies. For Trophy Games, the impact is a short-term liquidity drain, but we expect to offset this through tax loss carryforward already in the 2025 income year. The combination of these factors, along with our ability to scale marketing faster than initially projected, led to a temporary pause of the share buyback program in Q2. With marketing campaigns typically breaking even within six months, even modest monthly increases in spend can significantly influence liquidity in the short term. Stronger Outlook Driven by Early Success Our focus on Truck Manager and Farm Manager is already reshaping our KPIs. From installs to active engagement and paying user numbers, these two titles have delivered a notable uplift. Updated figures including July clearly show a stronger Q3 outlook compared to Q2. This acceleration in topline growth is why we chose to revise our guidance early and share preliminary figures that include July and early August. The Ranchers Our French studio partner Redpilz is working intensively to complete the first public demo of The Ranchers . Once ready, the sequence will be: demo release, participation in Steam’s Next Fest , followed by an Early Access launch . For a premium PC title, day-one quality is critical - there is no margin for a “soft” launch. That’s why polishing and player testing are non-negotiable. The demo is arriving later than planned, introducing uncertainty around the release date. To safeguard quality, we have removed The Ranchers from our current guidance. The release is approaching, but we will not compromise on delivering a first-class player experience. Positioned for a Record-Breaking H2 2025 With two high-potential titles scaling rapidly , KPIs moving sharply upward, and July already delivering a company-record revenue, Trophy Games enters the second half of 2025 with an exciting outlook. While short-term liquidity has been impacted by targeted investments in development, marketing and one-off expenses, these actions are designed to secure sustainable, scalable growth . Our strategy remains focused: invest decisively in our most promising titles, ensure quality in all releases, and build long-term shareholder value. As these initiatives bear fruit, we see compelling upside ahead - both for our games and for our investors. Thank you for your continued support.

EBITDA was down by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million, and profit before tax (EBT) was down by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million. As announced on 10 July 2025, our full-year revenue guidance for 2025 has been lowered to a range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%), while our earnings margin guidance is maintained at an EBITDA margin of 19-21% and an EBT margin of 11-13%. We therefore expect to achieve revenue and earnings at the same level as the record year of 2024. The Board of Directors of SP Group A/S today considered and approved the interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2025, which includes the following highlights (all changes are calculated in relation to the first half of 2024): Revenue fell by 1.2% to DKK 1,466.9 million in H1. Revenue for Q2 was down by 10.7% year on year. Earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million in H1 for an EBITDA margin of 19.8%. EBITDA for Q2 was down by 18.8% to DKK 124.8 million for an EBITDA margin of 18.3%. Profit before tax (EBT) fell by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million in H1 for an EBT margin of 11.2%. EBT for Q2 was down by 30.6% to DKK 63.6 million for an EBT margin of 9.4%. H1 sales of own products declined by 11.5% to DKK 388.4 million. Own products accounted for 26.5% of revenue for the period. Sales of other products grew in H1, while Healthcare, Foodtech and Cleantech suffered a setback. Cash flows from operating activities were a net inflow of DKK 228.7 million in H1 against DKK 256.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 756.9 million at 30 June 2025, compared to DKK 923.8 million at 30 June 2024. At 31 December 2024, NIBD amounted to DKK 821.1 million. NIBD was 1.3x LTM EBITDA. NIBD fell by DKK 64.2 million in H1 2025. SP Meditec is nearing completion of its production ramp-up in Peachtree City, near Atlanta, USA. Due to a high number of customer projects, we are currently exploring options to expand production capacity further. In Poland, we have initiated the conversion of one of our factory buildings for the manufacturing of components for medical devices. Ergomat has successfully launched new sales activities in Asia, including in key markets such as India and Japan. We expect only marginal impact from a new US–EU trade agreement. SP Group expects revenue growth for FY 2025 in the range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%) for an EBITDA margin of 19-21%. Lars Bering, CEO: “ Following a record-breaking first quarter in terms of revenue and earnings, SP Group generated lower-than-expected sales and earnings in the second quarter of 2025 due to the postponement of several orders and projects during the period. The Q2 performance was impacted by ongoing geopolitical unrest, leading to increased uncertainty in global markets with several of our customers postponing the launch of new projects. However, we are pleased to see increased activity in the defence industry, which has led to several exciting projects for SP. Our subsupplier production grew in the course of H1 2025, as did the inflow of medical device industry projects, resulting in high activity levels at our US factory and the factories in Europe. ” For further information: CEO Lars Bering Phone: +45 70 23 23 79 Invitation: Presentation of interim report for the first half of 2025 In continuation of the release of this interim report, SP Group will host a webcast on 20 August 2025 at 1:00 p.m. (in Danish) and at 3:00 p.m. (in English).

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year. Free cash flow in Q2 was DKK 32 million, compared to DKK 26 million in Q2 2024. This improvement was driven by higher earnings and an improvement in the net working capital. CAPEX amounted to DKK 18.3 million (Q2 2024: DKK 12.0 million), mainly related to the ERP project and the new lacquering facility. The lacquering facility was completed during the quarter and is expected to ramp up fully during the present quarter. After acquiring 45% of the online retailer Celebert ApS in 2021, we have now agreed to acquire the remaining 55% following the decision of the majority shareholder to exercise its put option. During the four years of co-ownership, Celebert has grown rapidly, and we are confident that, once the relevant regulatory approvals are in place, Celebert will continue this growth journey. Considering the results from the first six months of the year and the development in order intake during Q2, we are narrowing our guidance for 2025. TCM Group now expects full-year revenue in the range of DKK 1,250–1,300 million (previously DKK 1,250 – 1,325 million) and adjusted EBIT of DKK 90–110 million (previously DKK 90-115 million).

Immunovia’s commercial strategy builds on scalable growth through multiple phases: initial focused investments in KOLs to establish trust and advocacy, followed by expanded selling efforts targeting broader audiences, with parallel initiatives to reach commercial partnerships and secure payer reimbursement in the second half of 2026. Below is an overview of the three-phase strategic rollout of PancreaSure 2025-2027: Targeted Advocacy : Initially, Immunovia will focus on key opinion leaders and the 200 high-risk pancreatic cancer surveillance programs in the US. Immunovia will use a targeted, low-cost approach to build advocacy by leveraging the company’s existing relationships within the pancreatic cancer community. Volume Building : Then, Immunovia will aim to partner with a strategic commercial ally to expand reach and drive adoption among other practitioners and specialists, while building volume among existing users. Revenue Growth : Finally, with the support of a commercial partner, Immunovia will increase testing volume within all target groups and secure payer coverage to drive revenue. At launch, physicians at high-risk pancreatic cancer surveillance centers will implement the PancreaSure test by placing an order in Immunovia’s online portal. The high-risk individual’s blood will be drawn and then sent to the Immunovia lab in North Carolina. After processing, PancreaSure test results will be shared with the physician in the online portal. PancreaSure will initially be available as a patient-pay test at the list price of $995. Patients who pay promptly can lower the cost of the test to $750. Immunovia will offer a financial assistance program to lower the cost of the PancreaSure test for those with financial need. Through the financial assistance program, the cost of the test is determined by the patient’s ability to pay and can be $0, $100 or $200. Immunovia plans to begin billing insurance for the PancreaSure test in 2026. For further information, please contact Jeff Borcherding, CEO Immunovia in brief Immunovia AB is a diagnostic company whose mission is to increase survival rates for patients with pancreatic cancer through early detection. Immunovia is focused on the development and commercialization of simple blood-based testing to detect proteins and antibodies that indicate a high-risk individual has developed pancreatic cancer. Immunovia collaborates and engages with healthcare providers, leading experts and patient advocacy groups to make its test available to individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. USA is the world’s largest market for detection of pancreatic cancer. The Company estimates that in the USA, 1.8 million individuals are at high-risk for pancreatic cancer and could benefit from annual surveillance testing.

Q2 gross margin of 45%, level with Q2 2024 Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $82 thousand, compared with $239 thousand in Q2 2024 Liquid Cooling revenue of $9.8 million, up from $8.6 million in Q1 2025 and compared with $11 million in Q2 2024 SimSports revenue in line with expectations at $1.3 million following the U.S. import tariff announcements in April, compared with $1.7 million in Q2 2024 First-half 2025 revenue of $21.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.2 million compared with $24.9 million and positive $0.2 million in first-half 2024, respectively Group revenue expectation for 2025 is maintained in the range of $45 to $53 million with adjusted EBITDA at 0% to 3%. Asetek reported second-quarter revenue of $11.2 million compared with $12.7 million in the same period of 2024. First-half 2025 revenue was $21.0 million compared with $24.9 million in the first half of 2024. The change in both periods mainly reflects fewer shipments of liquid cooling products. Gross margin was level at 45% for both the second quarter and first half of 2025 and the respective periods of 2024. “Amidst continued macro uncertainties, Asetek experiences strong momentum with new and existing Liquid Cooling customers led by innovative products for a wider market, focused commercial work and a growing recognition of our quality, established supply chain and full service offering in volatile markets. This week, we are launching our Initium mass-market sim racing product portfolio at Gamescom in Germany, significantly widening our addressable market. Within both our segments, we are positioned to deliver long-term profitable growth when markets stabilize,” says André S. Eriksen, the CEO of Asetek. Adjusted EBITDA was $82 thousand in the second quarter of 2025, compared with $239 thousand in the second quarter of 2024. First-half 2025 adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.2 million, compared with positive $0.2 million in the same period of 2024. To strengthen the Company’s financial position and enable continued investments in the SimSports segment, Asetek completed an equity rights offering in January, raising net proceeds of $10.3 million through the issuance of 219.9 million new common shares. During the first half of 2025, the Company invested $0.5 million in property and equipment and $1.4 million in capitalized costs for the development of new products. At June 30, 2025, Asetek had working capital of $11.3 million, including $7.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. OPERATIONS In May, the Company announced the launch of Ingrid, a new platform-based liquid cooling solution engineered to deliver superior thermal performance, reduced acoustic footprint, and platform-level flexibility for both partners and PC builders. The Ingrid product line offers a newly engineered pump, smart thermal sensing, and a new level of B2B configurability not previously available in all-in-one coolers. In June, Asetek announced a new customer agreement with Antec, a global leader in high-performance computer components, marking the first delivery of mainstream liquid cooling products based on Asetek’s new platform. The agreement includes Antec’s new Vortex View AIO liquid cooler and deliveries are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Asetek announced the launch of its Forte Formula Pro Steering Wheel, a fully customizable high-performance sim racing wheel that offers immersive display technology, precise input control, and lightweight durability. OUTLOOK In the second half of 2025, Asetek plans launches of new products in both Liquid Cooling and SimSports – including liquid cooling products designed for the mid-market. The initial mass-market sim racing products will launch this week at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, and the first console-supported SimSports offering is expected in late 2025 or early 2026. The Group outlook is maintained at revenue of $45 to $53 million and adjusted EBITDA of 0% to 3% of revenue for 2025. The outlook reflects the expected impact on SimSports revenues from the tariffs implemented by the U.S. government on imports from other countries, most significantly related to products made in China. Asetek expects Liquid Cooling revenue growth to return in 2026 supported by the recent measures to strengthen management, new products widening the addressable market, focused commercial work yielding new customers and closer collaboration with the existing base.

Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy.

Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3.

Reported revenue in DKK grew 1% with negative impact from currencies and the Skin Care divestment. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy. Growth in Advanced Wound Dressings was -2%, driven primarily by a significant decline in China which was impacted by a preventative and voluntary product return of all Biatain® Adhesive foam dressings in the market. The product return is expected to have a negative revenue impact of around DKK 80 million in H2, of which around DKK 20 million impacted Q3. Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3.

Guidance for 2025 (changed 18 August 2025) Netum estimates its revenue in the financial year 2025 to be in the range of EUR 37–41 million and comparable EBITA to be 4–7% of revenue. Previous guidance: Netum estimates its revenue in the financial year 2025 to be in the range of EUR 41–46 million and comparable EBITA to be 7–10% of revenue. The changed guidance is based on the very unclear market situation, slower than expected wins of sales and delayed project starts, which have not been able to compensate for the previously anticipated completion of a few large projects at the end of the summer. The changes in the Group apply especially to Netum Oy and Buutti Oy. Netum estimates that the demand for IT in public service will remain stable, but the fierce price competition will weaken the profitability of the projects. In the private sector, the opportunities are good if uncertainty eases, and investments pick up. The outlook remains unclear, and we will assess the necessary operational and structural changes during the autumn. Repe Harmanen, CEO: “The first half of the year was challenging for our business. Falling short of the sales targets for the first half of the year was reflected in both revenue and profit. Our revenue in January–June was EUR 21.4 (22.8) million and comparable EBITA was EUR 1.7 (2.3) million, or 7.8% (10.1%). The continued uncertainty in the market and the slowdown in investments have forced us to take several measures to safeguard profitability. We will monitor the adequacy of the measures and strengthen our resilience with determination. During the first half of the year, Netum Ltd carried out change negotiations, which ended on 18 June 2025. The measures implemented as a result of the negotiations will improve our cost efficiency and adapt our operations to the market situation. The personnel reductions are estimated to result in about EUR 1.9 million of permanent savings on an annual basis, but their impact will not be fully visible until 2026. EUR 0.1 million of the costs of implementing the change negotiations has been taken into account in the comparable EBITA for the second quarter, and the remaining EUR 0.2 million will be allocated to the third quarter of the year. At the same time, we have secured new customers and projects that will start in the autumn and support our future growth. During the summer, the largest tenders won were the construction and maintenance of the farm relief system for the Farmers' Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Mela) (estimated at EUR 4 million, 7 years) and expert services for the development of railway information systems for the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (estimated at EUR 1.6 million, 3 + 2 years). During the first half of the year, Buutti’s business in particular clearly fell short of its targets, which had the most significant impact on our revenue and profit. Studyo’s business was in line with the targets. Despite Netum Ltd’s add-on sales and profits from new projects, we are still behind our sales target for this year. It is of primary importance for us to continue to be successful in tenders in the near future in order to compensate for the decline in our revenue and profitability caused by significant ending projects. For example, the transfer of employment services from the central government to municipalities required extensive development projects and the parallel use of systems. We played a significant role in the project, both in system development and production. Following successful deployments in the first half of the year, we will continue as the vendor in the same roles, but with a smaller volume during the rest of the year. I have met several of our customers from different sectors. The meetings have highlighted confidence in our ability to implement business-critical solutions even in an uncertain market. Our customers particularly appreciate the high level of expertise of our experts and the transparency of our solutions - these factors set us apart in the intense competition. Our people have demonstrated excellent commitment and flexibility in the midst of change. I would like to thank everyone at Netum for their high-quality work and for building our future competitiveness. I wish all the best to those who were involved in the change negotiations and believe that there is a shared understanding of the company’s situation. Competence development and the wellbeing of our personnel will continue to be the foundation of our long-term success. Our strategically important AI project is progressing as planned, and we have seen a growing demand for AI solutions that reform processes. In line with our Wise Changemaker mindset, we help customers to leverage AI in existing systems and build new digital capabilities, strengthening our position as a responsible and long-term IT partner. Our sustainability programme and the preparation of the CSRD project are progressing according to schedule. For us, sustainability is about practical actions and transparent communication that support the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders. We estimate that the demand for IT services will continue at the current level, but the fierce price competition will continue to challenge sufficient margin levels. The fast-paced nature of Buutti Oy's expert services may have a faster impact for the numbers of the rest of the year than Netum Ltd's business model. The current market environment requires close monitoring and flexibility. We are prepared to take the necessary measures if the market situation changes substantially or if the start of projects deviates from the current forecast. We will continue our determined work on profitability and growth in Finland and in accordance with our strategy in the Nordic countries. I would like to express my warmest thanks to our customers, employees and other stakeholders.” For further information, please contact: Netum Group Plc Repe Harmanen, CEO +358 400 467 717 Mari Ala-Sorvari, Head of external reporting and IR +358 50 494 9930 Certified Adviser: Evli Plc +358 40 579 6210 Netum Group Plc Netum is an IT service partner that builds a functional and secure digital society.

It is encouraging to see our business units working together, both locally and cross-border, to strengthen our product- and solution-driven go-to-market approach. This is beginning to be reflected in our numbers. In the first half of 2025, our product-based segment, Run, grew revenue by 59.4% and accounted for 33.6% of total revenue. Revenue from our in-house IP grew by 25.8%, supported by increased demand for our sovereign, secure, and resilient datacenter solutions in our subsidiary Netic. Our public sector business delivered solid growth of 19.1% in the first six months and now represents 39.7% of revenue. We won 11 out of 13 tenders during the period, and our teams are focused on applying our high win rate to a significantly larger volume of opportunities in the coming years. In Q2, we announced two new public digital health engagements in Switzerland and Oman, as well as the Digital Identity Wallet contract in Denmark. The profitability in the first half of the year was negatively affected by one-off costs related to the rightsizing initiatives and large pre-sales efforts. As previously communicated, the benefits will be backloaded into the second half of the year. Combined with our overall visibility and expectations, we maintain the financial guidance for 2025.” Second quarter 2025 Trifork Group In Q2/2025, Trifork Group revenue amounted to EURm 55.1, a net increase of 5.1% from Q2/2024, the combined result of an organic growth of 2.9% and an inorganic growth of 2.2%.

Adjusted for EUR 4.6m higher hardware and third-party licenses compared to Q2/2024, revenue growth was 18.4%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.9% (Q2/2024: 19.2%). Trifork Labs In Q2/2025, fair value adjustment of Trifork Labs investments was EURm 0.7 (Q2/2024: EURm 1.2) At 30 June 2025, the book value of active Labs investments amounted to EURm 84.4 (30 June 2024: EURm 76.7).

The webcast can be accessed via the following link: or via the OssDsign website. The second quarter in figures Net sales amounted to TSEK 46,522 (29,737), which translates to a growth of 73% compared to the second quarter of 2024 at constant exchange rates, or 56% in reported figures. It also constitutes an underlying quarter-on-quarter growth of 16% compared to Q1, partly due to the Q2 numbers being somewhat inflated by last day orders. Maintained solid gross margin of 96,8% compared to 93.2% in the same quarter in the previous year and even somewhat higher than in the previous quarter (96.4%). Adjusted EBIT of TSEK -6,203 (-15,295). Marginally lower than in Q1, this normalized EBIT continues at an encouraging level. The negative exchange rate effect on sales is almost entirely off-set in operating expenses, marginally affecting the operating result. Adjusted for LTIP/warrant related costs, operating expenses were somewhat up on the previous quarter, partly driven by the higher sales and partly by temporary regulatory project costs. In relative terms, commissions were lower than in the previous quarter. EBIT (reported) of TSEK -6,936 (-15,295). Loss after taxes amounted to TSEK 8,340 (15,688). Earnings per share stable at SEK -0.1 (-0.2). Cash flow from operating activities of TSEK -11,895 (-18,449) was also negatively affected by LTIP/warrant related costs through the operating result (MSEK -0.7), but to a greater extent by the net working capital development towards the end of the quarter. A receivables increase as a logical consequence of the increase in sales, coupled with an intentional inventory build in preparation for further sales acceleration. Below operating activities, cash flow from investments showed initial signs of the higher investment level in the updated strategic plan. Financing activities were dominated by the approximate MSEK +150 net proceeds from the very successful June capital raise. The first half year in figures Net sales amounted to TSEK 91,016 (56,766), which translates to a growth of 66% compared to the first half year of 2024 at constant exchange rates, or 60% in reported figures. Gross margin of 96,6% for the first half year, compared to 93.4% for the same period in the previous year. Adjusted EBIT of TSEK -11,766 (-27,329), demonstrating a new sustainable level. Marginal negative exchange rate effect due to the positive USD/SEK in the first quarter, almost off-setting the USD decline in Q2, as well as the exchange rate effect on operating expenses almost off-setting the corresponding effect on sales. Adjusted for LTIP/warrant related costs, operating expenses were higher than last year, driven almost entirely by sales variable costs. In relative terms, commissions were lower than in the previous year. EBIT (reported) of TSEK -19,633 (-27,328). Loss after taxes amounted to TSEK 22,917 (26,836). Earnings per share of SEK -0.2 (-0.3). Cash flow from operating activities of TSEK -37,769 (-46,652), where the LTIP/warrant related costs, primarily in Q1, and year-end bonus payments, also in Q1, weighed negatively on cash flow by approximately MSEK -18. The inventory build-up in the period is deliberate and receivables mainly an effect of the higher sales in Q2.

CEO STATEMENT Dear Shareholders, Team Teneo.ai and Partners, The second quarter 2025 marks another strong growth in Y-O-Y numbers and some significant milestones in our focus on new customer engagements, with a doubled pipeline Q-o-Q. The M&A market has also heated up during the summer with some large investments and acquisitions that prove to us and customers that the Teneo hybrid ML, LLM is the right AI solution for Voice. Market Overview The mindshare of OpenAI has been deafening in the last few years. Sam Altman’s predictions gain more headlines than wars. This has led to all our customers experimenting with companies that provide wrappers on top of LLM´s. This is different than our approach – we use proprietary technology in Teneo to understand what customers are calling about. This technology is based on traditional Machine Learning as well as Small Language Models and in the development of the customer solution Large Language Models are used. Newly minted companies that have seen a lot of investments and gained attention such as Sierra.ai use only Large Language Models. In July we saw an acquisition that validates our approach. Cognigy, was acquired in July by NiCE (number two in Contact Center Software) at a valuation of 26 times sales including Professional Services. Total purchase price of 955 MUSD. Their technology is a platform using deterministic models just like ours. NiCE could of course have acquired any of the LLM wrapper companies at a much lower price but chose to acquire a comprehensive platform. This proves that to really have impact in the Contact Center you need to use deterministic technologies rather than only Large Language Models. Customers are slowly arriving at the same conclusion. We are currently engaged in three proofs of concepts where we see great increases in accuracy with our approach. The pure LLM players are currently increasing the sales cycle but luckily LLM´s are also more expensive to use in production so this does not increase price pressure. When considering Enterprise features such as security, accuracy, and performance Teneo remains uniquely positioned in the market, effectively managing high-volume telephony operations and automating up to 91% of incoming calls (more on this new number below), offering unmatched efficiency and reliability. Teneo.ai has a large proportion of our business with US customers. The company maintains a stable outlook, with no immediate risks aside from currency exchange rates identified from current U.S. administrative actions or proposed economic measures, including toll tariffs. Sales Cycles have increased as many customers are restrictive with investments in an uncertain environment. The positive side of the current development for Teneo is an increased focus on cost reductions which increases the interest in adding AI Agents into the workforce. Pipeline Development Sales and Marketing in the second quarter 2025 prioritized qualifying the opportunities created in the first quarter 2025 and putting focus on the closeable opportunities. We also broadened our geographical focus to include Turkey where we see interest in our solutions. Partnerships Two important additional partnerships were signed during the second quarter 2025. EBO.ai, a company focused on automation that delivers to the same National Healthcare unit that CGI and we renewed the agreement just after the second quarter 2025. Together we are building a role model hospital contact center built on Teneo in the Middle East that we also will be showcasing to UK and US prospects. By combining EBO´s healthcare trained AI models with Teneo we will be able to increase patient access and satisfaction while freeing up valuable care resources. We also welcome FGS as a partner. FGS is part of the Vodafone group and has a very strong presence in Turkish Enterprises. Their local knowledge combined with a strong Turkish enterprise interest in using AI to automate Customer Care make this ideal for Teneo collaboration and we already have several joint opportunities we are addressing. Analysts In the Contact Center space there is an analyst that is trusted by more enterprises than any other. That is DMG Consulting. In the DMG Consulting's 2025 enterprise report where we participated for the first time, Teneo.ai earned perfect customer satisfaction scores across seven key areas, including implementation, pricing, and overall vendor satisfaction. This achievement is particularly significant because it's based on feedback from actual enterprise customers, validating Teneo's voice-first agentic AI platform for contact center automation. The perfect scores underscore the Teneo´s ability to deliver value through high accuracy rates and substantial operational cost savings. For Teneo, this recognition solidifies our position as a trusted and leading partner in a competitive market, where customer satisfaction is a critical differentiator. Customer Feedback Our Teneo is the only tool that has the accuracy and performance to actually replace people answering the phone. In the second quarter 2025, we got this confirmed by one of our very large customers. This customer has 10 million inbound calls per month. In order to serve these customers correctly the most important component is understanding why they are calling. This is called Natural Language Understanding. This is the step that entails both the accuracy in transcribing speech to text and then parsing understanding from this text. In this customer the understanding was 99% - which is much better than any other solution. But even more importantly 91% of all calls were manged by Teneo instead of a human leading to higher customer satisfaction. That is 9.1 million automated calls per month. Astonishing ROI! Strategic Sales Events During second quarter 2025, we have focused on developing the opportunities that we created in the first quarter 2025. We have moved six to qualified, three into proposal sent and we have three in the stage Pilot/POC. This means that we are progressing our opportunities and focusing the work on closing. The pipeline almost doubled to 2 MEUR in weighted numbers primarily due to the progression of our opportunities. Our new sales pipeline is measured as a 12-month subscription value, excluding future API calls—though API calls make up most of our revenue. The pipeline is weighted based on the sales stage of each opportunity and does not include additional revenue from existing customers. For example, consider a sales opportunity for a new customer similar to one of our large existing clients. If this opportunity is in the *qualified* sales stage, it would be valued at: 9,900 times 12 months times 20% (weight for qualified stage) = approximately 24,000 EUR. While the long-term potential revenue from such a customer could be 3.5 MEUR per year, our pipeline reflects only 24,000 EUR at this stage. Since our first quarter 2025 report, our weighted pipeline has again almost doubled to 2 045 000 EUR from 1 050 000 EUR in our first quarter 2025 report. Our pipeline progression this quarter is mostly driven by our opportunities moving up in sales stages thereby increasing the probability of closing. We have fewer opportunities in total as we have qualified out some of the created opportunities in the first quarter 2025. The remaining pipeline includes major enterprises across various sectors, driven by factors such as the discontinuation of Nuance (the foundation for traditional keypad navigation systems) and our partnership with Genesys and the associated eco system. Our first opportunity where AWS has engaged together with our partner Cloudhesive is also a promising development opening up more avenues for pipeline development. Preparation for Teneo 8 rollout During the third quarter 2025 we will be rolling out the biggest update to our Teneo ever. The details will be released at a later stage during the quarter. In preparation for this we have been pushing legacy, chat only customers to accept upgrading to the new codebase. We delivered a record gross margin of 88% in the second quarter 2025, but in order to further bring up our gross margin we want all customers to use one and the same codebase. Customers that use chat only in Teneo do not see the value in the solutions as does a voice customer and therefore those that are not able to move to voice will likely not be moving to the new codebase. In our forward looking ARR metric we have taken this into account. Those customers are costly for us to serve and the functionality we are pushing in the new release is very important for our enterprise voice prospects and customers. Last quarters change in how we operate our SaaS has brought the cost savings and associated higher Gross Margin as projected. Autumn focus Looking ahead we have the partnerships and pipeline to deliver on our goal to hit 20 MUSD ARR within the first quarter 2026. Selling to large enterprises involves many stakeholders and many hoops to go through. Once we are in the process, we see that our message resonates and when we have the chance to prove our technology we never fail. We have enough qualified opportunity to reach our goal – now its closing focus. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated team, our valued partners, and exceptional customers for their continued collaboration. And of course, to our shareholders who continue to support us on this journey! Thank you all for your continued support and confidence.

EBIT margin reached 15.5 percent, down 3.2 percentage points compared to Q2 2024, mainly due to higher depreciations related to investments and write-downs related to the Trondheim, Norway factory closure. The 2024 acquisitions had limited impact on the EBIT margin. Investments totalled 187 MEUR in H1 2025, of which the largest projects related to the production capacity expansion in Romania, the new factory in North America, and electrification of existing production lines as well as digitalisation. Cash flow from operations before financial items and tax amounted to 323 MEUR in H1 2025 compared to 394 MEUR last year.

EBIT margin is expected to be below 16 percent, changed from previously around 16 percent. Investments around 450 MEUR excluding acquisitions. CEO comment Commenting on the Group’s performance, CEO Jes Munk Hansen says: “Considering the difficult market conditions and the geopolitical uncertainties, we expect our full-year revenue to be at level with last year and our EBIT margin to be below 16 percent. Although volumes declined in some markets and growth slowed in others, we delivered overall acceptable revenue and profitability for H1 2025. The technical insulation business continued to perform well as did several European markets, including the UK, Spain, Italy, and Romania. Several other markets including the Nordics experienced double-digit sales declines. Notwithstanding the near-team difficulties, we remain optimistic about the future and will continue to invest in capacity expansion, decarbonisation, and digitalisation”.

New data will also include perspectives on the role of inflammation in a condition called atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). “For people living with diabetes and obesity, heart disease is one of the biggest threats that could change a person’s life in an instant. Semaglutide is proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 20-26% 1 , meaning fewer hospitalisations, heart attacks, stroke and deaths,” said Ludovic Helfgott, executive vice president and head of Product & Portfolio Strategy at Novo Nordisk. The key role of cardiovascular inflammation in ASCVD will be discussed in a Novo Nordisk symposium on Saturday, 30 August. ASCVD is a condition where blood vessels that carry blood to your heart cut off the blood flow to other parts of your body, making those vessels stiff and narrow. Additionally, a range of real-world evidence is being presented, providing a thorough analysis of the impact of inflammation in cardiovascular disease on mortality and major cardiovascular events in people with ASCVD. Real-world evidence is data from everyday healthcare settings that show how treatments work in real life, beyond controlled clinical trials. “At the ESC congress, we are presenting new data substantiating the unique range of benefits semaglutide has on people with heart and kidney disease, as demonstrated in both clinical trials and in the real world,” Ludovic Helfgott said. “Semaglutide is unrivalled in the GLP-1 class with its proven reduction in heart attack, stroke, kidney complications and cardiovascular death.” Key Novo Nordisk data at the ESC congress 2025 include: Scientific Sessions: Unravelling cardiovascular inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD): from evidence to guidance – Saturday 30 August; 10:00 – 10:45 CEST GLP-1RAs in obesity-related HFpEF: a new era in treatment – Sunday 31 August; 10:00 –10:45 CEST A change of heart – why cardiologists can’t ignore semaglutide – Sunday 31 August; 12:30 – 13:30 CEST Poster and oral presentations: Ozempic ® (once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg) Effect of semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and peripheral artery disease: an analysis of the STRIDE trial stratified by disease severity and age – Friday 29 August; 08:35 – 08:45 CEST STRIDE Outcomes by Sex – Sunday 31 August; 09:15 – 09:30 CEST Rybelsus ® (once-daily oral semaglutide) Effects of oral semaglutide on heart failure outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease participating in SOUL trial – Friday 29 August; 14:40 – 14:50 CEST Impact of oral semaglutide on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease: a SOUL post hoc analysis – Saturday 30 August; 08:33 – 08:51 CEST Effect of oral semaglutide on CV outcomes across the vascular disease spectrum, from no vascular disease to polyvascular disease, in high-risk type 2 diabetes – Monday 1 September; 13:15 – 14:00 CEST Wegovy ® (once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg) Semaglutide effects on incidence and reoccurrence of atrial fibrillation in the SELECT trial – Friday 29 August; 14:30 – 14:40 CEST Semaglutide is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with tirzepatide in patients with overweight or obesity and ASCVD and without diabetes in routine clinical practice – Sunday 31 August; 09:00 – 09:15 CEST Potential real-world benefit of semaglutide 2.4 mg on cardiovascular outcomes in the UK based on the SELECT trial – Sunday 31 August; 17:40 – 17:50 CEST Relationship between baseline LDL cholesterol levels and cardiovascular outcomes in adults with cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity: an exploratory analysis of the SELECT trial – Monday 1 September; 13:15 – 14:00 CEST Cardiovascular inflammation Associations between C-reactive protein levels and mortality in individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease: results from the UK Discover database – Friday 29 August; 08:51 – 09:09 CEST Residual inflammation, cholesterol risks and rates of major cardiovascular events in routinely cared patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease – Sunday 31 August; 08:45 – 08:55 CEST Direct healthcare costs for individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease stages 3–4 or both: results from the UK Discover database – Monday 1 September; 14:15 – 15:00 CEST Awareness and perceptions on the role of systemic inflammation in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease: a national study among cardiologists and nephrologists in China – Monday 1 September; 14:15 – 15:00 CEST General obesity Cardiovascular outcomes in a SELECT-like obesity population: real-world insights from the Swedish AROS study – Saturday 30 August; 10:15 – 11:00 CEST If you have any questions about the data or want more information, reach out to .

The first half of the year was a transition period mainly driven by structural changes in key markets such as Brazil. We have completed the restructuring of our business and are ready to capture the opportunities of a sports-rich second half of the year, with preparations for the FIFA World Cup 2026 already underway. I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to all colleagues for your dedication and efforts during this transition phase.” Highlights Q2, 2025: The financial guidance for the full year 2025 remains unchanged. Revenue decreased by 18% to 82 mEUR, with organic growth decreasing by 19%. The development was in line with expectations. The Q2 performance reflects the following factors: The Brazilian market revenue‑share income continued ahead of expectation and was 8 mEUR lower than last year. This was supported by stronger-than-anticipated player retention and wagering activity. The North American business performed in line with expectations. Revenue declined by 8 mEUR versus Q2 2024, of which the FX impact was 2 mEUR, impacted by lower marketing spend and the North Carolina state launch last year. Revenue share income increased by 7% in the quarter, supported by the continued ramp-up of revenue share income from North American partners. Tournament comparison effect : Last year’s second quarter benefited from the UEFA European Championship and Copa América boost, resulting in a year-on-year impact of estimated 5 mEUR Growth: During the quarter, we observed growth of 4 mEUR in our Paid Media business, alongside sustained momentum in Esports and M&A contributions from the acquisition of AceOdds. The sports win margin was above expectations in Q2, similar to Q2 2024. Recurring revenue declined by 15%, primarily driven by a 15% decrease in revenue share following the implementation of new regulation in Brazil. CPM revenue decreased by 25%, in line with broader market trends and no larger sports tournaments in play compared to last year. While several initiatives to improve advertising revenue have been launched under the AdVantage project to address this, the associated revenue uplift has yet to materialize. CPA revenue declined by 31%, reflecting lower partner activity in the US market. Sponsorship revenue was down 5% in line with expectations and significantly better than market trends. Conversely, subscription revenue increased by 8%, supported by community-based media in North America. Group costs decreased by 12 mEUR compared to the same period last year. This represents the first quarter with a similar year-over-year comparison, and the 12 mEUR in quarterly savings, when annualized, align with the 50 mEUR target set at the launch of our cost efficiency program in October 2024. Costs even further accelerated during Q3 2024, particularly in connection with the NFL launch, before beginning to decline following the program’s implementation. The majority of realized savings is attributable to the Publishing segment. In addition to the 12 mEUR in direct cost reductions, our restructuring process earlier in 2025 identified further efficiencies, which have been reinvested into the business to support future growth. With this, Better Collective confirms the achievement of its 50 mEUR cost savings ambition and will maintain its focus on disciplined capital allocation and operational efficiency. EBITDA before special items amounted to 23 mEUR, a 21% year‑on‑year decline in line with expectations, corresponding to an EBITDA margin before special items of 28%. The free cash flow amounted to 13 mEUR in Q2 2025 and 21 mEUR in YTD 2025, in line with expectations and the free cash flow guidance to reach 55-75 mEUR for the full year. Cash flow from operations before special items was 19 mEUR with a cash conversion of 83% in Q2 2025. The cash flow was negatively impacted by continued delayed payments from customers in Brazil due to the new regulations, including establishing new commercial and administrative frameworks. Better Collective has received the payments in Q3 2025. Better Collective has bank credit facilities of a total of 319 mEUR. By the end of June 2025, capital reserves stood at 87 mEUR, consisting of cash of 22 mEUR and unused bank credit facilities of 65 mEUR. Better Collective reports Esports as its own segment from Q2 2025, underscoring the uniqueness and strategic importance of the business. Anchored by flagship community platforms HLTV and FUTBIN, the segment reaches millions of highly engaged fans and generated 5 mEUR in Q2 2025 revenue, compared with 20 mEUR for the full year 2024. The split-out enhances transparency for both internal and external focus. On 3 April 2025, Better Collective announced an expansion of its digital sports audience to have increased by more than 10% from 400 to 450 million monthly visits globally. On 22 April 2025, Better Collective completed a buyback of 10 mEUR. Better Collective held 3.3% of the company’s outstanding share capital. On 22 April 2025, Better Collective held its Annual General Meeting, where all points were approved. Amongst other things, it was decided to cancel 1.8% of the company’s outstanding share capital to enhance shareholder value. Thomas Plenborg, current Chairman of DSV A/S, was elected as a new member of the Board, as Petra Rohr decided to step down. On 21 May 2025, Better Collective announced the initiation of a new buyback of up to 10 mEUR to be executed before 26th of August 2025, or until it is completed. New Depositing Customers (NDCs) developed in line with expectations excluding Brazil, however Brazil continued below expectations due to the regulatory framework. The NDCs reached 300k for the quarter of which 86% were revenue share. Volumes continue to be affected by regulatory restrictions in Brazil, specifically the prohibition of welcome bonuses. For comparison, Q2 last year delivered 501k NDCs, driven by approximately 100k sign-ups related to UEFA EURO 2024 and additional inflows from Copa América and the North Carolina state launch. Brazil has been a significant contributor to our NDC development in the past years, which is showcased in the report. Splitting out the Brazilian NDCs, the underlying NDC trend remains healthy and more stable. Despite the decline in NDC volumes, the underlying performance of the revenue share databases remains strong. This is reflected in the sustained strength of the Value of Deposits metric, also shown in the report. This KPI measures the total value deposited by referred users across our partner platforms and serves as a clear indicator of traffic quality and player value. The development highlights Better Collective’s ability to consistently drive higher-quality traffic, with referred players demonstrating increased lifetime value - even with lower NDC volumes. Hence, Better Collective focuses on and manages to send fewer, but higher-quality customers to our partners. The increase in Value of Deposits in recent years is partly attributable to the rapid expansion in Brazil, as well as the transition to revenue share in the US, where deposit values have grown but are yet to be recognized in reported revenue. Better Collective maintains its expectation of generating 10-15 mEUR in revenue share income from North America in 2025. The decline at the beginning of 2025 reflects the Brazilian regulatory framework going live, while the increase in Q2 2025 reflects activity in Brazil increasing again. Significant events after the close The Board of Directors intends to initiate a new 20 mEUR share buyback program following the completion of the current program.

While the CRO business also experienced revenue growth in the second quarter of 12% year-over-year, the full-year outlook for CRO revenue in 2025 has been revised to be slightly below CRO revenue level in 2024 (previous outlook 10-20% revenue growth). Outlook for EBIT-margin in the CRO business has been revised to around 20% (previously 25-31%). Our CRO business has grown very significantly over the last two years where revenue has by far outpaced our mid-term annual growth guidance of 10%. In 2025, we have experienced a decline in revenue from the US driven by macroeconomic uncertainty encompassing a difficult funding environment for some of our customers. This has translated into longer decision timelines. The development in Europe is on the contrary sound. As a result of the slowdown we experience in the US, we have adjusted our full-year 2025 outlook for CRO revenue to be slightly below the CRO revenue level in 2024 (previous outlook 10-20% revenue growth). EBIT-margin outlook for full-year 2025 for the CRO business has been adjusted to be around 20% (previously 25-31%).

Highlights Overall, the H1, 2025 came out stronger than expected and well ahead of H1, 2024. Topline, margins, bottom-line, and inventories have all improved against 2024, 1 st half. However, Glunz & Jensen Holding A/S is currently not able to estimate or to conclude how the imposing of trade tariffs will affect the demand for equipment, spares, and services in the remaining part of 2025, and/or how the profitability of Glunz & Jensen will be affected accordingly. The revenue for H1 2025 amounted to DKK 74,5 million (H1 2024: DKK 64,9 million). The gross profit amounted to DKK 19,6 million in H1 2025 (H1 2024: DKK 15,0 million), the gross profit margin was 26,3% (H1 2024: 23,1%). The improved margins are due to the implementation of Plan-2026 as described in the annual report for 2024. Plan-2026 includes operational consolidation, additional focus on purchase of parts and materials, additional focus on new markets, an updated go-to-market approach, new product launches, and organizational adjustments. Plan-2026 is on track. EBITDA for the period was DKK 9,5 million (H1 2024: DKK 4,1 million). Profit before tax for the period H1 2025 was DKK 6,3 million (H1 2024: DKK 1,0 million), corresponding to a result per share (EPS) at DKK 2,7 (H1 2024: DKK 0,4). Glunz & Jensen continuously monitors its financial performance and will communicate an updated 2025 outlook (guidance) in the event of any material deviations from the already communicated outlook dated November 20 th , 2024. Following the mandate received at the annual general meeting on April 9 th , 2025, Glunz & Jensen Holding A/S has initiated; “a formal review process, including market assessments, identifying potential buyers, and determining the best approach for a sale and initiate the actual selling of Selandia Park A/S, or the selling of assets (primarily the investment property) owned by Selandia Park A/S, and finalize the sale”.

The financial performance of most of the network was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Our key earnings challenge in 2025 remains therefore to resolve three specific focus areas: Adapting Mediterranean ferry operations to competitive environment change Turning Logistics Türkiye & Europe South around to breakeven by year-end 2025 Delivering on Logistics Boost turnaround projects initiated in 2024. The realised and expected delivery on the Logistics Boost projects is in line with the expectations for 2025 set earlier this year. The adaptation of the Mediterranean business unit progressed in Q2 2025 but less than expected. Volumes were to a large extent intact but the impact from pricing initiatives fell short of expectations. Further actions have been launched to improve the effectiveness of the yield recovery in the remainder of the year. The Türkiye & Europe South turnaround progressed well in Q2 2025 with regard to rightsizing of the network while volumes and margins were below target, partly due to Turkish transport market dynamics. Achieving the breakeven target in 2025 may therefore be delayed. Outlook updated To reflect the challenges facing two of the focus areas, the EBIT outlook for 2025 is updated to a range of DKK 0.8-1.0bn from previously an EBIT of around DKK 1.0bn. The Q2 cash flow generation was on track and financial leverage is set to improve as expected in H2. The 2025 outlook for Adjusted free cash flow is unchanged DKK 1.0bn. The outlook is detailed on page 4. Geopolitics drive European nearshoring Towards the end of July 2025, the EU and USA entered into a trade agreement that set a general tariff of 15% on EU exports to USA. The agreement may curb demand for parts of the EU’s export sector which in turn could impact Europe’s economic short-term growth prospects. The agreement seems likely to support Europe’s determination to become more self-reliant and we expect nearshoring to grow trading with manufacturing hubs such as Türkiye and Morocco which will benefit our network.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

As previously communicated, the business is now divided into the three business areas: Contracting, Transport, and Technology. In addition, two new Business Area Managers have been appointed as an important step forward in this journey. Railcare’s operations are now built on these three business areas. Each with its specific offering, but also with strong synergies. In order to achieve growth and reach the company’s 2027 financial targets, the business areas must expand both individually and together. “Our customers increasingly demand comprehensive solutions, and within the Group we offer a wide range of expertise. From railway maintenance and transportation to machine and locomotive workshops. This breadth is unique in our industry and gives us a deeper understanding of our customers’ challenges – whether it is the importance of locomotive revisions, track time, or reliable transportation,” says Mattias Remahl, CEO of Railcare Group, and continues: “By strengthening collaboration both within and between our business areas, we are creating the right conditions for our growth journey.” As part of this development, changes have also been made in the management team. With increased demand for machine sales and workshop services, Patrik Söderholm, previously Head of the Locomotive Workshop, has been appointed as the new Business Area Manager for Technology. Jonny Granlund, who previously managed both Contracting and Technology, will remain Business Area Manager for Contracting. Torbjörn Larsson, formerly Head of Transport, has been appointed Business Area Manager for Transport. All three are part of the Group Management. “With an organisational structure that places our operations at the core and is designed to scale, we are now strong and well-positioned to continue developing our business in line with our long-term goals,” concludes Mattias Remahl.

Kostnadsbesparingar och en omorganisation genomförs omdelbart där personalstyrkan minskas med 50%, det cypriotiska dotterbolaget avvecklas samt att AI blir en integrerad del i verksamhetens samtliga steg. Samtliga kostnadsbesparingar beräknas ge full effekt innan årets utgång. Avvecklingen av det cypriotiska dotterbolaget innebär ingen initial resultat- eller kassaflödeseffekt för koncernen under det andra kvartalet. Däremot har moderbolagets andelar i dotterbolaget skrivits ned vilket påverkar moderbolagets resultat i perioden om 591 TSEK. Väsentliga händelser efter periodens utgång CFO lämnar sin befattning Bolaget meddelade den 8 juli 2025 att CFO Martin Larsson har beslutat att lämna sin position för att ta sig an nya utmaningar utanför bolaget. Martin kommer att kvarstå i sin roll tills en efterträdare har utsetts för att säkra en god överlämning. En rekryteringsprocess har inletts. Storägare ökar sitt innehav till över 20% Bolaget meddelade den 16 juli 2025 att bolagets storägare Özkan Egos innehav nu överstiger 20% av totalt antal aktier och röster i bolaget efter ett antal genomförda insynsköp under juni och juli. Özkan är även styrelseordförande och medgrundare till Qiiwi Games. VD har ordet: "" AI-muskler hjälper oss fortsätta tänka och bygga stort! "" Under det andra kvartalet informerade vi om ytterligare optimeringar och kostnadsbesparingar i vår verksamhet. Detta då vi de senaste åren odlat ett AI-fokuserat tankesätt, något vi nu ser eskalerar mer och mer. Den effekt vi bedömmer kunna få genom AI framöver ledde till beslutet att minska personalstyrkan med totalt 50% samt helt avveckla vårt dotterbolag på Cypern. Bedömningen är att dessa förändringar kommer ge en total minskad kostnadsbas per månad om ca 450 TSEK, troligtvis mer då ytterligare besparingar har identifierats under Q2 och Q3. Detta förstärker bolagets möjlighet att som ett första steg driva verksamheten mot ett break-even resultat på månadsbasis. ""Minskad omsättning men stabiliserad under Q2"" Under den rapporterade perioden når vi en omsättning på ca 3,3 MSEK jämfört med ca 5,4 MSEK under samma period föregående år. Minskningen härleds till minskade intäkter från speltitlar som presterade på högre nivå Q2 2024. Detta är bland annat Extreme Makeover: Home Edition samt Midsomer Murders, speltitlar som bolaget i dagsläget fokuserar mindre på. Under det andra kvartalet och även in i det tredje har vi sett en positiv utveckling av intäkter månad - månad, vilket innebär en stabilisering och mindre ökning av Live Operations-portföljen. Vi genererar dock lägre intäkter jämfört med första kvartalet 2025, vilket beror på att merparten av det kvartalets intäkter generades under januari i samband med vår globala lansering av Backpacker® Go!. Det är positivt att vi lyckats stabilisera och vända trenden av minskade intäkter under det andra kvartalet. Detta är drivet av förbättringar i avkastning på marknadsföring för Backpacker® Go! men även Wordington. De tre största bidragsgivarna kopplat till periodens omsättning har varit: 1. Backpacker® Go! (44%) 2. Wordington (24%) 3. Extreme Makeover (9%) Vi når ett något förbättrat EBITDA-resultat jämfört med samma period föregående år. Vid full effekt av våra kostnadsbesparingar mot senare delen av året förväntar vi oss att se ett förbättrat EBITDA-resultat kommande kvartal. ""Marknadsföring/UA"" En grundläggande del i den förbättrade avkastningen på investeringar i marknadsföring är användandet av AI i generering av annonsmaterial, något som gör att vi betydligt snabbare kan utvärdera nya annonskoncept. Med detta arbetssätt skall vi fortsätta utvärdera även andra speltitlar i portföljen för att se om vi kan nå nya insikter om tillväxtpotential för dessa. Under den rapporterade perioden har vi totalt investerat ca 1,2 MSEK jämfört med ca 2,7 MSEK samma period föregående år, en minskning med ca 55%. Jämför vi mot Q1 2025, under Backpacker® Go! globala lansering, minskade investeringarna i marknadsföring med ca 48%. Investeringar i marknadsföring är fluktuerande och beror på om vi har nya spel att lansera som befinner sig i en uppskalningsfas eller ej. Under den rapporterade perioden har vi inte haft några spel i den fasen utan fokuserat på att investera i marknadsföring där vi är trygga att nå vårt mål med 100% avkastning inom 180 dagar. ""New Games"" Inom New Games har vi under perioden utvärderat flera nya spelidéer och prototyper, framför allt har vi lagt fokus på att utvärdera Zen-tema i kombination med ordpussel. En avslappnande spelupplevelse som är populär där vi vill skapa oss egna insikter kring potential. I dagsläget är detta test i sin slutfas. Vi har även fokuserat på att förenkla processen kring att testa nya spelidéer ytterligare genom att påbörja arbetet med att ta fram något vi kallar för “The Qiiwi Template”. Detta innebär att vi framöver kommer kunna testa nya spelidéer med ett betydligt bredare bibliotek av viktiga spelfunktioner redan från start, funktioner som är viktiga för att kunna avgöra ett spels långsiktiga kvarhållningsgrad/retention. Vi har flera väldigt spännande spelidéer som skall realiseras och testas framöver där kombinationen av användandet av AI är högst på prioriteringslistan. ""Live Operations"" Under perioden har speltiteln Backpacker® Go! övergått i Live Operations-status vilket innebär att vi mer fokuserar på att stabilisera speltitelns lönsamhet än tillväxt. Under perioden har vi förbättrat funktionerna i spelet relaterat till lagspel och event. Spelet täcker just nu 112 städer och 18 så kallade “Stjärndestinationer” där spelare ges möjlighet att besöka specifika platser både på jorden men även i rymden med sitt lag. Under perioden lanserade vi även en uppdatering till speltiteln MasterChef där vi med mindre arbetsinsatser ställt om spelet till ett mer rent match-3-spel likt Extreme Makeover: Home Edition. MasterChef är ett starkt varumärke som driver organiska nedladdningar från spelbutikerna. Målsättningen med denna uppdatering är att se om denna ändring vi genomfört kan leda till någon form av förbättring relaterat till kvarhållning/retention av spelare, vilket i så fall kan ge ökande intäkter inom Live Operations-portföljen. ""Qiiwi Games - Ett litet team stärkt av AI"" På Qiiwi Games strävar vi dagligen efter att maximera den effekten vi kan få genom att nyttja AI-tjänster inom vår arbetsprocess fullt ut. Detta innebär även hur vi kan bygga spel som i sin spelmekanik nyttjar AI för att till exempel skapa unika spelupplevelser och automatiskt utöka tillgängligt innehåll i våra spel. Här är till exempel AI-agenter som sköter stora delar av ett spels livscykel något vi tror mycket på. Denna utveckling är extremt spännande och lyckas vi väl här och kan ta snabbare steg än våra konkurrenter ser framtiden ljus ut. Föreställ er en organisation som skalar upp med fler AI-agenter, istället för fler anställda - till en bråkdel av kostnaden. Vi bedömer att vi i dagsläget är på rätt väg mot att nå positivt kassaflöde när samtliga kostnadsbesparingar gett full effekt vilket sker mot slutet av året. Med de nu genomförda ytterligare optimeringarna i vår verksamhet och en stabil kassa kommer vi framöver arbeta hårdare än någonsin för att ta oss till nya betydligt högre nivåer!

The better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by the initial positive effects of the change in business model for the Swedish distribution business SDR, focusing on automated packing of printed matter, and the takeover of local sales from former franchisees. The EBITDA loss in Bekey was also reduced. These positive effects formed the basis of the upgrade of our full-year EBITDA and EBIT guidance announced last week.” Financial highlights: DKKm Q2 Q2 YTD 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue 342.3 343.1 652.8 662.0 EBITDA 48.4 60.6 59.0 101.5 EBIT 32.4 44.1 31.0 56.2 EBIT margin (%) 9.5 12.9 4.7 8.5 Return on securities 92.7 141.2 -59.0 296.9 Cash flows from operating activities 48.8 39.6 25.8 36.5 Free cash flows 32.4 6.3 -3.0 3.0 Performance in the business areas in Q2 2025 Last Mile (FK Distribution and SDR) Revenue was DKK 300m against DKK 302m in the year-earlier period. The continued positive effect of taking over local sales from former franchise partners in SDR largely outweighed the expected drop in volumes in FK Distribution. In line with expectations, EBITDA fell by 25% to DKK 46m. The decline was primarily due to the roll-out of automated packing for Sweden, the transition of SDR and increased capacity costs in FK Distribution, including the effect of pay adjustments for deliverers in Denmark in 2024. EBIT fell to DKK 34m for an EBIT margin of 11%. Digital Services (BoligPortal, Dayli and Bekey) Revenue was up 2% to DKK 42m, driven by a 7% growth rate in BoligPortal attributable to partnerships and tenants. EBITDA was DKK 2m, against a breakeven result in Q2 2024, attributable to improvements in BoligPortal and a loss reduction in Bekey. Operating profit (EBIT) broke even, against a loss of DKK 2m for the same period last year, resulting in a profit margin of 1%. YTD performance Consolidated revenue in H1 2025 was down 2% to DKK 653m, impacted by Last Mile where the revenue increase in SDR did not offset the effect of a volume decline in FK Distribution. Digital Services delivered 3% growth. EBITDA fell by 42% to DKK 59m, primarily due to increased costs in Last Mile relating to automated packing for SDR and the business transition, while Digital Services delivered improvements. EBIT was down 45% to DKK 31m, driven by the revenue and EBITDA performance. The EBIT margin was 4.7%. Guidance for 2025 As announced in Company Announcement no. 10 of 14 August 2025, the Group’s full-year EBIT and EBITDA guidance for 2025 has been upgraded. North Media now expects consolidated revenue in the DKK 1,270-1,315m range, EBITDA in the DKK 105-130m range and EBIT in the DKK 50-75m range.

Rental income is now estimated at ISK 15,200–15,500 million and EBITDA at ISK 10,800–11,100 million for the year 2025. We are experiencing strong demand for commercial real estate. Rental income increased by 4.9% compared to the same period last year. Changes to the property portfolio have had a positive impact on year-on-year rental growth, while like-for-like rental growth amounts to 0.3%. Two major transactions were completed in the second quarter of 2025, adding two outstanding properties, Gróska and the Exeter Hotel, to the Company’s portfolio. These properties are highly consistent with the Company’s strategy as they are both located within designated core areas, with tenants including both listed companies and public entities. The additional annual rental income from these assets is estimated at ISK 1,600 million as of 2026. The occupancy rate is 97%, in line with previous levels. Approximately 43% of the Company’s rental income derives from public entities and listed companies. Tenant defaults remain low and numerous leasing projects are in the pipeline.” Operations and Performance Operating revenues amounted to ISK 7,578 million in the first six months of the year, of which rental income amounted to ISK 7,169 million. Rental income increased by 4.9% compared to the same period in 2024, corresponding to a real increase of just under 0.5%. Several changes to the property portfolio between years have had an impact on rental income. EBITDA amounted to ISK 5,088 million, representing an increase of 4.5% compared to the same period in 2024. At the publication of the 2024 annual results, the Company presented its operating plan for 2025. Earnings guidance for 2025 has now been revised following transactions completed during the year. Rental income is now estimated at ISK 15,200–15,500 million and EBITDA at ISK 10,800–11,100 million. As a result of the investments made during the year, The Company’s Management expects rental income from the current property portfolio for the next twelve months to be in the range of ISK 16.4–16.7 billion Assets and Financial Position The fair value of the Company’s investment properties, excluding lease assets, is estimated at ISK 212,955 million. The portfolio now consists of 97 properties with a total area of approximately 389 thousand square metres. The occupancy rate is around 97%, based on revenues that would be generated under full occupancy. The total fair value adjustment for the first six months of the year amounted to ISK 1,414 million. Activity and Outlook In June, the Company completed two major transactions. Firstly, it acquired all the share capital in Gróska ehf. and Gróðurhúsið ehf. Gróska ehf. owns the property Gróska, comprising approximately 18,600 sqm together with a 6,200 sqm underground car park, or a total of around 24,800 sqm. Secondly, the Company acquired Tryggvagata ehf., which owns the properties at Tryggvagata 14 and 10. The total floor area of these properties is approximately 5,500 sqm, consisting of a 106-room, four-star hotel in downtown Reykjavík (Exeter Hotel) and an adjoining office building. The additional annual rental income from these two transactions is estimated at ISK 1,600 million as of 2026. In total, 36 lease agreements covering approximately 17,290 sqm were concluded in the second quarter, equal to the same period last year, which was the largest quarter in the Company’s history. Among the largest lease agreements during the period were: an agreement with Öldungur for 10,384 sqm in the property at Sóltún 2; an agreement with Samherji for 1,255 sqm for its new headquarters at Hagasmári 1; an agreement with EFLA for 1,009 sqm in the property at Glerárgata 32; and an agreement with Arctica Finance for 825 sqm at Katrínartún 2. All restaurant units in the new food hall, set to open in Smáralind in the coming months, have been leased — thirteen in total. There was strong demand for participation in the project. Recently, Starbucks opened a new café at Hafnartorg Gallery, Bryggjugata 2. This is Starbucks’ second location in Iceland and also its largest. The opening of Starbucks is in line with Heimar’s strategy to create vibrant core areas where people can live, work, and enjoy leisure Sustainability The number of the Company’s environmentally certified properties increased during the period, with six properties now certified, representing approximately 41% of the Company’s portfolio. Gróska was recently added to the portfolio of certified assets, and Dvergshöfði 2 is expected to follow in the autumn.

Operating profit is projected to be in the range of ISK 4,270–4,430 million. The forecast assumes that the announced transactions relating to income-generating properties will be completed in the third quarter of 2025. CEO’s Statement – Jón Þór Gunnarsson “ Solid operations and continued growth characterize the first half of the year. We are now seeing the benefits of prior years’ investments, resulting in 24% revenue growth and a stronger position for the Company. At the same time, we maintained a 78% operating profit margin (NOI ratio), which remains very strong. During the period, Kaldalón invested ISK 3.5 billion, with most of the investments made late in the half-year. Revenues from these will therefore be recognized in the second half of the year. These investments include Suðurhraun 4–6 in Garðabær and Grjótháls 2 in Reykjavík. A new service station was also delivered at Lambhagavegur. Kaldalón has, in a short time, developed a dense network of car-wash facilities for a client, with strong demand underscoring the quality and potential of arterial-road sites owned by the Company. Building permits have also been approved for 3,400 m² of industrial premises at Fossaleyni 19–23 in Reykjavík, to house food production. Delivery is scheduled for the second half of next year. The Company has signed purchase agreements, subject to customary conditions, for Krókháls 16, Skúlagata 15, and Klettháls 1A in Reykjavík. These acquisitions are expected to increase annual revenues by ISK 203 million once completed. Total assets at mid-year amounted to just under ISK 81 billion. Interest-bearing debt was just over ISK 45 billion, with the loan-to-value ratio broadly unchanged at 57.6%. During the period, the Company issued bonds and commercial papers in the market totaling ISK 6.7 billion. Listed debt now represents 31% of interest-bearing liabilities, in line with the strategy of increasing indexed debt and market-based financing. The Company’s market funding terms indicate considerable opportunities for refinancing. Demand for rental space remains stable, and the economy shows resilience to a high interest rate environment. There are no indications of a change in this trend, although the long-term effects remain to be seen. Risk-free rates increased during the period, with a negative impact on property valuations. Kaldalón continues to benefit from strong cash flows, with a weighted average lease maturity of nearly 10 years. The Company is well positioned to serve its clients’ needs and capitalize on the many opportunities we see in the real estate market. ” Purchase Agreements for New Properties Purchase agreements, subject to conditions, have been signed for Krókháls 16, Skúlagata 15, and Klettháls 1A. The total purchase price is ISK 2,335 million, payable in cash and/or by assumption of debt. The acquisitions are expected to increase Kaldalón’s annual operating profit by ISK 171 million. Completion is anticipated in Q3 2025. Interim Financial Statements 2025 The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The report of the Board of Directors and CEO is included therein. Investor Presentation In connection with the publication of the results, an investor meeting will be held on Friday, 22 August, at 08:30 at Grand Hotel, Sigtún 28, Reykjavík. Doors open at 08:15.

OUTLOOK FOR 2025 (unchanged) In 2025, Fondia will focus on improving profitability. The market situation remains uncertain, and this will have a weakening impact on the ability to assess the demand for legal services and the factors affecting it. CEO TIMO LAPPI: “During the first half of the year, we succeeded in stabilizing our operations and laying the foundations for the future. The early part of the year was challenging for us in terms of results, as we had expected following the change negotiations in our Finnish operations. However, the growth in international business during the first part of the year and the direction of our operating indicators in Finland give us confidence for the future. Our growth challenges within the Group continued during the reporting period and efforts to improve profitability continue. The EBITDA and operating profit margins adjusted for non-recurring items for the reporting periods were weakened by the decline in total net sales, which was only partially offset by the Group's savings programme. During the April–June reporting period, two important things happened for us. First, we completed our strategy work. We have always had a strong will and ability to renew the legal services market by making our services more agile, business-oriented, and technology-enabled. Our vision, ""Rewriting the Legal Industry"", remains relevant, and our mission, ""Human Excellence"", emphasizes the importance of experts in supporting customers’ businesses and as well as providing high-quality, human centric legal work. People's input is crucial, even though we are living in a time of profound technological transformation. We updated our medium-term financial targets and key initiatives for the coming years to implement our strategy and achieve profitable growth. In the coming years, we will implement our strategy and pursue profitable growth through four key initiatives: enhancing customer work efficiency, strengthening employee experience, renewing our Legal Department as a Service (LDaas) offering, and leveraging new legal technology. Another, more personal thing was that I became Fondia's CEO for the second time. I was able to return to the company and the team that are important to me. We will continue to reform our operations and our focus for the current financial year will be on profitability by turning net sales back to growth by putting customers at the heart of everything we do, improving employee satisfaction and advancing our strategic projects. We closely monitor the market and react swiftly, without compromising the customer or employee experience.” April–June 2025 The Group’s net sales decreased by 7.5% in April–June compared to the comparison period. Net sales in Finland decreased by 10.8% during the reporting period compared to the comparison period, mainly due to the continued impact of the change negotiations in the early part of the year. Our international net sales increased by 1.4% in April–June. In Sweden, our net sales declined by 1.5%, while growth in the Baltics continued and was 17.4% compared to the comparison period. The Group's adjusted EBITDA margin (EBITDA-%) for April–June was 8.0% (9.5) and the adjusted operating margin (EBIT-%) was 4.1% (6.1). January–June 2025 During the reporting period January–June, our company's net sales decreased by 8.1% compared to the comparison period. Net sales for the first half of the year decreased by 12.2% in Finland, increased by 1.0% in Sweden and by 11.7% in the Baltics compared to the comparison period. Our international net sales grew by a total of 2.6% in the first half of the year. During the reporting period January–June, all ongoing services represented 45% (44) of the Group's net sales. The share of total invoicing for Legal Department Service (LDaaS) customers and other customers covered by ongoing services was 67% (76) of net sales. In Sweden, the share of all ongoing services was 37% (45) of net sales and in the Baltics 39% (29). All ongoing services represented 47% (43) of net sales in Finland. International net sales represented 26% (23) of the Group's total net sales. In January–June, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.3% (9.7) and the adjusted EBIT margin was 3.7% (6.6).

THIS PRESS RELEASE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER TO BUY SECURITIES IN ONCOPEPTIDES AB (PUBL). SEE ALSO THE SECTION “IMPORTANT INFORMATION” BELOW IN THIS DOCUMENT. Oncopeptides AB (publ) (“Oncopeptides” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq Stockholm: ONCO) hereby announces that the Board of Directors has resolved to carry out a partially guaranteed new share issue of approximately SEK 150 million with preferential rights for the Company’s existing shareholders (the “Rights Issue”) based on the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting on 22 May 2025. The purpose of the Rights Issue is to finance the ongoing commercialization of Pepaxti® in Europe until the Company expects to become cash flow positive by the end of 2026, and also to secure early progression of the Company’s portfolio of pre-clinical assets. HealthCap VIII LP has committed to subscribe for SEK 15.5 million and certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company and senior executives intend to enter into binding subscription undertakings after the publication of the Company’s interim report for the second quarter of 2025. In addition, several guarantors have provided guarantee commitments which, in total, amount to SEK 113.8 million. Under the guarantee commitments, the guarantors shall subscribe for any shares not otherwise subscribed for up to SEK 130 million (the “Committed Amount”). In total, the Company has received a subscription undertaking, subscription intentions and guarantee commitments covering approximately 87 percent of the Rights Issue, corresponding to approximately SEK 130 million. As first communicated during the first quarter 2025, the Company is making progress in its partnership negotiations for Japan. The Company continues its negotiations with well-established sizeable Japanese pharma companies for the licensing of Pepaxti for the Japanese market and are in advanced discussions with, and have received a non-binding offer from, one highly reputable partner and has in addition thereto also received a non-binding offer from another potential partner which the Company is considering in parallel. “This far in 2025, Oncopeptides has taken substantial steps on its journey to cash flow positive by the end of 2026. With our earlier than expected entry into the Italian market and even higher-than-expected second quarter sales growth, we see a good momentum for our European commercialization,” says Sofia Heigis, CEO of Oncopeptides. “As we continue our discussions to access the Japanese market for Pepaxti with what would be a landmark deal for Oncopeptides, this cash infusion ensures our ability to remain fully dedicated to our commercialization efforts and sales growth. It also enables us to secure progress with our pipeline assets, in which we see major global opportunities in multiple indications with high unmet medical needs.” Summary of the Rights Issue The Rights Issue is carried out to provide additional runway for the ongoing commercialization of Pepaxti in Europe and secure early progression of the Company’s portfolio of pre-clinical assets. The proceeds from the Rights Issue are deemed by the Board of Directors to be sufficient to reach profitability and cash flow positivity, regardless of if the Company only receives the Committed Amount and regardless of if the Company is successful in the negotiations regarding partnerships in Japan. The Rights Issue is covered to approximately 87 percent by a subscription undertaking, subscription intentions and guarantee commitments. The record date for the Rights Issue is 28 August 2025 and the subscription period will run from 1 September 2025 until 15 September 2025. The subscription price of SEK 3.20 per share corresponds to a discount of approximately 32 percent compared to the theoretical price (so called TERP – theoretical ex-rights price) based on the closing price of Oncopeptides’ share on Nasdaq Stockholm on 20 August 2025. Update on partnership negotiations in Japan As first communicated during the first quarter 2025, the Company is involved in partnership negotiations in Japan, have made further progress over the last months and is continuing its negotiations with well-established and sizeable Japanese pharma companies for the licensing of Pepaxti for the Japanese market. The Company is currently in advanced discussions with one highly reputable partner, with the due diligence process at a late stage, based on a non-binding offer which is in line with market practice and which includes several significant upfront and milestone payments and a double-digit royalty, with the partner assuming all costs related to regulatory activities and commercialization in Japan. The Company has in addition thereto also received a non-binding offer from another potential partner which the Company is considering in parallel. The partnership negotiations are non-binding at this time and there are no assurances that a binding agreement will be entered into or the timing thereof. Background and reasons Oncopeptides is a Swedish biotech company focused on the research, development and commercialization of targeted therapies for difficult-to-treat cancers. The company was founded 25 years ago and is today active in several important European markets, including Germany, Austria, Spain and Italy. Assuming that the Rights Issue is fully subscribed, the Company will receive approximately SEK 150 million before deduction of transactions costs. The Company intends to use the net proceeds to provide additional runway for the ongoing commercialization of Pepaxti in Europe and to secure early progression of the Company's portfolio of preclinical projects. The proceeds from the Rights Issue will strengthen the Company's financial position and are expected to be sufficient to finance the Company until it becomes cash flow positive which is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2026, regardless of if the Company only receives the Committed Amount and regardless of if the Company is successful in the negotiations regarding partnerships in Japan. Oncopeptides has recently reported on several important events regarding Pepaxti’s European commercialization and position in the market. The Rights Issue will provide the opportunity to boost the activities in Europe in order to fully exploit the positive news momentum. The Company assesses that receiving an upfront Japan license payment is likely but not certain until a deal has been finalized, as with all partnership negotiations. If the Company receives such Japan license payment, the Company will direct the additional funding to advance the Company’s pipeline and more specifically OPD5 to become at least IND ready as the asset has the potential for multiple indications with high unmet needs including glioblastoma and multiple myeloma. For multiple myeloma, the development path to a global market as a second-generation Peptide Drug Conjugate (PDC) is, relative to other projects, de-risked based on the learnings from melflufen. Terms of the Rights Issue Those who are registered as shareholders of ordinary shares in Oncopeptides on the record date 28 August 2025, will receive one (1) subscription right for each existing ordinary share. The subscription right provides the holder with the preferential right to subscribe for new ordinary shares, where nine (9) subscription rights entitle the holder to subscribe for two (2) new ordinary shares. In addition, it will be possible for investors to apply for subscription of shares without subscription rights. Should all shares not be subscribed for by virtue of subscription rights, the Board of Directors shall, within the framework of the maximum amount of the Rights Issue, decide on the allocation of ordinary shares which have not been subscribed for by virtue of subscription rights. In such case, ordinary shares shall: firstly, be allocated to those who have expressed an interest in subscribing and have subscribed for new ordinary shares by virtue of subscription rights, regardless if the subscriber were a shareholder on the record date or not, and in the event of oversubscription, in relation to the number of subscription rights each have exercised for subscription of new ordinary shares, secondly, be allocated to others whom have declared interest in subscribing for ordinary shares without exercising subscription rights, and in the event of oversubscription, in relation to the number of new ordinary shares specified in the respective subscription registration, and, to the extent that this is not possible, by lottery, thirdly and lastly, be allocated, up to the Committed Amount, to the investors who provided guarantees and in accordance with the conditions of their respective guarantee and, to the extent this cannot be done, by lottery. The subscription price is SEK 3.20 per new ordinary share. Assuming that the Rights Issue is fully subscribed, the share capital will be increased by approximately SEK 5,216,392.88, from approximately SEK 25,084,314.69 to approximately SEK 30,300,707.56, by new issue of 46,947,534 new ordinary shares, resulting in the total number of shares increasing from 225,758,823 shares to 272,706,357 shares. Shareholders who choose not to participate in the Rights Issue will, assuming that the Rights Issue is fully subscribed, have their shareholdings diluted by approximately 18.2 percent (based on the number of ordinary shares after completion of the Rights Issue). However, such shareholders have the opportunity to partially financially compensate for this dilution by selling their subscription rights. The subscription period is expected to run from and including 1 September 2025 until and including 15 September 2025 and trading in subscription rights is expected to run from and including 1 September 2025 and until and including 10 September 2025. Furthermore, trading in paid subscribed shares (BTA) is expected to run from and including 1 September 2025 until and including 22 September 2025. Subscription undertaking, subscription intentions and guarantee commitments HealthCap VIII LP has committed to subscribe for SEK 15.5 million. Certain members of the Board of Directors of the Company and senior executives also intend to enter into binding subscription undertakings after the publication of the Company’s interim report for the second quarter of 2025 up to their respective pro-rata amounts and this commitment and these intentions correspond to approximately 11 percent of the Rights Issue. Several guarantors have agreed to guarantee approximately 76 percent of the Rights Issue, corresponding to approximately SEK 113.8 million, at a guarantee compensation of 8 percent of the guaranteed amount in cash. Under the guarantee commitments, the guarantors shall subscribe for any shares not otherwise subscribed for up to the Committed Amount. The Rights Issue is thus approximately 87 percent covered through the subscription undertaking and intentions, and guarantee commitments. None of the above mentioned commitments are secured by bank guarantee, blocked funds, pledges or similar arrangements. Lock-up undertakings In connection with the Rights Issue, the Company has agreed to a lock-up undertaking, subject to customary exceptions, whereby the Company’s Board of Directors may not propose or resolve on any new share issuances for a period of 180 calendar days after the announcement of the outcome of the Rights Issue, provided, however, that the Company shall have the right to issue and transfer warrants to the European Investment Bank - EIB (in accordance with the agreement prior entered into between the Company and EIB). In addition, the members of the Board of Directors and senior management of Oncopeptides have agreed not to sell any shares in Oncopeptides for a period of 180 calendar days after the announcement of the outcome of the Rights Issue, subject to customary exceptions. Disclosure document Full terms of the Rights Issue and certain information about the Company will be presented in a disclosure document in accordance with Article 1.4 db of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the “ Prospectus Regulation ”).

The report in brief: Q2 2025 (vs Q2 2024): Net revenue decreased to KSEK 18,103 (20,385) which corresponds to a growth of -11 (-3)%. At constant exchange rates, the growth was -5 (-4)%. Compared to the first quarter of 2025, the growth was -4 (-4)%. Gross profit for the period amounted to KSEK 12,681 (15,312) with a margin of 70 (75)%. EBITDA for the period amounted to KSEK 3,113 (2,661) with a margin of 17 (13)%. Cash flow from operating activities amounted to KSEK 1,568 (2,217). Net Revenue Retention LTM amounted to 82 (103)%. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to KSEK 19,998 (35,304). CEO Letter from Quarterly Report When we close the first half of 2025 with our Q2 report we can confirm that the year has continued at roughly the same revenue levels as in Q1, while our EBITDA margin has improved. Revenue for the second quarter amounted to MSEK 18.1, with an EBITDA margin of 17%. This corresponds to a YoY revenue decline of 11%. However, it's worth noting that when adjusting for the lost revenues from our former customer RingCentral, which also carried fixed personnel costs at corresponding levels, revenue grew by 6%. Q2 2024 was the final quarter with revenue contributions from RingCentral, meaning that starting next quarter, YoY comparisons will offer a more accurate picture. Compared to Q1 2025, we saw a slight decrease in revenue. As previously communicated, Q1 saw a strong start in the newly regulated Brazilian iGaming market, driven by a surge of new user activity. It's common for newly opened markets to perform strongly initially, followed by a temporary decline in momentum, something we experienced during Q2, with reduced traffic volumes. Additionally, increased tax pressure on both operators and suppliers has led to lower operator investments, which indirectly impacts our opportunities in the region. As part of our efforts to achieve positive cash flow, we continue to streamline our organization to improve cost control, while simultaneously working to grow revenue in a sustainable manner. The intensified cost focus initiated in Q2 is now beginning to show in the numbers. This impact will strengthen further during Q3 and reach full effect in Q4. In my previous CEO Letter, I mentioned new revenue streams and the strong initial traction for our latest biometric login product, FaceCheckin. We continue to see strong interest, particularly within the travel and aviation industries. Our expectations remain high for securing additional revenue in the travel segment, both from existing and new customers. While procurement and contract negotiation cycles remain long, it is encouraging to observe how the industry is moving faster from a technical perspective, especially in the adoption of facial recognition and biometric technologies. This is, of course, highly favorable for Checkin.com. Our position in the industry is growing stronger through ongoing collaborations with major players like Ryanair and WestJet, and we are currently involved in multiple procurement processes with both airlines and other relevant actors in the space. On the topic of new revenue streams, we went live during the quarter with an omnichannel launch in partnership with the Philippine-based Solaire Resort. We are seeing growing interest in our omnichannel offering, where we bridge the customer’s digital and physical operations. Another large customer is expected to go live this fall. With a market-leading platform and increasing global interest in our company, we remain focused on regaining our position as a profitable growth company. We look forward to an exciting second half of 2025.

CEO KARI TUOMALA: IMPROVING PROFITABILITY SUPPORTS STRONG GROWTH In the first half of 2025, our revenue grew strongly to EUR 24.9 (6.7) million. This growth was driven in particular by successful deliveries of modular energy storage solutions in Finland and the delivery of power quality solutions and products to international customers. The development was driven by active demand in both the energy storage business supporting renewable energy and the power quality market, which promotes energy efficiency. During the review period, we succeeded in improving the profitability of the company's operations. We improved the productization of our deliveries, which resulted in greater efficiency in the operations of our own factory. In addition, we were able to leverage the experience and expertise gained from previous deliveries. Our operating margin (EBITDA) for the first half of the year was approximately EUR 0.3 million positive, whereas in the comparison period it was approximately EUR 3.4 million negative. Net sales for the comparison period were exceptionally low, which means that the periods are not entirely comparable. A significant part of the 2024 net sales and margin were recognized in the second half of the year, so to get a more accurate picture, it is worth using the whole previous year as a comparison, when net sales were EUR 35.8 million and EBITDA was EUR -0.8 million (-2.2% of net sales). Our strong growth continues to maintain pressure to control cost increases and realize economies of scale in production and deliveries. The efforts to improve profitability will continue. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged: the company's revenue will grow strongly compared to 2024, and EBITDA will be EUR 1–3 million. Solid order intake The green transition, electrification and growth in automation are strong trends that support sales both in Finland and internationally. Growth has been particularly strong in Finnish energy storage projects, and the need for investment is also reflected in the energy efficiency targets of the metal industry. Our order intake was at a strong level at the end of June: EUR 29.3 (46.8) million. The value of new orders in the first half of the year was EUR 26.2 (39.7) million. Our energy storage strategy is yielding results. During the reporting period, we delivered Finland's largest energy storage facility at the time, with a capacity of 38 MW/43 MWh, to Lappeenrannan Energia and eNordic. Our partnership was further strengthened by a follow-up order for another 30 MW/30 MWh energy storage system to be delivered to eNordic and Ardian. During the review period, we also completed several long-term delivery agreements, which were transferred to our lifecycle services, and our cooperation with our customers continues with the support of our service business. In the power quality business, a large active filter order for Egypt still accounts for a significant portion of our order intake. In addition, orders for compensators for the steel industry balance our order intake and its product range. Organization and product development support growth and profitability Our growth has been determined and based on our strong expertise in energy storage and power quality. We are also involved in the market by developing our own energy storage projects, where we can leverage both our technological expertise and our comprehensive understanding of the market. As a result, we can offer our customers the best returns and minimize Merus Power's risks through cost-effective and optimized implementation. We have built both our organization and our technology with a long-term focus on modular and scalable solutions. During the reporting period, we have seen clear evidence of the scalability of both our modular solutions and our expertise. Our number of employees grew by 24 to 151 in the first half of the year. The systematic growth of our personnel strengthens our ability to implement our growth strategy and ensure that we can deliver on our customer promises in the future. Investing in our own energy storage system With our own energy storage facility, Merus Power is able to meet product development needs and test the properties of energy storage in a real market environment. This has been a significant investment in the development of technology and services and demonstrates our commitment to market leadership. The development environment enables the continuous optimization of trading services and system operations. At the end of the review period in June, the company carried out a directed share issue to strengthen its equity capital and secure financing and other prerequisites for growth. The successful share issue raised approximately EUR 2.0 million, which will support the company's strategy in the short and medium term by improving profitability.

CEO KARI TUOMALA: IMPROVING PROFITABILITY SUPPORTS STRONG GROWTH In the first half of 2025, our revenue grew strongly to EUR 24.9 (6.7) million. This growth was driven in particular by successful deliveries of modular energy storage solutions in Finland and the delivery of power quality solutions and products to international customers. The development was driven by active demand in both the energy storage business supporting renewable energy and the power quality market, which promotes energy efficiency. During the review period, we succeeded in improving the profitability of the company's operations. We improved the productization of our deliveries, which resulted in greater efficiency in the operations of our own factory. In addition, we were able to leverage the experience and expertise gained from previous deliveries. Our operating margin (EBITDA) for the first half of the year was approximately EUR 0.3 million positive, whereas in the comparison period it was approximately EUR 3.4 million negative. Net sales for the comparison period were exceptionally low, which means that the periods are not entirely comparable. A significant part of the 2024 net sales and margin were recognized in the second half of the year, so to get a more accurate picture, it is worth using the whole previous year as a comparison, when net sales were EUR 35.8 million and EBITDA was EUR -0.8 million (-2.2% of net sales). Our strong growth continues to maintain pressure to control cost increases and realize economies of scale in production and deliveries. The efforts to improve profitability will continue. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged: the company's revenue will grow strongly compared to 2024, and EBITDA will be EUR 1–3 million. Solid order intake The green transition, electrification and growth in automation are strong trends that support sales both in Finland and internationally. Growth has been particularly strong in Finnish energy storage projects, and the need for investment is also reflected in the energy efficiency targets of the metal industry. Our order intake was at a strong level at the end of June: EUR 29.3 (46.8) million. The value of new orders in the first half of the year was EUR 26.2 (39.7) million. Our energy storage strategy is yielding results. During the reporting period, we delivered Finland's largest energy storage facility at the time, with a capacity of 38 MW/43 MWh, to Lappeenrannan Energia and eNordic. Our partnership was further strengthened by a follow-up order for another 30 MW/30 MWh energy storage system to be delivered to eNordic and Ardian. During the review period, we also completed several long-term delivery agreements, which were transferred to our lifecycle services, and our cooperation with our customers continues with the support of our service business. In the power quality business, a large active filter order for Egypt still accounts for a significant portion of our order intake. In addition, orders for compensators for the steel industry balance our order intake and its product range. Organization and product development support growth and profitability Our growth has been determined and based on our strong expertise in energy storage and power quality. We are also involved in the market by developing our own energy storage projects, where we can leverage both our technological expertise and our comprehensive understanding of the market. As a result, we can offer our customers the best returns and minimize Merus Power's risks through cost-effective and optimized implementation. We have built both our organization and our technology with a long-term focus on modular and scalable solutions. During the reporting period, we have seen clear evidence of the scalability of both our modular solutions and our expertise. Our number of employees grew by 24 to 151 in the first half of the year. The systematic growth of our personnel strengthens our ability to implement our growth strategy and ensure that we can deliver on our customer promises in the future. Investing in our own energy storage system With our own energy storage facility, Merus Power is able to meet product development needs and test the properties of energy storage in a real market environment. This has been a significant investment in the development of technology and services and demonstrates our commitment to market leadership. The development environment enables the continuous optimization of trading services and system operations. At the end of the review period in June, the company carried out a directed share issue to strengthen its equity capital and secure financing and other prerequisites for growth. The successful share issue raised approximately EUR 2.0 million, which will support the company's strategy in the short and medium term by improving profitability.

The strong growth led to 12% growth in divisional profit, equaling a divisional profit margin of 36% driven by operating leverage The Enterprise division was – as expected – challenged by market uncertainty due to the global trade environment. The organic revenue growth was -7% due to the market uncertainty and a difficult comparison base, while being supported by strong progress in FalCom. The divisional profit margin ended at 34% as a result of pricing discipline and cost focus, offsetting the direct tariff costs The Gaming division was – as expected – challenged by the tariff environment and weak consumer sentiment. Despite these challenges, Gaming performed well leading to 0% organic revenue growth on top of a very challenging comparison base. The divisional profit margin (excluding wind-down effects) ended at 12% as a result of pricing discipline and one-company supply chain benefits Group reported EBITA increased 46% to DKK 546 million (EBITA margin of 13%), reflecting gross margin improvements, strong cost focus due to the group-wide cost program and no extraordinary costs Free cash flow excl. M&A ended at DKK 353 million reflecting the earnings profile and positive impact on working capital. Net interest-bearing debt ended at DKK 9,850 million, equaling a reported leverage of 4.0x (reported leverage of 4.9x in Q2 2024) Following a successful execution in the first half of the year, and GN’s company-wide agility, the financial guidance for 2025 is confirmed. The organic revenue growth guidance of -3% to +3% (excluding wind-down effects) is narrowed to -2% to +2%. The guidance on EBITA-margin and free cash flow excl. M&A is confirmed Financial guidance for 2025 Organic revenue growth excl. wind-down EBITA margin Free cash flow excl. M&A (DKK million) Updated Prior Confirmed Confirmed -2% to +2% -3% to +3% 11% to 13% ~800 Key revenue assumptions for financial guidance 2025 Hearing division GN is exposed to an attractive hearing aid market, which has historically been growing 4-6% in volumes driven by ongoing favorable demographic trends. With an assumed -1% yearly ASP impact, the structural market value growth assumptions of 3-5%. As a consequence of the slower beginning of the year driven by the uncertain macroeconomic environment, it is currently expected that the market in 2025 will grow slower than its structural trend. Based on the strong sales momentum of ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi, GN in 2025 expects to continue to gain market share. In the beginning of 2025, we assumed the Hearing division to contribute with organic revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Due to the lower market growth assumption, it is currently assumed that the Hearing division will grow at the lower half of that range. Enterprise division The uncertainty and change in the trade environment are impacting our Enterprise division. We have taken significant actions to further diversify our manufacturing footprint to mitigate this, and we have also implemented targeted price adjustments in the US. With these initiatives in place, we are progressing well towards the existing assumptions for the year. In April 2025, we assumed the Enterprise division would contribute with organic revenue growth of -8% to 0%, and we are continuing to assume a contribution in the middle of this range. Gaming division Similar to the Enterprise market, the Gaming market is also impacted by the change in trade environment and general weak consumer sentiment. We have taken several mitigation actions including diversification of our manufacturing footprint and targeted price increases. These initiatives work well. In April 2025, we assumed the Gaming division to contribute with organic revenue growth of -6% to +2% (excluding the impact from the wind-down). Driven by the strong execution in the first half of the year, the Gaming division is now assuming to contribute with organic revenue growth in the upper half of that range. Key EBITA margin assumptions for the financial guidance of 2025 In light of the evolving changes in the global trade environment, GN launched significant mitigating actions in May 2025 to protect Group profitability. These significant actions included but were not limited to 1) Acceleration of diversification of manufacturing footprint; 2) U.S. price increases for Enterprise and Gaming; 3) Group-wide cost and cash initiatives. In the quarter, the changing trade environment has been managed well. The efforts to diversify the supply chain are continuing in line with original plans. Thanks to this diversification, the group-wide cost control efforts and the commercial actions that were taken across Enterprise and Gaming, the overall impact is being mitigated well. We are continuously assessing the developments and additional prudent and diligent actions will be taken as needed going forward. It is currently expected that the net impact from tariffs will impact group EBITA margin by around -1% in 2025 (as earlier communicated), of which around 0.5% has a more temporary effect. Quotes from Executive Management Peter Karlstromer, CEO of GN Store Nord, comments: “ While the macro-economic environment continues to pose challenges to GN and to our customers, we are very pleased with our execution and the progress we are making. In Hearing, our Vivia launch is going very well, leading to market share gains around the world. In Enterprise and Gaming, we have continued the diversification of our supply chain and also taken constructive commercial actions to manage the changing trade environment. We have done this well with limited negative impact while continuing to serve our customers with no disruption. All in all, we are gradually taking ourselves through a challenging period and remain very excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us across our markets and our group. Thanks to all customers, partners and employees for making this possible.” Financial overview Q2 2025 GN Store Nord Hearing division Enterprise division Gaming division Gaming Consumer DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Revenue 4,160 4,499 -8% 1,858 1,792 4% 1,713 1,873 -9% 589 611 -4% 0 223 -100% Organic growth 0%* 5% 8% 10% -7% -1% 0% 12% -100% 3% Gross profit 2,313 2,334 -1% 1,152 1,131 2% 961 1,015 -5% 191 186 3% 9 2 350% Gross profit margin 55.6% 51.9% 3.7%p 62.0% 63.1% -1.1%p 56.1% 54.2% 1.9%p 32.4% 30.4% 2.0%p NA 0.9% NA Divisional profit 1,323 1,239 7% 668 598 12% 583 651 -10% 70 2 Divisional profit margin 31.8% 27.5% 4.3%p 36.0% 33.4% 2.6%p 34.0% 34.8% -0.8%p 11.9% NA EBITA 546 374 46% EBITA margin 13.1% 8.3% 4.8%p Free cash flow excl.

M&A ended at DKK 353 million reflecting the earnings profile and positive impact on working capital. Net interest-bearing debt ended at DKK 9,850 million, equaling a reported leverage of 4.0x (reported leverage of 4.9x in Q2 2024) Following a successful execution in the first half of the year, and GN’s company-wide agility, the financial guidance for 2025 is confirmed.

M&A (DKK million) Updated Prior Confirmed Confirmed -2% to +2% -3% to +3% 11% to 13% ~800 Key revenue assumptions for financial guidance 2025 Hearing division GN is exposed to an attractive hearing aid market, which has historically been growing 4-6% in volumes driven by ongoing favorable demographic trends. With an assumed -1% yearly ASP impact, the structural market value growth assumptions of 3-5%. As a consequence of the slower beginning of the year driven by the uncertain macroeconomic environment, it is currently expected that the market in 2025 will grow slower than its structural trend. Based on the strong sales momentum of ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi, GN in 2025 expects to continue to gain market share. In the beginning of 2025, we assumed the Hearing division to contribute with organic revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Due to the lower market growth assumption, it is currently assumed that the Hearing division will grow at the lower half of that range. Enterprise division The uncertainty and change in the trade environment are impacting our Enterprise division. We have taken significant actions to further diversify our manufacturing footprint to mitigate this, and we have also implemented targeted price adjustments in the US. With these initiatives in place, we are progressing well towards the existing assumptions for the year. In April 2025, we assumed the Enterprise division would contribute with organic revenue growth of -8% to 0%, and we are continuing to assume a contribution in the middle of this range. Gaming division Similar to the Enterprise market, the Gaming market is also impacted by the change in trade environment and general weak consumer sentiment. We have taken several mitigation actions including diversification of our manufacturing footprint and targeted price increases. These initiatives work well. In April 2025, we assumed the Gaming division to contribute with organic revenue growth of -6% to +2% (excluding the impact from the wind-down). Driven by the strong execution in the first half of the year, the Gaming division is now assuming to contribute with organic revenue growth in the upper half of that range. Key EBITA margin assumptions for the financial guidance of 2025 In light of the evolving changes in the global trade environment, GN launched significant mitigating actions in May 2025 to protect Group profitability. These significant actions included but were not limited to 1) Acceleration of diversification of manufacturing footprint; 2) U.S. price increases for Enterprise and Gaming; 3) Group-wide cost and cash initiatives. In the quarter, the changing trade environment has been managed well. The efforts to diversify the supply chain are continuing in line with original plans. Thanks to this diversification, the group-wide cost control efforts and the commercial actions that were taken across Enterprise and Gaming, the overall impact is being mitigated well. We are continuously assessing the developments and additional prudent and diligent actions will be taken as needed going forward. It is currently expected that the net impact from tariffs will impact group EBITA margin by around -1% in 2025 (as earlier communicated), of which around 0.5% has a more temporary effect. Quotes from Executive Management Peter Karlstromer, CEO of GN Store Nord, comments: “ While the macro-economic environment continues to pose challenges to GN and to our customers, we are very pleased with our execution and the progress we are making. In Hearing, our Vivia launch is going very well, leading to market share gains around the world. In Enterprise and Gaming, we have continued the diversification of our supply chain and also taken constructive commercial actions to manage the changing trade environment. We have done this well with limited negative impact while continuing to serve our customers with no disruption. All in all, we are gradually taking ourselves through a challenging period and remain very excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us across our markets and our group. Thanks to all customers, partners and employees for making this possible.” Financial overview Q2 2025 GN Store Nord Hearing division Enterprise division Gaming division Gaming Consumer DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Revenue 4,160 4,499 -8% 1,858 1,792 4% 1,713 1,873 -9% 589 611 -4% 0 223 -100% Organic growth 0%* 5% 8% 10% -7% -1% 0% 12% -100% 3% Gross profit 2,313 2,334 -1% 1,152 1,131 2% 961 1,015 -5% 191 186 3% 9 2 350% Gross profit margin 55.6% 51.9% 3.7%p 62.0% 63.1% -1.1%p 56.1% 54.2% 1.9%p 32.4% 30.4% 2.0%p NA 0.9% NA Divisional profit 1,323 1,239 7% 668 598 12% 583 651 -10% 70 2 Divisional profit margin 31.8% 27.5% 4.3%p 36.0% 33.4% 2.6%p 34.0% 34.8% -0.8%p 11.9% NA EBITA 546 374 46% EBITA margin 13.1% 8.3% 4.8%p Free cash flow excl.

On 30 June 2025, Loan to Value (LTV) including Non-current assets held for sale and related liabilities was 44.4%. Outlook for Kojamo in 2025 Kojamo restates its outlook from stock exchange release published on July 31, 2025. The outlook update was due to the sale of a residential portfolio, as the outlook does not take into account the impact of potential acquisitions and disposals on revenue or on cash flow before changes in working capital (FFO). Kojamo estimates that in 2025, the Group’s total revenue will increase by 0–2 per cent year-on-year. In addition, Kojamo estimates that the Group’s FFO for 2025 will amount to between EUR 135–141 million, excluding non-recurring costs. The outlook is based on the management’s assessment of total revenue, property maintenance expenses and repairs, administrative expenses, financial expenses and taxes to be paid as well as the management’s view on future developments in the operating environment. The outlook takes into account the estimated occupancy rate and development of rents. The total revenue and FFO outlook also takes into account the impacts of disposal of the 44 residential properties, but it does not take into account the impact of potential future acquisitions or disposals. The outlook does not take into account the taxes resulting from the transaction. The management can influence total revenue and FFO through the company’s business operations. In contrast, the management has no influence over market trends, the regulatory environment or the competitive landscape. CEO’s review The growth in total revenue and net rental income continued in the second quarter of the year. FFO decreased which was due to higher financial, maintenance and repair expenses than in comparison period. Our balance sheet has remained strong. Improving the occupancy rate is still our key priority, and robust growth continued during the second quarter. Our financial occupancy rate was 92.8 per cent in the first quarter, and it increased to 94.4 per cent in the second quarter. In June, our occupancy rate already reached 94.8 per cent. There is still oversupply in the rental market, particularly in the capital region. New construction is not expected to increase supply in the near term, as the volume of residential development in Finland has remained at a low level. Although construction companies have started some projects for owner-occupied housing, construction is not anticipated to resume on a broad scale. Based on listings on housing portals, the number of available rental apartments has not yet decreased significantly, but the growth in supply appears to have stalled. Our commitment to customer experience is delivering results. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) reached an all-time high of 58 at the end of June. Customer turnover has also developed positively, declining from the previous year. In June, we signed an agreement to sell a total of 1,944 apartments. The transaction was completed after the review period, at the end of July. The 44 properties being sold are located in eight different municipalities, mainly outside the capital region. As we are strongly focused on Finland’s growth centres, these properties were not aligned with our strategy. The sale of this housing portfolio is in line with our targets for the current year and is, so far, the largest transaction in the Finnish residential market this year. The proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt and for share buybacks, which will strengthen our balance sheet and support the creation of shareholder value. Our financing position is very good. In June, we refinanced a EUR 100 million bank loan with Swedbank maturing next year, thereby extending the maturity profile of our loans. The average interest rate of financing decreased from the end of March. In addition, after the review period in August, we refinanced a EUR 100 million bank loan maturing in 2026 with OP. Our next financing arrangements will focus on loans maturing in 2027. I had the honour of starting as CEO of Kojamo at the beginning of June. I am grateful to everyone at Kojamo for the warm welcome I have received in many different encounters. Kojamo is a strong company – both in terms of its balance sheet and expertise – and it is well positioned to be a forerunner in housing and the number one choice for customers, in line with its vision. Our goal is to create an even better customer experience, with a focus on growth centres.

Group revenue and EBIT in the first half of 2025 were record-high and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 2.3 billion, respectively. This can be compared to the same period last year with DKK 121 million in revenue and DKK -21 million in EBIT. A very significant improvement with the recognition of the upfront payment in the AbbVie-deal as the main explanation. Henrik Blou, CEO of Gubra said: “The first half year has been transformational, in a very positive way. We struck the biggest out-licensing deal so far for Gubra for our Amylin anti-obesity asset GUBamy. The partnership with AbbVie really underscores Gubra’s expertise in the metabolic space and our ability to develop novel peptide-based therapeutics. Following the deal, we decided to distribute DKK 1 billion to shareholders as an extraordinary dividend. A real strength for biotech company to be able to distribute a very meaningful amount back to shareholders while still maintaining sufficient capital to realize our strategy in the coming years. GUBAMY – PROGRESSING AS PLANNED In the second quarter, we published strong interim clinical results from the first part of the Phase 1 Multiple-Ascending-Dose study (MAD). The results exceeded our expectations. The study showed that GUBamy was well tolerated with adverse events being predominantly GI related, mild and consistent with data from the previous Single-Ascending-Dose study (SAD). On weight reduction, GUBamy delivered a remarkable weight loss. Once-weekly administration for six weeks of 1 mg or 2 mg GUBamy led to a dose dependent mean weight loss compared to a weight gain in the placebo group. LS Mean weight loss in the 2 mg cohort was -7.8% compared to an LS Mean weight gain of +2.0% in the placebo arm on day 43. The MAD study for testing higher doses during a longer treatment period is ongoing and is progressing as planned. As part of having AbbVie as partner, we are delighted to see them expanding development options in the study. Their experience and scale make a real difference. ADVANCING OUR UCN2 OBESITY PROGRAM We are equally enthusiastic about our next-in-line internal obesity program, UCN2, which is designed to promote a high-quality weight loss. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that UCN2 analogues, when administered alone, selectively reduce fat mass and simultaneously promote gains in lean body mass. When combined with other anti-obesity agents, UCN2 has shown the unique ability to completely prevent the loss of lean mass typically seen in diet-induced obese rats treated with agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Notably, UCN2 has also been shown to fully reverse the lean mass loss caused by prior semaglutide treatment. This positions UCN2 as a potentially valuable component in combination regimens, acting both as a protective and restorative agent. Beyond its metabolic effects, treatment with long-acting UCN2 analogues has resulted in improvements in cardiac and kidney function in preclinical models of chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. UCN2 is now being prepared for Phase 1 clinical study to start early 2026. GROUP REVENUE AND EARNINGS UP VERY SIGNIFICANTLY Group revenue and EBIT in the first half of 2025 were record-high and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 2.3 billion, respectively. This can be compared to the same period last year with DKK 121 million in revenue and DKK -21 million in EBIT. A very significant improvement with the recognition of the upfront payment in the AbbVie-deal as the main explanation. CRO BUSINESS – REVENUE SLIGHTLY BEHIND LAST YEAR Our CRO business has grown very significantly over the last two years and revenue has by far outpaced our mid-term annual growth guidance of 10%. In Q2 2025, we reported revenue of DKK 55 million which is 12% up compared to Q2 2024. However, H1 2025 revenue is 2% behind H1 2024, i.e. somewhat below our expectations. The explanation being the US market where we generally see longer decision timelines among our customers. The development in Europe is on the contrary very healthy with high growth in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. As a result of the slowdown we experience in the US, we have adjusted our full-year 2025 outlook for CRO revenue to be slightly below the revenue level in 2024 (previously 10-20% growth). EBIT- margin expectation for full-year 2025 for the CRO business has been reduced to around 20% (previously 25-31%). HANDING OVER THE BATON TO INCOMING CEO After almost 10 years in Gubra it is time for me now to hand over the baton to a new incoming CEO. I am really excited and proud of what we have achieved that has propelled Gubra into a completely different league. I have always admired leaders who found an appropriate point in time to step back, and I feel that now is the right time. I genuinely wish to thank the founders, the Board and our shareholders for all the trust and also all the fantastic colleagues that have brought Gubra to where we are today. It feels incredibly rewarding to leave the company in such a strong position, with significant potential still ahead, as Markus Rohrwild takes over as CEO starting September 8, 2025.” Key financial highlights for Q2 2025 Key ratio CRO segment D&P segment Group DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Revenue 54.9 49.0 2,379.7 6.6 2,434.6 55.6 Organic revenue growth 12% 18% 35956% -38% 4279% 7% Reported Cost of Sales & Opex -41.3 -38.9 -124.3 -36.2 -165.9 -75.3 Adj.

During the first half of 2025 we've seen significant scale-up, automation and industrialization achievements on both our small molecule and biologics technology platforms, new patents have been granted, proposals sent & projects won continued to grow, likewise revenue and other income. Customer payments year-to-date, including the first milestone payments related to our product kernels already exceed last year's revenues, costs are down and our cash burn has continued to improve steadily. The discussions and work around our product kernels continue with existing and prospective partners and we are pleased with Business Finland's decision to grant us a loan to support our development of Nanoapalutamide. We received the first preliminary results from the first arm of the pivotal clinical study of nanoenzalutamide. The results demonstrated that nanoenzalutamide in fasted study subjects showed matching plasma concentration compared to the reference product, and slightly low peak plasma concentration. Nanoform and the ONConcept ® consortium’s initial assessment is that the results are supportive for nanoenzalutamide to progress to the markets underpinned by an adjusted regulatory strategy. These new clinical results strengthen our understanding of how the nanoforming technology performs in human biology and its potential to deliver patient-centric therapies. Reducing high initial plasma concentrations whilst still achieving similar bioavailability as amorphous solid dispersions can be a significant benefit in oral drug delivery. I'm pleased by the fact that our Biologics technology offering continues to garner increased interest from the pharma industry. Takeda presented results related to their project with Nanoform's Biologics technology at the Drug Delivery Forum in Berlin. The presentation entitled, “A Novel Nanoformed Presentation of AAT for the Treatment of Pulmonary Emphysema in AAT Deficient Patients,” showed nanoforming as an alternative administration strategy for an AAT replacement therapy, based on a novel solidification platform from Nanoform. Their comparison with other methods such as spray drying showed that the nanoformed particulate material could deposit significantly higher amounts of AAT within the alveolar system. At the same forum Nanoform presented the successful generation of nanotrastuzumab, a high concentration nanoformulation of trastuzumab, suitable for subcutaneous injection, enabling more than 400mg/ml dose in a single 2mL syringe, instead of intravenous injections. During the past year we've worked on more than 40 different customer projects. These cover both small molecules and biologics, and range across multiple therapy areas and delivery methods. I remain encouraged by the broad applicability of our nanoparticles and nanoformulations. Not all customer projects progress, for many reasons, however, the momentum I see in many of these projects and the fact that our customers return makes me confident that we will see some of these ongoing customer projects enter the clinic. This dynamic validates our strategy to work with many different companies and APIs, to not become dependent on any single project. For Nanoform the last years have been about making large investments and building a capable organization. The coming years is about preparing to launch nanoformed products together with partners onto the global markets. We are ready for the challenge. I look forward with confidence and excitement to the coming years. None of this can be done without our amazing employees and great partners. My sincere THANK YOU to you all for your continued dedication to Nanoform and for the inspiring and innovative work for which we’re known. Best Regards, Prof. Edward Hæggström, CEO Nanoform Significant events during 1-6/2025 In January our R&D team further scaled-up the CESS® technology by a factor 20x on nanoenzalutamide, indicating that after tech-transfer into GMP, we will be ready for the estimated 1000kg+ commercial demand when launched globally. This technology development also supports the commercial needs of nanoapalutamide and nanoencorafenib. In March, a new US global major pharma company was signed. At the end of March we filed for a commercial license for nanoenzalutamide to Fimea. In March a lead investor signed a term sheet around nanoencorafenib. During the quarter we successfully implemented and went live with TrackWise eQMS (digital quality management system). Nanoform has earlier filed patent applications for its small molecule controlled crystallization platform that produces crystalline polymer embedded nanoparticles (cPENs TM ). During the first quarter the first patent family member was granted in the United States by the USPTO. This is evidence for the significant opportunity Nanoform has to generate valuable IP leveraging its platforms for nanoformulations and products. The cPEN TM formulation platform is utilized for nanoenzalutamide, nanoapalutamide, and nanoencorafenib, among other internal and ongoing customer projects Nanoform's AGM was held on April 15, 2025. 42 shareholders representing 58.9% of all outstanding shares and votes were represented at the meeting (for more information see section AGM decisions). In April, Nanoform won a new grant from the Gates Foundation to work on several of the foundation’s drug development projects. In April, our Bio R&D team achieved a 10x scale-up of our Biologics technology, by producing 2kg in one continuous run on our pilot GMP line. This supports our efforts to show the commercial value the technology can bring to the fast growing field of high-concentration subcutaneous injections of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). In April we successfully concluded our GMP campaign of nanoenzalutamide. 100kg material was produced and shipped to Bluepharma, where hundreds of thousands of tablets are produced. This successful campaign has resulted in a validated process for nanoenzalutamide. This supports our upcoming regulatory filings. In May Nanoform signed a letter of intent to establish, in collaboration with two specialist healthcare investors, BRAFMed Ltd, a new company to progress the clinical development and outlicensing of Nanoencorafenib In June Takeda presented results related to their project with Nanoform's Biologics technology at the Drug Delivery Forum in Berlin. The presentation entitled “A Novel Nanoformed Presentation of AAT for the Treatment of Pulmonary Emphysema in AAT Deficient Patients,” shared results from the study, which investigated Nanoformed A1AT, a respirable dry powder for inhalation, as an alternative administration strategy for an AAT replacement therapy, based on a novel solidification platform from Nanoform. Inhaled A1AT could help achieving much higher A1AT levels in the epithelium lining fluid while offering a more patient centric formulation. In June at DDF in Berlin Nanoform presented the successful generation of nanotrastuzumab, a high concentration nanoformulation of trastuzumab, suitable for subcutaneous injection, enabling more than 400mg/ml dose in a single 2mL syringe, instead of intravenous injections. In June Nanoform announced that it together with its ONConcept® Consortium partners (Bluepharma, Helm, Welding) had started pivotal relative bioequivalence studies of Nanoenzalutamide. The purpose of the studies (fed/fasted, EU&US) is to achieve bioequivalence for a single nanoformed 160 mg tablet dose with four Xtandi® 40 mg film-coated tablets. In June Business Finland approved a EUR 5m R&D loan to support the clinical development of nanoapalutamide, The loan covers up to 50% of the costs associated with the clinical development program through to the pivotal bioequivalence study. The interest rate on the loan is three percentage points below the base interest rate, or at least one percent, and no collateral is required. The loan period is ten years. During the first five years only interest is paid. Significant events after 1-6/2025 In August Nanoform received the first preliminary results from the first arm of the pivotal clinical study of nanoenzalutamide, a nanocrystalline-enabled tablet formulation of enzalutamide developed using Nanoform’s proprietary CESS ® technology. Nanoenzalutamide is being developed in partnership with the ONConcept ® Consortium (Bluepharma, Helm, Welding). This read-out was from the first arm of the pivotal study, a single-dose, randomized, open-label, parallel, bioequivalence study of nanoenzalutamide 160 mg film-coated tablets and Xtandi® (enzalutamide) 4 x 40 mg film-coated tablets (Astellas Pharma Europe B.V.) in healthy male volunteers under fasting conditions. The results demonstrated that nanoenzalutamide in fasted study subjects showed matching plasma concentration (“AUC”) compared to the reference product, and slightly low peak plasma concentration (“Cmax”). Nanoform and the ONConcept ® consortium’s initial assessment is that the results are supportive for nanoenzalutamide to progress to the markets underpinned by an adjusted regulatory strategy. The ongoing clinical study continues with dosing under fed conditions as planned. Nanoform and ONConcept ® remain confident that the unique patient-centric crystalline one tablet formulation will offer an attractive product for partners and patients, with the opportunity to potentially launch prior to other generic products relying on the amorphous solid dispersion formulation that is patent protected until 2033. Nanoform does not currently expect there to be material changes to earlier volume- and commercial estimates provided in connection with Nanoform’s 1Q report. Company near-term business targets for 2025 To sign development and license/commercial supply agreements on several product kernels during 2025 First pivotal bioequivalence study with nanoformed medicine Increased number of non-GMP and GMP projects signed in 2025 vs 2024 Improved free cash flow in 2025 vs 2024 Company mid-term business targets 2030 To be announced during 2025 in conjunction with Capital Markets Day.

On 30 June 2025, Loan to Value (LTV) including Non-current assets held for sale and related liabilities was 44.4%. Outlook for Kojamo in 2025 Kojamo restates its outlook from stock exchange release published on July 31, 2025. The outlook update was due to the sale of a residential portfolio, as the outlook does not take into account the impact of potential acquisitions and disposals on revenue or on cash flow before changes in working capital (FFO). Kojamo estimates that in 2025, the Group’s total revenue will increase by 0–2 per cent year-on-year. In addition, Kojamo estimates that the Group’s FFO for 2025 will amount to between EUR 135–141 million, excluding non-recurring costs. The outlook is based on the management’s assessment of total revenue, property maintenance expenses and repairs, administrative expenses, financial expenses and taxes to be paid as well as the management’s view on future developments in the operating environment. The outlook takes into account the estimated occupancy rate and development of rents. The total revenue and FFO outlook also takes into account the impacts of disposal of the 44 residential properties, but it does not take into account the impact of potential future acquisitions or disposals. The outlook does not take into account the taxes resulting from the transaction. The management can influence total revenue and FFO through the company’s business operations. In contrast, the management has no influence over market trends, the regulatory environment or the competitive landscape. CEO’s review The growth in total revenue and net rental income continued in the second quarter of the year. FFO decreased which was due to higher financial, maintenance and repair expenses than in comparison period. Our balance sheet has remained strong. Improving the occupancy rate is still our key priority, and robust growth continued during the second quarter. Our financial occupancy rate was 92.8 per cent in the first quarter, and it increased to 94.4 per cent in the second quarter. In June, our occupancy rate already reached 94.8 per cent. There is still oversupply in the rental market, particularly in the capital region. New construction is not expected to increase supply in the near term, as the volume of residential development in Finland has remained at a low level. Although construction companies have started some projects for owner-occupied housing, construction is not anticipated to resume on a broad scale. Based on listings on housing portals, the number of available rental apartments has not yet decreased significantly, but the growth in supply appears to have stalled. Our commitment to customer experience is delivering results. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) reached an all-time high of 58 at the end of June. Customer turnover has also developed positively, declining from the previous year. In June, we signed an agreement to sell a total of 1,944 apartments. The transaction was completed after the review period, at the end of July. The 44 properties being sold are located in eight different municipalities, mainly outside the capital region. As we are strongly focused on Finland’s growth centres, these properties were not aligned with our strategy. The sale of this housing portfolio is in line with our targets for the current year and is, so far, the largest transaction in the Finnish residential market this year. The proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt and for share buybacks, which will strengthen our balance sheet and support the creation of shareholder value. Our financing position is very good. In June, we refinanced a EUR 100 million bank loan with Swedbank maturing next year, thereby extending the maturity profile of our loans. The average interest rate of financing decreased from the end of March. In addition, after the review period in August, we refinanced a EUR 100 million bank loan maturing in 2026 with OP. Our next financing arrangements will focus on loans maturing in 2027. I had the honour of starting as CEO of Kojamo at the beginning of June. I am grateful to everyone at Kojamo for the warm welcome I have received in many different encounters. Kojamo is a strong company – both in terms of its balance sheet and expertise – and it is well positioned to be a forerunner in housing and the number one choice for customers, in line with its vision. Our goal is to create an even better customer experience, with a focus on growth centres.

We see standard software for government evolving into a large industry, challenging the dominance of traditional suppliers. With more than 15 years of experience, a strong product position, and solid customer references, we look confidently toward the next decade. We aim to take a leadership position within the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for government industry, and we have refined our strategy accordingly. Our dual go-to-market approach balances depth with focus: we continue to build our core business around large account customers (“super accounts”), while in parallel pursuing global leadership in selected niches where F2 becomes a category-defining standard. With F2, we are shaping the future of COTS for government. Our product roadmap is driven by a unique technology position: a complete and fully integrated platform, standard software purpose-built for government, while offering easy configuration to meet customer requirements without any modification to the core software. We maintain our full year guidance Revenue for the first half of 2025 amounts to DKK 132 million, this is down 5% from DKK 139 million in the same period of 2024. Earnings before tax (EBT) total DKK 31 million, corresponding to an EBT margin of 24%. Software revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 100 million, a decrease of 10% compared to DKK 111 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower international license sales. Revenue from one-time software licenses declined by 58%, making up 14% of total revenue. Services revenue increased by 15% to DKK 32 million, representing 24% of total revenue. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) grew by 24% and represent 61% of total revenue, up from approximately 47% last year. While revenue for the first half of the year was lower due to a decline in one-time software license sales, we are encouraged by the solid performance of recurring revenue streams. The first half demonstrates a strong underlying business, with subscriptions growing 24% and services revenue increasing 15%. In addition, the solid EBT margin of 24% generated a strong positive operating cash flow of DKK 40 million. The one-time software license decline, reflects timing-related factors and market-specific delays. Given the short delivery cycles for one-time licenses, revenue is directly impacted by fluctuations in procurement schedules. In the second quarter, some Danish government organizations postponed procurements due to internal planning processes and resort changes, affecting the timing of recognized revenue. Similar to Denmark, delays in international projects have impacted results, representing a key driver of lower one-time license revenue. We maintain our full-year guidance, growing revenue 10-15% with an EBT margin of 18-23%. For the second half, we forecast continued growth in recurring licenses, and expect one-time licenses to reach a level that secures the same total volume of one-time licenses in 2025 as in 2024. In Denmark, we expect postponed procurements to be completed. Internationally, we anticipate projects across the USA, Germany, the UAE, and Africa to drive growth in one-time license revenue. Focused on long-term growth through strategic investments During the spring, cBrain (NASDAQ: CBRAIN) has taken internal steps to strengthen its organization with the aim of taking a leadership position in the fast-emerging global market for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for governments. This includes developing go-to-market strategies and establishing dedicated teams to build and lead global niches such as paperless ministry and environmental permitting. During the first half year, cBrain has been able to report progress in both verticals, with the Kenyan ministry of ICT running a pilot project and supporting the new U.S. government standard for environmental permitting. We believe the global COTS for government opportunity is significant. We have therefore also adopted a long-term perspective, even if this may affect short-term performance. cBrain has the financial strength to execute on this strategy. These changes have influenced the first half results, as we are reallocating project resources. In the beginning of the year, we allocated extra costs of 30 million DKK to support the organizational development and market investments. Until now we have allocated a smaller part of these investments, and we continue to evaluate opportunities. Thriving toward global leadership in the Paperless Ministry market The setup and configuration of cBrain F2 ® for ministries, used by Danish ministries as their digital platform, is referred to as the Paperless Ministry solution. A key pillar of the expanded growth strategy is to replicate the Danish success, and with Denmark ranked number one in the United Nations E-Government Survey for the past eight years, cBrain holds a strong reference position when exporting the Paperless Ministry solution. By establishing beachheads in new international markets, based on a vertical go-to-market approach centered around the Paperless Ministry offering, the goal is to achieve global niche leadership and secure a strong foundation for future growth. To support this, cBrain is building an internal team, dedicated to export the F2 Paperless Ministry solution globally. During the first half year, cBrain has taken a number of important steps in the market. In Kenya, cBrain has successfully configured F2 for the Kenyan ICT Ministry, ready-to-go live within only 10 weeks. This was achieved by copying and adapting the F2 configuration used by the Danish ministries. In June, the Kenyan ICT Ministry revealed plans to roll out the F2 digital platform across all government departments, thereby transitioning into paperless working environments. The Kenyan project stands out as a strong reference for cBrain when engaging with potential ministerial customers in other parts of the world. Working in close collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP, cBrain plans to market the African version of the F2 Paperless Ministry across Africa. Many African government organizations focus on digitization as a key driver of GDP growth and as a foundation for building accountable and sustainable institutions. With the African Paperless Ministry solution, configured and proven through the Danish-Kenyan ministerial collaboration, cBrain now offers the African region a unique, secure, and fast track to digital transformation, while addressing a large number of potential government customers. During the spring, cBrain has further developed the collaboration with the UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi, and in March cBrain presented the African initiatives, which are closely aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, at the United Nations Science and Technology conference in New York. cBrain has a special focus on Germany and has established initial contacts with a number of German ministries at both federal and regional level. The new German government leadership has a strong focus on digitization, and cBrain believes that reusing Danish government experiences can help accelerate German government digital transformation. In Denmark, cBrain recently announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality to deliver the paperless ministry solution for one of the municipality departments. This agreement indicates a larger market, beyond the initial focus at federal ministries, delivering the paperless ministry solution for local government. Advancing digital sovereignty with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs Driven by the new and rapidly changing global geopolitical situation, digital sovereignty is becoming increasingly important for governments across the world. During the spring, cBrain entered into collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the government’s ambition of strengthening digital sovereignty. As part of this initiative, the Ministry launched a pilot project to test the use of open-source document editing integrated into the cBrain F2 platform. Technically, the cBrain F2 platform is built on an open architecture that separates data from editing tools. This design supports digital sovereignty by giving government users the freedom to use multiple types of editing software in parallel. The project is driven by the political objective of reducing dependency on international software vendors. Leveraging F2’s open architecture, the pilot enables ministry staff to work with open-source editing tools such as Collabora, while ensuring full data integrity, template compliance, and seamless collaboration across environments. Through this work, cBrain demonstrates how F2 supports digital sovereignty by offering governments an open and flexible platform that allows freedom of choice regarding editing tools, without compromising on security. The outcome of this pilot may serve as a blueprint for other ministries in Denmark and abroad, further strengthening cBrain’s position as a trusted partner for governments seeking independence in their digital infrastructures. Building a global Environmental Permitting market vertical As a second pillar of its expanded growth strategy, cBrain has identified environmental permitting as a key international vertical, aiming to establish a leading global position in this market with the cBrain F2 Environmental Permitting solution. The importance of environmental assessment and permitting grows globally, and governments are increasingly requiring robust review and approval processes for infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, mines, factories, and power plants. This trend creates a significant market opportunity for cBrain. In collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cBrain has developed a fully digital permitting solution based on the cBrain F2 platform. This solution replaces traditional paper-based applications, reduces case processing times, and enhances both quality and transparency. In July 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a report to Congress that assesses and recommends technologies to improve environmental reviews and permitting processes. In this report, the cBrain F2 Platform was highlighted as a successful process and AI tool for environmental permitting. To support international scaling, cBrain has formed a dedicated team focused on exporting the F2 Environmental Permitting solution and views environmental permitting as a strategic entry point into the U.S. market. cBrain seeks to capitalize on first-mover advantage in the environmental permitting market The White House issued in April 2025 an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to adopt digital technologies to streamline environmental permitting. 30 days later, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released the Permitting Technology Action Plan and introduced a new set of federal data standards for digital permitting systems. cBrain has rapidly configured its F2 Environmental Permitting solution to align with these standards and, in July 2025, cBrain demonstrated the adapted solution to U.S. federal authorities in Washington, D.C. cBrain believes it is among the very first vendors to support the new CEQ standards. This early alignment provides a first-mover advantage, and cBrain is experiencing an increased interest in its permitting technology as federal and state agencies are seeking to provide answers to political demand for faster permitting through digital modernization. Continued success in Denmark The Danish market represents a strong international reference position for cBrain, today serving more than 75 Danish government organizations with a large catalog of citizen-facing solutions, from tax solutions and auditing to grants management, inspections, licensing, and family affairs. cBrain continues to win market shares in Denmark. New Danish Ministry ready to go live within 3 Weeks In January, cBrain announced an agreement to deliver the F2 Paperless Ministry solution for the new Danish Ministry of Resilience and Preparedness. F2 ministry solution was installed and configured, ready to go live in only 3 weeks. This project demonstrates the power of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for government solutions. Using traditional software solution architectures, digitizing an entire ministry normally takes years and often fails. In contrast, the cBrain F2 platform offers a secure and cost efficient solution that can be easily configured to support fast track digital transformation within a matter of weeks. Demonstrating the speed of delivery and expanding the Danish reference position directly supports the aim to take global leadership, supplying the F2 Paperless Ministry solution. Danish Energy Agency goes live with heat pump grant system, approving first applications in minutes With references across multiple Danish agencies, cBrain is building a solid market position supplying F2 based solutions for grant management. In March, the Danish Energy Agency successfully launched its new digital grant management approval system for the heat pump subsidy program, delivering fast and efficient results beyond expectations. The new grant management solution is based on the cBrain F2 platform, which has been configured to support, all steps end-to-end, from self-service to case processing, evaluation, and filing. According to agency executives the system exceeded all expectations. During the first minutes, the F2 Based solution automatically granted approval to 930 of the applicants. Due to automated case processing steps, combined with automated integrations into multiple national registers, the grant process has been fully automated for the majority of applications. Now only cases that need more information and special evaluation require manual interaction. The successful launch of the heat pump subsidy system underscores how smart technology, like the F2 COTS for government platform, can support faster, smarter, and more effective public services, accelerating Denmark’s green transition. Third largest Danish Municipality implements the F2 Paperless Ministry solution Early July, cBrain announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality. cBrain will deliver F2 as a digital platform to the Urban and Rural Affairs Department in Aalborg Municipality. This administration is responsible for areas including urban development, construction, infrastructure, mobility and nature, and the implementation is expected to be completed within 6–8 weeks, with a planned go-live by September/October 2025. With this agreement, cBrain is now delivering the F2 platform for the three largest municipalities in Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Fully integrated and delivered out-of-the-box, cBrain F2 supports executive decision-making, formal and informal communication, case management, workflows, and compliance. Today, Copenhagen represents the largest deployment, with more than 3,000 users. The agreement with Aalborg highlights that the F2 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Government Platform is gaining traction not only among national ministries and agencies but also within large, complex local government organizations. Local governments thereby represent a significant market opportunity beyond the initial central government focus on Paperless Ministry, extending the reach of the cBrain F2 Paperless Government Platform to cities and local authorities internationally. In Denmark, cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution for the Danish Agency for Green Transition and Aquatic Environment. Delivered as one fully integrated platform, F2 has been configured to support all user requirements functionality, end-to-end. Highly automated, this includes self-service and portal for more than 180,000 hunters, a registry of hunters, case processing related to issuing hunting license, managing different hunting tests for different types of weapons, game harvest reporting, police security checks, and license payments. The project demonstrates the breadth of the F2 COTS for government platform. Delivered as one fully integrated solution, F2 is able to support national registers, case processing, self-service and mass operations such as billing and payment collection. F2 for Partners The F2-for-Partners strategy is a core element of the long-term growth plan. By establishing an ecosystem of partners and customers who manage the consulting work related to implementing and servicing F2 solutions, cBrain can scale its business without revenue growth being directly constrained by the burden of organizational expansion. At the core of this strategy are the F2 Service Builder no-code configuration tools. The F2 Service Builder allows local partners and governments to independently design and build F2-based government solutions. Solutions are configured using a spreadsheet interface, enabling users without a technical background to create solutions. The configured solutions are stored as open source definitions in so-called process libraries. The combination of open source and process libraries makes it easy to reuse solutions simply by copying and adapting the process definition source code. The F2 Service Builder technology thus enables rapid development and reuse, helping governments accelerate digital transformation and scale solutions efficiently. Working with UNDP, aligning with the Digital offer for Africa strategy In November 2024, UNDP and cBrain signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, the partnership aims to accelerate digital transformation of governments and their citizens in the African region. During the spring, cBrain has initiated an F2 process library at UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi. Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars. When the partnership was announced, Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa Director, stated: “Digital is the lifeline to opportunity in Africa, and it should not remain a luxury. With the right partners like Denmark and cBrain, we can expand critical access to information and education, and unlock innovation at scale, thus bridging divides and empowering millions to shape a more equal and prosperous future in Africa”. In parallel, the Ambassador of Denmark in Nairobi, Stephan Schönemann, stated: “cBrain is a leading Danish software company, promoting digitalization as a driver for good governance. Their collaboration with UNDP can help drive the sustainable development and digital transformation across the African continent. This collaboration echoes the spirit of the Danish government’s new Africa strategy which places a strong emphasis on technology, public-private partnerships, democracy, and knowledge sharing”. First large scale project in Romania In December 2024, cBrain’s partner in Romania, Wing Leading Edge, has won a public tender to deliver a new national platform for administering citizen pensions. The solution is being delivered in the Romanian language, with cBrain operating as a sub-supplier. Using the F2 Service Builder and process libraries, F2 is now being configured as the case management and processing core, supporting close to 100 different administrative processes and integrating with multiple other systems. cBrain sees the Romanian pension project as a milestone both technically and strategically. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the F2 Service Builder and process library technology, and it highlights the early success of the F2-for-Partners strategy. F2 AI Assistant offers government AI on premise AI is emerging as a transformative technology for governments worldwide. For cBrain, AI is not a separate product but an integrated part of our strategy to deliver Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for government. We embed AI directly into the F2 platform, ensuring that it supports caseworkers and managers in their daily work, and due to our unique technology, the F2 Assistant runs on premise, thereby safeguarding the principles of security, transparency, and data sovereignty. We continue to develop the F2 AI Assistant, adding new capabilities during the first half new capability. Operating fully within the secure F2 environment, the AI Assistant can summarize documents, propose case-relevant actions, and support knowledge sharing across organizations, always under the control and without compromising sovereignty. We see AI not only as a driver of efficiency but also as a catalyst for redefining digital government operations, further strengthening F2 as a category-defining standard in the global COTS software for government industry. Shaping the future of government software Already into the last quarters of our 2023–2025 growth plan, we are very encouraged by the progress. With a strong product position and strong customers references, supported by a solid financial position, we see cBrain well-positioned for the decade ahead. We are confident that our strategy, built on taking leadership in COTS for government industry, will enable us to capture the opportunities of a fast-emerging market and secure long-term, sustainable growth.

Tornator's vision is to continue balanced growth also in the coming years Half-year report – stock exchange release, 22 August 2025 at 3.00 pm Tornator grows and creates value sustainably – Group revenue increased by 23% Tornator’s vision is to continue balanced growth also in the coming years SUMMARY 1 JAN – 30 JUNE 2025 (1 JAN – 30 JUNE 2024) Net Sales increased by 22.8% to a record €104.5 million (€85.1). The volume of wood deliveries remained at the same level as the comparison period, but strong demand for wood raised unit prices. Operative operating profit also reached a new record of €74.3 million (€60.0). Reported IFRS operating profit was €84.4 million (€60.8). The company continued to acquire forest estates in Finland. Nearly 12,000 hectares of new forest were acquired, with total investments amounting to approximately €60 million. IFRS profit at fair value for the reporting period was €57.7 million (€40.1). The change in fair value of financial instruments was -€0.5 million (+€1.1) before taxes. The change in fair value of standing timber was +€5.6 million before taxes (-€0.5). Comparable return on equity was 4.4% (3.5), and at fair value 5.1% (3.7). The equity ratio was 59.2% (60.1). In the updated vision, Tornator’s goal is to grow the company’s forest assets to one million hectares (+25%) by 2035. Annual revenue is expected to double to over €400 million. The vision includes clear targets for increasing dividends, overall sustainability of operations, and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As part of its 10-year biodiversity programme, the company restored 221 hectares of peatlands and conducted controlled burning on 13 hectares of forest.

We aim to build future success by deepening partnerships and sustainable growth-related themes that have previously proven effective. Our updated growth strategy is built on three pillars: quality, added value, and nature . At the heart of the strategy is human well-being, as behind every achievement there is a motivated workforce and a responsibly operating partner network. In the midst of geopolitical and global economic turbulence, the importance of strategic partnerships in core business operations is emphasized. Collaboration with our main customer, Stora Enso, has been close and diverse already for a long time. This partnership and solution-oriented approach were reflected in strong results in both timber sales and silviculture services during the first half of 2025. Timber market prices continued to rise in Finland due to high demand, and Tornator achieved over €100 million in revenue for the first time during the January–June period. The outlook for demand for renewable and sustainably produced wood raw material remains positive. In silviculture services, system changes by a seedling supplier caused delays in planting, but thanks to hard work, the organization overcame the challenges and increased revenue. We continued forest acquisitions, and Tornator’s forest area in Finland grew by nearly 12,000 hectares. In wind and solar energy, the market appears to be in a waiting mode; uncertainty stems from legislative changes and questions about the scale of energy use, as industrial-scale investments progress slowly. Nevertheless, Tornator received several inquiries in the spring regarding land lease agreements for renewable energy, battery storage, and data center needs. Time will tell how this development unfolds and what added value opportunities arise for a major landowner. The path chosen by Tornator in creating and implementing its own climate and biodiversity programs has been the right decision to ensure healthy, well-growing forests. Political fluctuations are particularly unsuitable for long-term forestry that goes on beyond generations. In 2025, the European Commission has continued its active approach to regulate the forestry sector. Although the EU does not have a common forest policy, forestry is influenced particularly through climate, environmental, and biodiversity objectives. The polarized debate on forest legislation seems to continue, and no one can say for sure what kind of EU-level or national regulation we will see in the coming years. Systematic Development of Contractor Chain Quality From a social responsibility perspective, it is important to ensure good working conditions throughout the value chain. Therefore, making the contractor chain more responsible is one of our key focus areas. The client must take full responsibility for the sustainable treatment of the workforce, whether domestic or foreign. We train and support contractors in fulfilling their employer obligations and have created multilingual forest management and occupational safety guidelines, as well as online courses for foreign workers. As a client, we actively monitor the supply chain and intervene in any neglect. In spring, we launched intensive monitoring of continuous contracting throughout the work season, with results to be reported later in the autumn. Nature Values Considered in Daily Operations and Special Programs The cooperation agreement signed in January 2025 with WWF Finland demonstrates Tornator’s commitment to improving the environmental sustainability of forestry. The three-year partnership includes a unique project in Finland to improve the water impact of forestry at the catchment area level. Alongside long-term development work, we also achieved concrete results in our biodiversity program, with annual reports available on our website. We also announced our intention to apply for our own PEFC certificate to replace the group certificate. This will allow us to better develop our operations and contractor quality through direct cooperation with the auditor. Our own certificate will increase both internal and external PEFC audits annually. Strong Relationships with Financial Markets To secure growth financing, Tornator has built and maintained strong and diverse relationships with financiers. The company ensures timely communication of information and insights to credit banks and debt investors. Tornator prepares well in advance for significant loan refinancing, reducing market risk related to maturity dates. During the second half of the year, refinancing of loans maturing in 2026 will be announced. Thanks to interest rate hedging, changes in market rates do not fully affect the company’s loan interest costs. New Vision 2035: “One Million Hectares” Over the next decade, Tornator aims to make growth investments that will result in owning and managing one million hectares of forest by 2035—an increase of approximately 25% in area. We expect revenue to double to over €400 million. The main focus of growth is in Finland and timber sales, but we also anticipate other value creation opportunities, such as silviculture services and property development. The vision includes a clear commitment to increasing dividends, ensuring overall sustainability, and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. Tornator’s vision means more job opportunities and tax revenue in Eastern Finland, which is struggling with economic challenges. The company’s forests will continue to play a major role as a source of renewable raw material and in securing Finland’s security of supply. New forest estates will also be included in dual certification, and there will be more opportunities for biodiversity-enhancing actions such as peatland restoration and controlled burning, carried out by professionals. Tornator is one of the few companies in Europe capable of sustainably acquiring and managing forest assets of this scale. Under one roof, we have expertise in forest resource analysis, forest property acquisition and financing, forestry planning and operations, timber sales and silviculture services, environmental matters, advanced digital development, and high-quality support functions. Realizing the vision requires significant investment in system development and leveraging AI opportunities. Alongside operational efficiency, strong leadership and employee well-being will play a major role. We firmly believe Tornator has all the tools to move towards its new vision while fulfilling its mission: to generate sustainable well-being from forests. Impact of the War in Ukraine Russia’s war of aggression in Ukraine and the resulting general economic uncertainty have not had significant negative effects on Tornator’s earnings, balance sheet, or cash flows. Revenue and operating profit were at historically high levels during the reporting period. Operating cash flow was also strong. The company has not experienced increased credit losses, heightened financial risks, or asset devaluation. Contractors have found replacement labor for Ukrainian seasonal workers, so silviculture activities have not been compromised. Through our Romanian subsidiary, we have facilitated aid transports for Ukrainians affected by the war, and we will continue this support as long as needed. Key Events During the Reporting Period Timber deliveries were successful, totaling approximately 1.6 million cubic meters (1.5) and €95.5 million (€76.7). Investments in new production capacity by the forest industry, raw material needs in the energy sector, and reduced imports of timber increased demand and prices for renewable wood raw material. Thanks to strong customer cooperation, timber harvesting went smoothly, and silviculture services continued to grow. Revenue from silviculture services rose to €8.1 million (€6.6). Land sales generated €0.9 million in revenue for the Group (€1.9). Other income totaled €4.2 million (€3.3). The impact of changes in the fair value of interest instruments on profit was -€0.5 million (+€1.1) since the beginning of the year. At the end of June, the fair value of interest derivatives was €29.0 million positive (31 Dec 2024: +€29.5). The fair value of forests at the end of June was €3,664.3 million (31 Dec 2024: €3,594.9). Operating Environment In their June 2025 economic reviews, the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) and Pellervo Economic Research (PTT) estimated that the situation in the forest sector is improving moderately. Although global economic growth remains slow, easing inflation and falling interest rates support a recovery in demand. The outlook for the forest industry is cautiously positive, but no major growth leap is expected. According to forecasts, competition for raw wood in the domestic timber market will remain tight, keeping prices above long-term averages. Industrial wood harvesting in Finland totaled approximately 31.5 million cubic meters during January–June, slightly higher than the same period in 2024 (29.4 million m³). The removal of Russian imported wood from the market has clearly impacted wood price trends, and market prices have continued to rise. In the January–June average prices, the price of sawlogs was nearly 10% higher than the previous year, and the price of pulpwood was more than 10% higher than the previous year. Demand for holiday plots remained modest. In terms of forest estates, supply continued to be lower than demand, but the increase in price levels was moderate. In Estonia, the price level of wood declined slightly compared to the reference year. The forest estate market maintained a high price level. In Romania, the price level of wood remained at the same level as the reference year. The forest estate market was quiet. Finance The Group’s financial position remained strong, and cash flow from operations before financial items and taxes was EUR 42.0 million (EUR 34.8 million). The Group’s net financial expenses for January–June amounted to EUR -13.3 million (EUR -11.9 million). Tornator’s interest-bearing debt totaled EUR 1,043.6 million (31 Dec 2024: EUR 1,008.3 million), of which long-term debt was EUR 897.7 million (31 Dec 2024: EUR 946.8 million) and short-term debt EUR 145.9 million (31 Dec 2024: EUR 61.6 million). During the reporting period, the net cash from investing activities was EUR -60.9 million (EUR -21.3 million). Cash flow from financing activities was EUR -35.3 million (EUR -28.2 million). Liquid financial assets and cash as of 30 June 2025 amounted to EUR 14.0 million (31 Dec 2024: EUR 86.6 million). The company has a EUR 10 million bank account overdraft and a EUR 200 million committed revolving credit facility, which was fully available on the reporting date. Of Tornator’s EUR 300 million commercial paper program, EUR 97 million was in use on the reporting date. Outlook for Future Development Tornator expects its cash flow and debt servicing capacity to remain strong and stable throughout the remainder of the year. The annual update of the fair value of forests will be carried out in the fourth quarter. The performance of the forest industry and demand for wood are expected to remain positive. Market prices for wood are assumed to stay at current levels, at least in the short term. Silviculture activities in the company’s own forests will continue in line with a normal operating year, and the fertilization program will be implemented as planned. In addition, Tornator will carry out silviculture service work nationwide for Stora Enso’s silviculture service customers. The forest estate market is expected to remain similar to the reference year. Wind and solar power projects will be advanced where possible. In the long term, global megatrends such as climate change and population growth are expected to continue strengthening demand for sustainably produced renewable wood raw materials. However, temporary pressures on wood demand and harvesting may arise if, for example, international political tensions escalate. Weaker-than-expected global economic development could lead to reduced production in the forest industry and potentially negatively impact wood sales volumes and the company’s revenue.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1.

Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

We are the first defence and security industry company on the First North Growth Market marketplaces in Stockholm and Helsinki. The directed share issue arranged for the share exchange significantly strengthened the company's equity, and our financial position is strong. The amount of investments raised in connection with the corporate transactions was EUR 28.15 million. At the end of June, the company was net debt-free, and our equity ratio was 63.4%. Investments in new production facilities In line with our strategy, we have been able to quickly support the operations of our subsidiaries and secure financing and working capital for product development, internationalization and next-stage corporate transactions. After the merger, our subsidiary Uudenkaupungin Työvene acquired the property of Olkiluoto shipyard to increase its production capacity, and Lightspace Technologies announced an investment in its production facility in Ventspils, Latvia, to improve its cleanroom production capacity. In addition, our subsidiaries have several ongoing product development projects. The new production facilities of the Summa Drones business have been put into operation in Southern Finland, and the first test batch is being manufactured with our Ukrainian partner. We expect the first production batches to be completed and deliveries to begin during the second half of the year. Pro forma net sales increased by 35 per cent Several of our subsidiaries have already increased their net sales significantly compared to the previous year. In January–June 2025, our pro forma net sales were EUR 42.1 million, compared to EUR 31.1 million a year earlier. The net sales of our companies increased by more than 35 per cent in the first half of the year. Net sales in Summa Defence's continuing operations focusing on defence and security were EUR 34.9 (25.3) million and in the Renewable Energy business EUR 7.2 (5.8) million. Profitability improved During the first half of the year, our profitability also started to improve clearly, although the delay in the transaction slowed down the growth of the business volume of our subsidiaries. The profitability of our continuing operations was already slightly positive in the first half of the year, but Group administration expenses (EUR -1.9 million) and the result of the Renewable Energy business (EUR -1.9 million) pushed the pro forma adjusted operating profit to EUR -3.7 (-5.2) million. In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year.

We are the first defence and security industry company on the First North Growth Market marketplaces in Stockholm and Helsinki. The directed share issue arranged for the share exchange significantly strengthened the company's equity, and our financial position is strong. The amount of investments raised in connection with the corporate transactions was EUR 28.15 million. At the end of June, the company was net debt-free, and our equity ratio was 63.4%. Investments in new production facilities In line with our strategy, we have been able to quickly support the operations of our subsidiaries and secure financing and working capital for product development, internationalization and next-stage corporate transactions. After the merger, our subsidiary Uudenkaupungin Työvene acquired the property of Olkiluoto shipyard to increase its production capacity, and Lightspace Technologies announced an investment in its production facility in Ventspils, Latvia, to improve its cleanroom production capacity. In addition, our subsidiaries have several ongoing product development projects. The new production facilities of the Summa Drones business have been put into operation in Southern Finland, and the first test batch is being manufactured with our Ukrainian partner. We expect the first production batches to be completed and deliveries to begin during the second half of the year. Pro forma net sales increased by 35 per cent Several of our subsidiaries have already increased their net sales significantly compared to the previous year. In January–June 2025, our pro forma net sales were EUR 42.1 million, compared to EUR 31.1 million a year earlier. The net sales of our companies increased by more than 35 per cent in the first half of the year. Net sales in Summa Defence's continuing operations focusing on defence and security were EUR 34.9 (25.3) million and in the Renewable Energy business EUR 7.2 (5.8) million. Profitability improved During the first half of the year, our profitability also started to improve clearly, although the delay in the transaction slowed down the growth of the business volume of our subsidiaries. The profitability of our continuing operations was already slightly positive in the first half of the year, but Group administration expenses (EUR -1.9 million) and the result of the Renewable Energy business (EUR -1.9 million) pushed the pro forma adjusted operating profit to EUR -3.7 (-5.2) million. In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year.

We are the first defence and security industry company on the First North Growth Market marketplaces in Stockholm and Helsinki. The directed share issue arranged for the share exchange significantly strengthened the company's equity, and our financial position is strong. The amount of investments raised in connection with the corporate transactions was EUR 28.15 million. At the end of June, the company was net debt-free, and our equity ratio was 63.4%. Investments in new production facilities In line with our strategy, we have been able to quickly support the operations of our subsidiaries and secure financing and working capital for product development, internationalization and next-stage corporate transactions. After the merger, our subsidiary Uudenkaupungin Työvene acquired the property of Olkiluoto shipyard to increase its production capacity, and Lightspace Technologies announced an investment in its production facility in Ventspils, Latvia, to improve its cleanroom production capacity. In addition, our subsidiaries have several ongoing product development projects. The new production facilities of the Summa Drones business have been put into operation in Southern Finland, and the first test batch is being manufactured with our Ukrainian partner. We expect the first production batches to be completed and deliveries to begin during the second half of the year. Pro forma net sales increased by 35 per cent Several of our subsidiaries have already increased their net sales significantly compared to the previous year. In January–June 2025, our pro forma net sales were EUR 42.1 million, compared to EUR 31.1 million a year earlier. The net sales of our companies increased by more than 35 per cent in the first half of the year. Net sales in Summa Defence's continuing operations focusing on defence and security were EUR 34.9 (25.3) million and in the Renewable Energy business EUR 7.2 (5.8) million. Profitability improved During the first half of the year, our profitability also started to improve clearly, although the delay in the transaction slowed down the growth of the business volume of our subsidiaries. The profitability of our continuing operations was already slightly positive in the first half of the year, but Group administration expenses (EUR -1.9 million) and the result of the Renewable Energy business (EUR -1.9 million) pushed the pro forma adjusted operating profit to EUR -3.7 (-5.2) million. In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year.

Resignation of Chief Financial Officer On 15 April 2025, Fredrik Ideström announced his resignation as Chief Financial Officer. Appointment of Chief Financial Officer On 12 May 2025, Pierce Group AB (publ) announced the appointment of Fredrik Kjellgren as Chief Financial Officer. He is set to assume the role in the fourth quarter of 2025. Significant events after the end of the reporting period No significant events took place after the end of the reporting period. CEO comments Financial Performance Q2 was a strong quarter, marked by accelerating growth momentum that began in March (Q1) and continued throughout the second quarter. We are pleased to report our highest quarterly sales ever, with Q2 revenue growing by 15 percent (20 percent in local currency) compared to the same period last year - despite limited market tailwinds. As a result, Adjusted EBIT reached SEK 32 million, a significant improvement from SEK 17 million in Q2 2024 - also considering that we absorbed SEK 8 million in non-recurring transformation-related costs during the quarter. Growth was broad-based across all customer categories, primarily driven by improved stock availability of external brands compared to last year. External brands performed exceptionally well, while private brands growth was softer due to delayed product launches. That said, we executed major launches at the end of the quarter, and the initial customer response to our new private brand assortment has been promising. Operating expenses remain elevated as we expense all costs related to the implementation of our new tech stack, in accordance with accounting standards that do not allow capitalization of cloud-based systems. In Q2, this amounted to SEK 8 million, similar to Q1 (SEK 9 million), covering overlapping system licenses and external consultants. Our cash position remains strong at SEK 188 million, and inventory stood at SEK 522 million. Compared to last year, we have significantly invested in inventory breadth and depth. As communicated earlier, we will continue prioritizing product availability and short delivery lead times - core to our position as a leading industry specialist. Operations While comprehensive industry data is lacking, we are confident that we are taking market share. Our strategic focus on commercial fundamentals - the broadest and most attractive assortment, competitive (but not always the cheapest) pricing, and fast, reliable deliveries - is yielding results. This focus is helping us attract and retain more customers, accelerating on our journey towards our vision of undisputed market leadership. The improvements have translated into market share gains, a growing customer base, stronger retention, and a rising Net Promoter Score (NPS). In parallel, we are executing a major transformation of our IT landscape, replacing nearly all core systems. This is a critical step to overcome legacy tech debt and ensure long-term scalability and performance. In Q2, we successfully launched two of our four major platforms: our Customer Data Platform (CDP) and our new Product Information Management (PIM) system. These will enable us to increase personalization and product presentation which will improve the customer experience in an important way and thus further fuel growth. Operational efficiency measures also continued in Q2, including a reduction of approximately 13 white-collar FTEs across multiple functions. Since the start of our transformation, we have right-sized the company by reducing our white-collar workforce by over 30 percent - from 256 in Q2 2023 to 176 in Q2 2025 - while growing sales by 20 percent. Sales per white-collar FTE has thus increased by more than 70 percent. This was achieved by simplifying processes, reducing bureaucracy, and empowering teams to make decisions. While downsizing is never easy, I am proud of the productivity gains we’ve realized and extremely proud of the team. We’ve navigated significant change together, and their resilience has been remarkable. The simultaneous increase in our employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) reflects stronger alignment and engagement across the organization. Looking Ahead We are now preparing to launch our two largest systems: our new e-commerce platform and our new warehouse management system. These are complex, high-stakes deployments, and our teams are well-prepared. Rollouts will be phased over the coming quarters, with a pause during November and December to safeguard Black Friday and Christmas sales. We expect full deployment no later than Q2 2026. As previously communicated, transformation-related costs will continue through 2025, with some expected into early 2026. However, we anticipate a significant reduction starting in Q2 2026 as the new tech stack becomes fully operational. In parallel, our depreciation schedule is easing - several major assets will be fully depreciated by the end of 2025. Combined, the lower transformation costs and reduced depreciation are expected to improve EBIT by SEK 30-40 million on an annualized basis. With the launch of our new e-commerce platform, we will expand into 12 local markets currently served through our .eu site. These markets already contribute meaningfully to our growth. Together, they represent an accessible market twice the size of the Nordics, which today account for 30 percent of our sales. We believe locally adapted sites will further accelerate our performance in these countries. We are also seeing improvements in the mountain bike and scooter/moped verticals, which we currently serve to a limited extent. These categories represent a strong growth opportunity from 2026 and onward. The European e-commerce market for motorcycle gear and equipment is ripe for consolidation and the benefits of scale are clear. It’s not a question of if, but when and by whom this consolidation will be driven. Pierce is uniquely positioned with a pan-European platform should such consolidation come into play. We face a challenging and exciting period ahead, with major system launches that will unlock significant potential. I’m very pleased with where we are today and look forward to the autumn.

Looking Ahead We are now preparing to launch our two largest systems: our new e-commerce platform and our new warehouse management system. These are complex, high-stakes deployments, and our teams are well-prepared. Rollouts will be phased over the coming quarters, with a pause during November and December to safeguard Black Friday and Christmas sales. We expect full deployment no later than Q2 2026. As previously communicated, transformation-related costs will continue through 2025, with some expected into early 2026. However, we anticipate a significant reduction starting in Q2 2026 as the new tech stack becomes fully operational. In parallel, our depreciation schedule is easing - several major assets will be fully depreciated by the end of 2025. Combined, the lower transformation costs and reduced depreciation are expected to improve EBIT by SEK 30-40 million on an annualized basis. With the launch of our new e-commerce platform, we will expand into 12 local markets currently served through our .eu site. These markets already contribute meaningfully to our growth. Together, they represent an accessible market twice the size of the Nordics, which today account for 30 percent of our sales. We believe locally adapted sites will further accelerate our performance in these countries. We are also seeing improvements in the mountain bike and scooter/moped verticals, which we currently serve to a limited extent. These categories represent a strong growth opportunity from 2026 and onward. The European e-commerce market for motorcycle gear and equipment is ripe for consolidation and the benefits of scale are clear. It’s not a question of if, but when and by whom this consolidation will be driven. Pierce is uniquely positioned with a pan-European platform should such consolidation come into play. We face a challenging and exciting period ahead, with major system launches that will unlock significant potential. I’m very pleased with where we are today and look forward to the autumn.

Resignation of Chief Financial Officer On 15 April 2025, Fredrik Ideström announced his resignation as Chief Financial Officer. Appointment of Chief Financial Officer On 12 May 2025, Pierce Group AB (publ) announced the appointment of Fredrik Kjellgren as Chief Financial Officer. He is set to assume the role in the fourth quarter of 2025. Significant events after the end of the reporting period No significant events took place after the end of the reporting period. CEO comments Financial Performance Q2 was a strong quarter, marked by accelerating growth momentum that began in March (Q1) and continued throughout the second quarter. We are pleased to report our highest quarterly sales ever, with Q2 revenue growing by 15 percent (20 percent in local currency) compared to the same period last year - despite limited market tailwinds. As a result, Adjusted EBIT reached SEK 32 million, a significant improvement from SEK 17 million in Q2 2024 - also considering that we absorbed SEK 8 million in non-recurring transformation-related costs during the quarter. Growth was broad-based across all customer categories, primarily driven by improved stock availability of external brands compared to last year. External brands performed exceptionally well, while private brands growth was softer due to delayed product launches. That said, we executed major launches at the end of the quarter, and the initial customer response to our new private brand assortment has been promising. Operating expenses remain elevated as we expense all costs related to the implementation of our new tech stack, in accordance with accounting standards that do not allow capitalization of cloud-based systems. In Q2, this amounted to SEK 8 million, similar to Q1 (SEK 9 million), covering overlapping system licenses and external consultants. Our cash position remains strong at SEK 188 million, and inventory stood at SEK 522 million. Compared to last year, we have significantly invested in inventory breadth and depth. As communicated earlier, we will continue prioritizing product availability and short delivery lead times - core to our position as a leading industry specialist. Operations While comprehensive industry data is lacking, we are confident that we are taking market share. Our strategic focus on commercial fundamentals - the broadest and most attractive assortment, competitive (but not always the cheapest) pricing, and fast, reliable deliveries - is yielding results. This focus is helping us attract and retain more customers, accelerating on our journey towards our vision of undisputed market leadership. The improvements have translated into market share gains, a growing customer base, stronger retention, and a rising Net Promoter Score (NPS). In parallel, we are executing a major transformation of our IT landscape, replacing nearly all core systems. This is a critical step to overcome legacy tech debt and ensure long-term scalability and performance. In Q2, we successfully launched two of our four major platforms: our Customer Data Platform (CDP) and our new Product Information Management (PIM) system. These will enable us to increase personalization and product presentation which will improve the customer experience in an important way and thus further fuel growth. Operational efficiency measures also continued in Q2, including a reduction of approximately 13 white-collar FTEs across multiple functions. Since the start of our transformation, we have right-sized the company by reducing our white-collar workforce by over 30 percent - from 256 in Q2 2023 to 176 in Q2 2025 - while growing sales by 20 percent. Sales per white-collar FTE has thus increased by more than 70 percent. This was achieved by simplifying processes, reducing bureaucracy, and empowering teams to make decisions. While downsizing is never easy, I am proud of the productivity gains we’ve realized and extremely proud of the team. We’ve navigated significant change together, and their resilience has been remarkable.

Since the start of our transformation, we have right-sized the company by reducing our white-collar workforce by over 30 percent - from 256 in Q2 2023 to 176 in Q2 2025 - while growing sales by 20 percent. Sales per white-collar FTE has thus increased by more than 70 percent. This was achieved by simplifying processes, reducing bureaucracy, and empowering teams to make decisions. While downsizing is never easy, I am proud of the productivity gains we’ve realized and extremely proud of the team. We’ve navigated significant change together, and their resilience has been remarkable. The simultaneous increase in our employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) reflects stronger alignment and engagement across the organization. Looking Ahead We are now preparing to launch our two largest systems: our new e-commerce platform and our new warehouse management system. These are complex, high-stakes deployments, and our teams are well-prepared. Rollouts will be phased over the coming quarters, with a pause during November and December to safeguard Black Friday and Christmas sales. We expect full deployment no later than Q2 2026. As previously communicated, transformation-related costs will continue through 2025, with some expected into early 2026. However, we anticipate a significant reduction starting in Q2 2026 as the new tech stack becomes fully operational. In parallel, our depreciation schedule is easing - several major assets will be fully depreciated by the end of 2025. Combined, the lower transformation costs and reduced depreciation are expected to improve EBIT by SEK 30-40 million on an annualized basis. With the launch of our new e-commerce platform, we will expand into 12 local markets currently served through our .eu site. These markets already contribute meaningfully to our growth. Together, they represent an accessible market twice the size of the Nordics, which today account for 30 percent of our sales. We believe locally adapted sites will further accelerate our performance in these countries. We are also seeing improvements in the mountain bike and scooter/moped verticals, which we currently serve to a limited extent. These categories represent a strong growth opportunity from 2026 and onward. The European e-commerce market for motorcycle gear and equipment is ripe for consolidation and the benefits of scale are clear. It’s not a question of if, but when and by whom this consolidation will be driven. Pierce is uniquely positioned with a pan-European platform should such consolidation come into play. We face a challenging and exciting period ahead, with major system launches that will unlock significant potential. I’m very pleased with where we are today and look forward to the autumn.

Resignation of Chief Financial Officer On 15 April 2025, Fredrik Ideström announced his resignation as Chief Financial Officer. Appointment of Chief Financial Officer On 12 May 2025, Pierce Group AB (publ) announced the appointment of Fredrik Kjellgren as Chief Financial Officer. He is set to assume the role in the fourth quarter of 2025. Significant events after the end of the reporting period No significant events took place after the end of the reporting period. CEO comments Financial Performance Q2 was a strong quarter, marked by accelerating growth momentum that began in March (Q1) and continued throughout the second quarter. We are pleased to report our highest quarterly sales ever, with Q2 revenue growing by 15 percent (20 percent in local currency) compared to the same period last year - despite limited market tailwinds. As a result, Adjusted EBIT reached SEK 32 million, a significant improvement from SEK 17 million in Q2 2024 - also considering that we absorbed SEK 8 million in non-recurring transformation-related costs during the quarter. Growth was broad-based across all customer categories, primarily driven by improved stock availability of external brands compared to last year. External brands performed exceptionally well, while private brands growth was softer due to delayed product launches. That said, we executed major launches at the end of the quarter, and the initial customer response to our new private brand assortment has been promising. Operating expenses remain elevated as we expense all costs related to the implementation of our new tech stack, in accordance with accounting standards that do not allow capitalization of cloud-based systems. In Q2, this amounted to SEK 8 million, similar to Q1 (SEK 9 million), covering overlapping system licenses and external consultants. Our cash position remains strong at SEK 188 million, and inventory stood at SEK 522 million. Compared to last year, we have significantly invested in inventory breadth and depth. As communicated earlier, we will continue prioritizing product availability and short delivery lead times - core to our position as a leading industry specialist. Operations While comprehensive industry data is lacking, we are confident that we are taking market share. Our strategic focus on commercial fundamentals - the broadest and most attractive assortment, competitive (but not always the cheapest) pricing, and fast, reliable deliveries - is yielding results. This focus is helping us attract and retain more customers, accelerating on our journey towards our vision of undisputed market leadership. The improvements have translated into market share gains, a growing customer base, stronger retention, and a rising Net Promoter Score (NPS). In parallel, we are executing a major transformation of our IT landscape, replacing nearly all core systems. This is a critical step to overcome legacy tech debt and ensure long-term scalability and performance. In Q2, we successfully launched two of our four major platforms: our Customer Data Platform (CDP) and our new Product Information Management (PIM) system. These will enable us to increase personalization and product presentation which will improve the customer experience in an important way and thus further fuel growth. Operational efficiency measures also continued in Q2, including a reduction of approximately 13 white-collar FTEs across multiple functions. Since the start of our transformation, we have right-sized the company by reducing our white-collar workforce by over 30 percent - from 256 in Q2 2023 to 176 in Q2 2025 - while growing sales by 20 percent.

This was driven by continued growth in Endoscopy Solutions, which grew 15.9%, and solid performance in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, which grew 6.4%. This brings the organic growth for the first nine months to 14.3% and the EBIT margin to 13.9%. The financial guidance for organic revenue growth for 2024/25 is updated to reflect the continued solid growth and is now expected to be 12-14% (previously 11-14%). “I am pleased with the continued solid growth momentum in our third quarter. With 15.9% growth in Endoscopy Solutions and portfolio expansions in pulmonology and urology, we are deepening our presence in high-growth markets. On the back of solid revenue performance in Endoscopy Solutions and strong growth in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, we are raising the lower end of our organic revenue guidance to 12-14% for the full year. We maintain our EBIT margin guidance, supported by solid organic growth and operational leverage, even as we navigate FX and tariff-related dynamics. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and execution, which makes this continued progress possible. We look forward to welcoming institutional investors, analysts, and financial media to attend our Capital Markets Day on 1 October 2025, where we will share insights on strategy and market opportunities.” BRITT MEELBY JENSEN Chief Executive Officer Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Business highlights Advancing pulmonology market leadership position with the expansion of Ambu® SureSight™ Connect video laryngoscopy solution for pediatric patients. Strengthened urology offering with FDA clearance for Ambu® aScope™ 5 Cysto HD cysto-nephroscope for PCNL procedures. Continued sustainability leadership with launch of first-of-its-kind endoscope tack-back and recycling program, the Ambu® Recircle Program, in key markets. Scott Heinzelman appointed new President for North America and member of Ambu’s Executive Leadership Team, as of 25 August. Financial highlights Revenue increased organically by 12.0% (15.0%) to DKK 1,507m (DKK 1,383m), with reported growth of 9.0% (15.7%). Organic growth for the first nine months was 14.3% (14.9%), with reported growth of 14.2% (12.9%). Endoscopy Solutions increased organically by 15.9% (18.0%). The Pulmonology business group posted 11.2% (9.9%) organic growth, positively impacted by continued aScope™ 5 Broncho adoption, as well as the newly launched video laryngoscopy solution. The Urology, ENT, & GI business group posted 20.8% (27.6%) organic growth, mainly driven by the aScope™ 4 portfolio, with sustained strong growth momentum for aScope™ 5 Uretero. Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring increased organically by 6.4% (10.9%) and by 11.1% (6.4%) for the first nine months, driven by both volume and price increases. EBIT before special items (b.s.i.) was DKK 170m (DKK 178m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 11.3% (12.9%). EBIT b.s.i. for the first nine months ended at DKK 637m (DKK 498m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 13.9% (12.4%). EBIT margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs but positively impacted by continued operational leverage from solid organic growth. Free cash flow (FCF) before acquisitions totaled DKK 128m (DKK 163m), leaving FCF for the first nine months to DKK 277m. This was impacted by continued higher net working capital to mitigate the global geopolitical uncertainties and support growth, and profitability was impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs. As a result, FCF assumptions for FY 2024/25 are now DKK ~400m (previously DKK +500m). Raise of lower end of organic revenue guidance to 12-14% (previously 11-14%), driven by continued procedure growth and conversion towards single-use solutions. EBIT margin b.s.i. guidance is maintained, with investments continuing as planned to support long-term growth, despite FX headwind and increased tariff costs. 2024/25 financial guidance: Organic revenue growth : 12-14% (previously 11-14%) EBIT margin b.s.i. : 13-15% Q3 2024/25 conference call A conference call is broadcast live today, 22 August 2025 at 11:00 (CEST), via ambu.com/webcastQ32025 .

The second quarter marked my first period as CEO of Albert, during which we both presented and executed a comprehensive transformation programme to simplify the organisation, reduce costs, and strengthen financial flexibility. These decisive measures were essential to place Albert firmly on the path towards our previously communicated financial targets. Solid subscription growth despite topline pressure Net revenue in Q2 declined by 16% year-on-year to 41.6m SEK, mainly due to a drop of more than 50% in B2B sales of physical, non-subscription products, particularly in North America. Political and economic uncertainty in the region has extended decision cycles for institutional buyers, delaying orders. Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew 6% year-on-year to 139.5m SEK, driven by continued expansion in our B2C subscription business. Strong customer acquisition and retention underline the resilience and scalability of our model, even during periods of softer transactional B2B sales. Restructuring to restore profitability In response to the current market environment, we reduced our global headcount from 103 to approximately 75 employees. This restructuring, which generated one-off costs of 5.3m SEK in Q2, impacted EBITDA which ended at -10.5m SEK. Adjusted for these one-off items, EBITDA improved sequentially to -5.1m SEK from -6.7m SEK in Q1. The full effect of the cost reductions will be visible from Q3 2025 and onwards. Tight focus on liquidity, portfolio optimisation and cost discipline Cash flow from operating activities in Q2 was -17.5m SEK, with a total cash outflow of -21.2m SEK including investing and financing activities. We closed the quarter with 34m SEK in cash and equivalents, compared to 55m SEK at the end of Q1. Following the restructuring, we expect a substantial reduction in our monthly burn rate, which together with our current cash position provides a stable platform to execute our plan of reaching positive EBITDA in 2025 and cash-flow break-even in 2026. Strategic priorities going forward Our immediate focus is on initiatives with direct EBITDA impact. We will continue to strengthen B2C performance in the Nordics, where unit economics remain attractive, while selectively rebuilding B2B momentum in target markets. In the UK, we are expanding our offering, including a recent launch in Wales. As part of the ongoing strategic review, we are assessing our product and brand portfolio to ensure every asset supports our core growth priorities and profitability goals. All future investments will be prioritised based on maximised ROI and strategic fit. Albert’s strength lies in our mission, our products, and our people. With a leaner organisation, sharper priorities, and disciplined execution, Albert is now positioned to translate its strengths into sustainable, profitable growth. Gothenburg, August 2025 Fredrik Bengtsson, CEO — 1 April to 30 June Annual recurring revenue (ARR) from subscriptions was 139,453k (130,995k) SEK, which is an increase of 6% compared to the previous year.

As part of the restructuring, the Group has reduced its workforce from 103 to approximately 75 employees. All associated costs were recognised in Q2. This will have a positive impact on EBITDA and Cash from Q3 2025 and onwards, but will slow down some product development. During the period Jonas Mårtensson left his position as CEO. Fredrik Bengtsson was appointed Interim CEO for the Group as of April 22. Significant events after the end of the period During the reporting period, the Group’s CFO Katarina Strivall left her position. Katarina’s last working day was on June 30. As of July 1, Erik Bergelin has assumed the role of CFO for the Group.

GROUP’S KEY FIGURES 1–6/2025 1–6/2024 1–12/2024 Net sales, EUR million 16.7 14.5 36.7 Operating profit/loss, EUR million -2.8 -2.7 -2.4 Profit/loss before taxes, EUR million -2.9 -3.3 -2.6 Average number of employees 158 167 157 Average number of employees in person-years 155 159 153 Earnings per share, EUR -0.39 -0.46 -0.37 Equity ratio, % 52.3 55.7 59.7 Return on equity, % -18.6 -18.2 -14.3 Equity per share, EUR 1.93 2.23 2.32 Gearing ratio, % -7.4 -24.6 -3.5 Honkarakenne Oyj’s CEO Marko Saarelainen commented on the half-year report as follows: “As the review period began, the outlook for Finland's housing and construction industry was very challenging. The order intake for the first quarter declined slightly compared to last year. In early summer, the order intake developed positively, and the order book for the review period rose to EUR 26.2 million, an 18% increase from the end of last year. Despite increased net sales and efficiency measures, the operating profit landed in the red at EUR -2.8 million. Profit before tax improved EUR 0.4 million compared to last year but remained loss-making at EUR -2.9 million. Profitability was impacted by the sales mix being weighted towards domestic sales, as the export being lower than in the comparison period. Despite of cost reductions, fixed costs remained too high relative to net sales. This was partly influenced by development projects planned to support future growth and their implementation despite the challenging market conditions. In the domestic B2C business, consumer caution in decision-making was reflected in the order intake for the first half of the year. The domestic B2C business was able to increase net sales compared to last year, but profitability faced challenges. Overall the domestic business result was a hard-won victory in a challenging market, but looking ahead, the business requires efficiency measures to improve profitability. The project business achieved significant percentage growth, but the volume is still quite small. The B2B business began to be actively developed early in the year, both domestically and in exports. The B2B project pipeline is growing, and the outlook in this regard is cautiously positive. In the export business, order intake from Asia fell short of the comparison period. Uncertainties regarding Japanese regulatory requirements have slowed down business during the review period. The situation regarding Japan is likely to continue similarly in the latter half of the year. Order intake in the APAC region remained at the previous year's level, but no net sales were yet recognized during H1. Construction of the first phase of the India project progressed after the review period to a launch event held in July, where guests were able to hear about Honkarakenne's products, get acquainted with completed buildings, and the overall plan for the area development project. The European market area was slightly below the comparison year's order intake, excluding Germany, where orders received and net sales accumulated for the period were growing. Due to the development efforts of the German team, the company expects positive growth in order intake and net sales for consumer and project customers. The outlook for the rest of Europe remains partly challenging. Preparations for the production start of the new non-settling log, launched in May, were made during the first half of the year. After the review period, production of the new non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, started and the first deliveries to customers were made in early August. In the challenging geopolitical situation and Finland's historically weak construction industry cycle, I believe the company's resources, such as its strong market position, robust balance sheet, good financial standing, skilled personnel, and excellent product and collection, will provide Honka with a significant competitive advantage compared to its competitors."" NET SALES Honkarakenne Group’s net sales for the first half of 2025 increased by 15% to EUR 16.7 million (14.5). Honkarakenne presents its set sales data divided in two parts: Finland and Exports. Below we present the net sales based on this division for the first half of 2025 and the second half of 2024 with the comparison year. Geographical distribution of net sales: NET SALES DEVELOPMENT Net sales distribution, % 1–6/2025 1–6/2024 1-12/2024 Finland 80% 73% 71% Exports 20% 27% 29% Total 100 % 100% 100% Net sales, MEUR 1-6/2025 1-6/2024 Change 7-12/2024 1–12/2024 Finland 13.4 10.6 27% 15.6 26.2 Exports 3.3 3.9 -16% 6.6 10.5 Total 16.7 14.5 15% 22.2 36.7 Finland also includes billet sales and the sale of process by-products for recycling. Exports include all other countries except Finland. ORDER BOOK Group’s order book was 3% lower than in the comparison year and amounted to EUR 26.0 million (27.0). The order book increased by +18% from EUR 22.2 million at the end of December last year. This was driven by higher sales in both the domestic consumer business and the project and export business compared to the first and especially the last half of last year. Order book refers to orders with a delivery date within the next 24 months. Some orders may have a financing or building permit condition. TRENDS IN PROFIT AND PFOFITABILITY Operating profit for the review period stood at EUR -2.8 million (-2.7) and the profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). The lower profitability compared to comparison period was impacted by the sales mix being weighted towards domestic business, as the share of exports remained below the comparison period. Some domestic deliveries included winter seasons installation campaigns carried out late last year, which had lower profitability than normally. In addition, fixed costs during the review period were higher than in the comparison period, even though there were cost reductions in operations and temporary layoffs. FINANCING AND INVESTMENT At the end of the review period, Honkarakenne’s financial position was good. The Group’s equity ratio was 52.3% (55.7%) and net gearing ratio was -7.4% (-24.6%). The Group’s net financial liabilities amounted to EUR -0.8 million (-3.2), so the Group’s liquid assets exceeded its financial liabilities. The Group’s liquid assets totalled EUR 5.0 million (6.9). The Group also has a EUR 3.0 (3.0) overdraft facility, which has not been used in the review period or the comparison period. The Group’s gross investments amounted to EUR 0.7 million (0.7), excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with the IFRS 16 standard. Investments during the period mainly related to the replacement investment in the non-settling logs production line at the Karstula mill. PRODUCTS AND MARKET AREAS Honka's collection is being renewed and developed in a market-specific and customer-centric manner, and the design of the collections strongly focuses on the quality of living and the sustainability of buildings. Honka's convertible models are designed to enable a wide range of lifestyle variations, eliminating the need to build or buy new homes when life situations change, and ensuring there is no need to give up a natural, sustainable log house with healthy indoor air quality. In May, the company launched a new fourth-generation non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, whose wider-than-before vertical middle lamella increases the stability of log walls, enabling the construction of even larger projects such as apartment buildings and schools. In addition, the new log features an advanced design profile and a minimal seam groove between the logs, facilitating an easier implementation of modern architecture and various interior styles, as well as the combination of the log with other building materials such as glass, stone and steel. In connection with the launch, interior design concepts supporting the design of interior decoration for Honka log homes and holiday homes, along with the related HonkaLook Book brochure, were published. During the review period, the development of cost-effective leisure home and detached house models for the Finnish and Nordic markets continued, and new collection brochures for the Finnish market were released. In addition, larger-scale Honka Grand Design house models, featuring international architecture, were unveiled, specifically aimed at the company's international markets. Additionally, in the spring, the Pineo accommodation concept, targeted at international and domestic tourism and accommodation businesses, was launched, complete with buildings of various sizes. After the review period, Honka was an exhibitor at the Oulu Housing Fair in Honka Kömmeli, which received great interest. The show home is an architect-designed, individually tailored log house for a young couple building their first home, which features a traditional Finnish loft sauna. The log building represents a modern interpretation of the traditional architecture of the coastal region and the classic red ochre colour. Honka’s operations are certified with the ISO 9001 quality standard and the ISO 14001 environmental standard. In Finland , net sales were 27% higher than in the same period last year at EUR 13.4 million (10.6). The net sales growth resulted from a slightly higher order intake in the project and consumer businesses from the previous year, as well as sales from the beginning of the year that were delivered during the review period. During the review period, domestic orders received were lower than in the comparison period for the consumer business and the project business. The domestic operating environment is still awaiting a more meaningful recovery in terms of construction and new delivery agreements. Demand and order backlog are showing moderate growth. Final decisions on construction starts are delayed or further postponed in the uncertain economic situation. The company expects domestic demand to pick up and turn more favourable, also regarding construction starts. For the remainder of the year, new orders are estimated to reach the previous year's level or slightly higher, particularly in the project business and leisure homes. In exports , net sales were 16% lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year at EUR 3.3 million (3.9). The decline in revenue during the review period was primarily due to the varying delivery schedules of projects under delivery. These were individual deliveries of detached houses and holiday homes mainly to sites located in the Asian and European regions. Received orders were at the comparison period's level, and regional variations across different export countries are significant. In the European region, demand has finally picked up, leading to larger orders as well. Demand and orders received from the Asian region have remained stable. Exports are seeing increased demand and prospects, particularly for various-sized projects. These involve uncertainty regarding the timeframe within which demand could materialize and lead to new orders. Uncertainty regarding the operating environment outlook may weaken and curb increased demand and expected export growth. STRATEGY 2025-2028 The company specified the objectives of its strategy extending to the end of 2024 to better reflect the changes in the operating environment. Through the strategy, Honkarakenne's position as Finland's largest exporter of wooden buildings will be strengthened. With the export and customer experience strategy, the Group aims for controlled growth in net sales during the strategy period, with the focus on profitability. The performance targets are based on process efficiency, conceptualization, and management, which also improve customer and employee experience. Honkarakenne Group's vision is to offer truly the best living. The Group’s mission is to improve the quality of people’s lives and housing. Honkarakenne’s strategic objectives for the 2025–2028 period are: Strengthening customer experience Effectiveness in everything Renewable Honka spirit Managed international operations To implement the strategy, development projects and focus areas supporting the strategy's progress are refined within the Group's extended management team, in accordance with the Objectives and key results model. Honkarakenne states that it does not consider long-term targets as market guidance for any particular year of the strategy period. SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability is a key part of Honkarakenne’s strategy. Honkarakenne Group is continuously developing its production, services and selection to enable healthier, more ecological and better-quality living. Group focuses on building the future and choices are guided by human and natural vitality. Honkarakenne’s sustainability programme, `We are building the future’, is based on the changes we have identified in our operating environment, our ethical principles, recognised expectations of our staff and other stakeholders, and understanding the customer in our markets. As part of Honkarakenne's sustainability programme, the parent company uses 100% electricity produced with renewable energy and certified with a guarantee of origin with carbon dioxide emissions of 0 g/kWh at all its own sites. Honkarakenne also promotes sustainability through its various product solutions. In conjunction with the Rock and Star collection, which was launched during the period, Honka Säästö introduced a solution for safely shutting off both water and heat in living spaces. The solution allows the cottage to be kept unheated in the living areas during the winter season without the risk of freezing water pipes or damaging appliances. Logs as a breathable structure enable sustainable construction and, with the Honka Säästö solution, also electricity savings. THE HONKA BRAND The core of the Honka brand is the close relationship with nature and Finnish happiness. Honka's yellow is the colour of hope and joy. Honka helps every customer realize the dreams that are important to them and Honka has the honour to convey the vitality of the northern forests. SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS Honkarakenne operates in a business that is seasonal by nature. Especially in Finland, construction mostly takes place during summer, so there are more deliveries in summer and autumn than during the winter. Considering the existing market and demand conditions, the company aims to even out this seasonality especially with export activities. During the review period, the company's market situation was challenging in all its areas. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Group’s R&D costs in January-June were EUR 0.2 million (0.3), which was 1.0% (1.8%) of net sales. During the review period, a new fourth-generation non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, was developed, featuring a vertical middle lamella that is wider than before, increasing the stability of log walls and enabling the construction of increasingly larger buildings such as apartment buildings and schools. The new log was launched on the market in the spring and will go into production in early autumn. Honka’s interior design concepts and related new product solutions were developed. New concepts and products, including interior panels, were launched in the spring. During the review period, product solutions for larger buildings continued to be developed, including for the needs of the Honka MultiStorey™ building concept. In addition, the development of the Honka Healthy House™ concept was continued, and the concept was introduced to international markets early in the year. The aim of development projects is to increase the use of wood in construction to promote climate targets. Wood is renewable raw material and wood construction is part of sustainable use of forests. The Group has not capitalized development costs during the review period. PERSONNEL The Group’s average number of personnel, measured in person-years, totalled 155 (159) persons during the first half of the year. The decrease from the comparison period was 4 people. The Group’s average number of personnel, measured by employment relationships was 158 (167) during the first half of the year. During both the review period and the comparison period, the parent company's personnel were laid off varying periods due to low demand, low production and delivery volumes, as well as during a production stoppage, when the installation of a new non-settling log line was carried out. In March 2024, the Board of Directors of the parent company decided, on a share-based incentive program for senior management for the years 2024–2026. The purpose of the plan is to align key employees with the company's objectives and to incentivise the creation of shareholder value. The Performance-Based Share Plan 2024–2026 has a three-year vesting period and the metrics for the period are net sales and operating profit margin. Five people participate in the 2024–2026 incentive program, and the rewards correspond to a maximum of 75,000 shares in total. There were no expenses related to the incentive scheme during the reporting period. In March, a joint staff day was held at the Karstula factory for personnel and domestic representatives. In addition to spending time together, they were able to familiarize themselves with the production line for the new non-settling log, which was completed earlier this year, and learn about its operations. EXECUTIVE GROUP During the review period the Executive Group consisted of: Marko Saarelainen, CEO; Eino Hekali, Vice President, Product; Maarit Jylhä, CFO; Petri Perttula, Business Vice President, Operations Global B2B; and Juhani Saukko, Business Vice President, Operations Finland B2C.

SHARES, SHARE CAPITAL AND OWN SHARES During the review period, Honkarakenne Oyj’s shares numbered 6,211,419, of which 300,096 were class A shares and 5,911,323 class B shares. The company’s share capital has not changed, remaining at EUR 9,897,936.00. Each class B share entitles to one (1) vote and a class A share to twenty (20) votes, bringing to total number of votes conferred by the shares during the review period to 11,913,243. Honkarakenne’s class B shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd’s Small Cap list with the ticker HONBS. The highest price of the listed class B share was EUR 3.05, and the lowest price was EUR 2.37. The closing price at the balance sheet date was EUR 2.76. The market capitalisation of the stock at the end of the financial year was EUR 16.3 million. The traded class B shares was EUR 0.7 million and the trading volume was 0.3 million shares. Honkarakenne has not acquired its own shares during the review period. At the end of the report period, the parent company held 321,052 of its own Series B shares with a total purchase price of EUR 1,186,556.34. Own shares account for 5.17% of all Honkarakenne shares and 2.69% of all votes. The acquisition cost of own shares reduces the free equity of both the parent company and the Group. FLAGGING NOTIFICATIONS No flagging notifications were received during the review period. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Honkarakenne Oyj complied with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies issued by the Securities Market Association in 2025. For more information about corporate governance, go to SHORT-TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The main risks and uncertainties of Honkarakenne relate to negative changes in the operating environment of the company and its customers, increased costs of raw materials and components, their availability and the functioning of the overall supply chains. If demand falls sharply in the operating environment and costs remain high, it may have significant effects on the company’s earnings development. The economic uncertainty in the Group’s operating environment is negatively reflected in business and consumer confidence. Economic risks continue to be driven by consumer confidence and employment concerns, inflation, interest rates and access to financing. The uncertainty of the military aggression initiated by Russia and all its effects on business are difficult to assess. Replacing the order book lost in the Russian and Ukrainian market area with other export markets may be prolonged or uncertain in the current global market situation. If the war is further prolonged or escalates, or if the instability in the Middle East would spread more widely, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and results of operations. The valuation of items in the balance sheet is based on the management’s current estimates. Any changes to these estimates may affect the company’s financial performance. REPORTING This report contains statements that relate to the future, and these statements are based on hypotheses that the company's management hold currently, and on the decisions and plans that are currently in place. Although the management believes that the hypotheses relating to the future are well-founded, there is no guarantee that the said hypotheses will prove to be correct. The half-year report has not been audited and the figures are unaudited. Figures in brackets refer to the corresponding period one year earlier, unless otherwise stated. Honkarakenne complies with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). An APM is a financial measure of performance other than a financial measure defined or specified in IFRS. Therefore, instead of the previous term ‘without non-recurring items’, the term ‘adjusted’ is used. The company classifies significant business transactions that are considered to affect comparisons between different reporting periods as adjustment items. Such transactions include significant reorganisation expenses, significant impairment losses or reversals thereof, significant capital gains and losses on assets, and other significant non-customary income or expenses. This half-year report bulletin has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. The half-year report bulletin should be read together with the 2024 financial statements. The accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are the same as in the financial statements for 2024, with the exception of standards and interpretations that have come into force on January 1 2025 or thereafter. The impact of the new standards and interpretations is described later in the section “New standards and interpretations”. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD There are no significant events. OUTLOOK FOR 2025 (published on 12 February 2025) According to Honkarakenne’s view, the Group’s net sales in 2025 will be slightly higher than in the previous guidance and amount to EUR 38-45 million. The Group’s operating profit is EUR -2.6 – -0.0 million. BASIS FOR THE OUTLOOK The company's outlook for the 2025 development is based on the existing order book, the expectation of challenges in the operating environment and on market development. Uncertainty about the development of the economic situation in Finland, interest rates and availability of financing may negatively affect demand from consumer and professional builders and their decision-making concerning construction, thus creating uncertainty in the starts of new construction projects. The company sees that strategic focus on export markets holds potential and supports profitable growth.

Operating result was EUR -0.8 (-0.1) million. EBITDA was EUR 1.0 (1.5) million. The net sales of Food Solutions were EUR 17.3 (16.5) million and operating result EUR -0.4 (-0.1) million. The net sales of Oilseed Products were EUR 22.1 (20.7) million and operating result EUR 0.2 (0.7) million. Net sales grew from the comparison period. In Food Solutions, both net sales and sales volumes increased slightly from the comparison period, particularly following growth in retail sales. Operating result weakened in both businesses. In Oilseed Products, the decline in profit was particularly attributable to the price of the raw material used and the unfavourable breakdown of sales between different product groups. In both businesses, profit performance was weakened by prolonged collective bargaining negotiations between the Finnish Food and Drink Industries Federation and the Finnish Food Workers’ Union. Overtime and shift change bans as well as strike days affecting Food Solutions were reflected in challenges in delivery reliability during the second quarter. January–June 2025 Net sales were EUR 83.0 (79.2) million. Operating result was EUR 1.5 (3.3) million. EBITDA was EUR 5.1 (6.5) million. The net sales of Food Solutions were EUR 37.6 (37.0) million and operating result EUR 2.1 (1.8) million. The net sales of Oilseed Products were EUR 45.7 (42.5) million and operating result EUR 0.7 (2.9) million. The Group’s liquidity was good, and its financial position was strong. The equity ratio was 83.4 (82.5) per cent and gearing was -1.1 (-6.2) per cent. The Group’s cash flow from operating activities after interest and taxes was EUR 13.1 (6.8) million. Apetit’s reporting segments are Food Solutions and Oilseed Products. In addition to the reporting segments, Apetit reports Group Functions, consisting of the expenses related to Group management and strategic projects, that are not allocated to the business segments. The information in this report is unaudited. The figures in brackets refer to the corresponding period in 2024, and the comparison period means the corresponding period in the previous year, unless otherwise stated. PROFIT GUIDANCE FOR 2025 UNCHANGED (published on 13 February 2025) Group’s operating result is estimated to slightly decrease from the comparison year (EUR 9.3 million in 2024).

The prolonged collective bargaining negotiations between the Finnish Food and Drink Industries' Federation and the Finnish Food Workers’ Union caused challenges to both of Apetit's businesses during the first two quarters of the year. The overtime and shift change bans during the negotiations affected delivery reliability in both businesses. The strike days related to the negotiations also affected operations in Food Solutions. Food Solutions improved its result in the first half of the year. Both sales volumes and net sales have increased slightly year-on-year. In Oilseed Products, the decline in result was attributable not only to the price of the raw material used, but also to the decrease in sales of refined oil and challenges in delivery reliability. Apetit’s operating result in the second quarter declined from the comparison period. The delivery reliability situation normalised in both businesses in June. Net sales increased in both businesses in the second quarter year-on-year. In Food Solutions, also sales volumes increased. Retail sales developed positively due to the cool early summer being favourable to the sale of frozen products. In July, we announced an investment of approximately EUR 2 million in the Kantvik vegetable oil milling plant. The strategic investment improves the production process of the raw material for the BlackGrain from Yellow Fields® rapeseed powder. The investment in late 2025 will strongly support the commercialisation of BlackGrain. The investment will multiply BlackGrain’s raw material production capacity and significantly improve the quality and efficiency of the process. The total investment includes replacement investments in the milling plant’s current processes. The availability of raw materials has been one of the bottlenecks for increasing actual production. We will continue the practical development of BlackGrain’s various product applications. Thanks to its versatility, BlackGrain is suitable for a wide range of products in the food industry. Customer-oriented product application work is carried out for both BlackGrain rapeseed powder and TVP plant protein made from BlackGrain, which contains pea protein in addition to BlackGrain. At the same time, we are investigating alternatives for producing the BlackGrain rapeseed powder. Apetit is assessing potential partnerships and starting production by making an investment in the Kantvik vegetable oil milling plant or with purchased services. The strategically important ERP project has progressed according to schedule. The new ERP system is scheduled to be implemented in Oilseed Products by the end of the year, after which all Group operations will be covered by the new system. The outlook for the harvest season is currently moderate. In early summer, even the cool weather offered a promising start to the growing season, which benefitted spinach and pea in particular. However, the hottest period in the history of measurements in July weakened the harvest for frozen peas due to the rapid ripening of the harvest. Regional heavy rains taxed frozen pea crops in some places. Frozen peas are harvested on a record-large area of 2,000 hectares. The success of the harvest season is ultimately determined by the weather in the autumn and the harvesting conditions. The growing season of onion, which is Apetit’s contract farming crop for the first time, has largely gone according to expectations. Onion is a significant crop in Apetit’s product range and a strategic addition to the list of contract farming crops. The cultivation areas for Finnish oilseed plants grew strongly from the previous year. The growth season of spring-sown oilseed plants has largely progressed according to expectations and the harvest outlook is at an average level. There are regional differences in weather conditions and pest situation. The weather conditions early in the growing season were favourable for autumn oilseed plants, so oilseed plant fields shone exceptionally yellow in the early summer. The harvest outlook for autumn oilseed plants is good. We will continue to invest in Finnish cultivation development. Several variety trials are underway in the RypsiRapsi forum. Trials are underway in autumn oilseed plants with regard to sowing technology, among other things, and fertiliser and sowing method trials are underway in spring oilseed plants, both on a square and farm scale. The Räpi experimental farm, on the other hand, is running two projects related to different new plant protection methods. Development projects in Finnish cultivation lay down the conditions for the continuum of cultivation of plants significant to Apetit, especially in adapting to the changes brought about by climate change. The new national nutrition recommendations published in late 2024 and the importance of well-being and sustainability in food trends are reflected in the increased consumption of frozen vegetables in Finland. This phenomenon can be seen in frozen peas, for example. The increased popularity of legumes and the ease of using frozen vegetables combined with the uniqueness of Finnish frozen peas have increased the sales of Finnish frozen peas by more than one-third over five years. This the right direction, because adding more vegetables onto the plate is a good choice in every way.""

Significant events in the second quarter of 2025 CLS announced the submission of its 510(k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for expanding the indication of ClearPoint Prism to also include 1.5 T MRI guidance. At the Annual General Meeting, held 27 June 2025, the meeting resolved to re-elect Peter Max as a member of the Board of Directors and to elect Lena Höglund, Veronica Byfield, Thomas Binzer and Jerker Nygren. Peter Max was re-elected as Chairman of the Board. Significant events after the end of the period There were no significant events following the end of the quarter. Comments from CEO Dan J. Mogren The second quarter of 2025 reflects continued strong execution of our strategic and operational priorities and with sales in the quarter at record levels. Continued Revenue Growth & Cost Discipline Revenue grew by 67% compared to Q2 last year, driven by a particularly strong performance in our neurosurgery segment and exceptionally high sales volumes to our partner Clearpoint Neuro. This growth, combined with continued cost discipline, resulted in a gross margin of 70%, well above our full-year target of 60%, and a reduction in operating expenses of more than 30% versus the second quarter of 2024. For the first six months, Revenue growth was 58%, Gross Margin 69% and OPEX reduced more than 30% vs. 2024. U.S.-EU Trade Deal The recently announced U.S.–EU trade deal establishes a general 15% tariff ceiling on most EU goods, but the treatment of medical devices remains uncertain. While discussions continue and the impact on our business is minimal today, we continue to monitor the development. 510(k) Submission under review by US-FDA In late April, CLS submitted its 510(k) application to U.S. FDA to expand the labeling of the ClearPoint Prism® Neuro Laser Therapy System to include image guidance also with 1.5T MRI scanners. The application is currently under FDA review. Upon clearance, this label expansion would significantly broaden patient access to MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (NeuroLITT), allowing for accelerating adoption and growth even further. Strengthening of the Board of Directors In the second quarter, CLS also strengthened its governance with the election of four new members to the Board of Directors, as approved by our shareholders at the AGM on June 27. I am pleased that Peter Max continues in his role as Chairman, providing continuity as we welcome new perspectives and expertise within areas important to CLS, such as the neuro market and supply chain management, to support the company’s next phase of growth. Outlook Remains Strong Our long-term growth outlook remains strong, supported by solid partner relationships, continued market expansion in neurosurgery, and a robust pipeline of opportunities. With revenue growth and margins both exceeding targets, and our cost base structurally lower, we are confident in our ability to sustain high double-digit growth for 2025. Our financial position remains on plan, positioning CLS well ahead of the planned TO8B warrant exercise in September and enabling us to continue creating value for shareholders while advancing the commercial rollout of our technology with our strategic upstream and downstream partners. CLS Vision In a rapidly evolving global environment, it is essential for CLS to combine strong operational execution with a clear long-term vision. Our commitment is to ensure that shareholders, partners, and clinicians remain aligned with the transformative journey we are pursuing. Surgery is entering a new era. Advances in imaging, artificial intelligence, and minimally invasive techniques are converging with the growing medical need created by an increasing incidence of disorders worldwide that require surgery. Together, these factors are accelerating the adoption of image-guided minimally invasive surgery — not only to enhance surgical precision, but also to shorten recovery times, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes. CLS’s vision is to be at the forefront of this transformation. Through our synergistic partnership with Clearpoint Neuro, we are uniquely positioned to lead the global adoption of MR image-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (NeuroLITT) within neurosurgery. By combining CLS’s precision laser ablation technology with Clearpoint Neuro’s advanced neuro-navigation systems, we enable clinicians to safely and effectively treat patients with conditions that have previously been difficult to manage. This sets the stage for a new standard of care in neurosurgery. Looking ahead, we remain committed to building a sustainable business model with recurring revenues, expanding access to our technology, and creating long-term value for patients, healthcare providers, and shareholders alike. Shareholder Value The commitment of our shareholders is instrumental in our progress and in driving our mission to revolutionize the surgical treatment with image-guided precision laser technology. We believe our journey forward will not only advance surgical treatment but also create significant value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to your active participation in the exciting developments to come. Dan J.

Net sales were DKK 73.7 million as compared to DKK 82.3 million in the 1st half of 2024 due to reduction in properties. The increase in EBVAT was primarily driven by decrease in operating expenses due to decrease in properties and control over expenses (DKK 3.7 million) in overhead expenses (employee benefit and other external expenses) by DKK 5.8 million and reduction in financial expenses by (DKK 6.1 million). Group’s equity as of 30 June 2025 was positive at DKK 980 million. The Board of Directors of Park Street A/S discussed and today approved the company's Interim report 2025, which contained the following: The period in outline Park Street's Profit for the Period (after tax and valuation adjustments) is DKK 17.7 million for the 1st half of 2025 (1st half of 2024: DKK 2.9 million. Park Street achieved EBVAT in the first half of 2025 is DKK 13.7 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 6.5 million). Net sales were DKK 73.7 million as compared to DKK 82.3 million in the 1st half of 2024 due to reduction in properties. The increase in EBVAT was primarily driven by decrease in operating expenses due to decrease in properties and control over expenses (DKK 3.7 million) in overhead expenses (employee benefit and other external expenses) by DKK 5.8 million and reduction in financial expenses by (DKK 6.1 million). Group’s equity as of 30 June 2025 was positive at DKK 980 million. Cash flows from operating activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 2.7 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 20.3 million). The decrease is due to change in operating capital (DKK -11.1 million as compared to DKK 13.4 million in the same period last year) offset by lower financial expenses paid (DKK 31.0 million as compared to DKK 37.2 million in the same period last year). Cash flows from investing activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 22.1 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 74.3 million). The decrease is due to sale of investment property (DKK 28 million) in H1 2025 as compared last year of DKK 282 million, offset of DKK 5.9 million spent on improvements to investment properties across the portfolio and purchase of treasury share of DKK 134.9 million in the 1st half of 2024. Cash flows from financing activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 30.1 million (1st half of 2024: -DKK 101.5 million). The decrease in cash flows driven by repayment of liabilities to credit institutions by DKK 30.1 million (1st half of 2024: -DKK 101.5 million). Expectations for 2025 Park Street’s EBVAT expectations have been revised in view of expected repayment of current loan from new mortgage financing. The Company now expects EBVAT in the range of DKK 20 million to DKK 25 million, compared to the earlier guidance of DKK 30 million to DKK 40 million. In addition, the refinancing will result in a one-time, non-cash capitalised borrowing cost of approximately DKK 22 million, which will be recognised in 2025 and further impact reported EBVAT for the year. Management comments on the interim report In connection with the interim report for H1 2025, CEO Pradeep Pattem states the following: “Park Street delivered a strong operating performance in the first half of 2025 with EBVAT of DKK 13.7 million, more than double compared to the same period last year. This was achieved despite lower rental income from asset sales, reflecting disciplined control of costs and reduced financial expenses. We continued our strategic transition with the sale of Stagehøjvej 22, Silkeborg and thereby further reducing exposure to non-core assets. The capital structure has been simplified with the cancellation of 13.8 million treasury shares approved at the AGM. As at the date of this report, Park Street has received a credit-approved term sheet from a mortgage institution for refinancing of the current loan. The company expects to repay the loan at its scheduled maturity through this new financing. While this will result in a one-time non-cash borrowing cost of approximately DKK 22 million, it will strengthen our long-term funding base and reduce future interest costs. Our Pulse strategy remains central to Park Street’s future. Pulse Norrebro continues at full occupancy with a vibrant international community. We will continue to prioritize technology-driven, design-led property management to enhance tenant experience and sustainability outcomes. For 2025, we now expect EBVAT in the range of DKK 20–25 million compared to earlier guidance of DKK 30–40 million, reflecting refinancing effects and timing of disposals. Park Street remains focused on consolidating around core assets including Pulse platform, reducing exposure to retail and regional assets.” Attached files Interim report 2025 is attached to this announcement.

The report has not been audited. The first half of 2025 shows a much stronger result compared to the same period in 2024. Highlights - Interim Report 2025 Revenue was DKK 9,8 million, while Gross Profit was DKK 7,9 million. Operating Profit (EBITDA) was DKK 0,4 million, a significant increase compared to the same period last year, when EBITDA was DKK -1,65 million. Net profit was DKK -0,6 million compared to DKK -1,9 million last year. DAC signed a contract with the European Space Agency ESA to develop and build a prototype of a new exercise device that can be used on the Lunar Gateway space station orbiting the Moon and eventually for human missions to Mars. DAC entered a new area with a subcontract with Adaptix Ltd. of UK to support the development of a ground prototype of a new 3D Bone Quality Imaging System for future use in space. DAC has completed the first two models of its multifunction exercise device E4D under its ESA contract. This “proto-flight model” of E4D (the first model that will be launched) was shipped to ESA and NASA in January for final integration into the launch vehicle. E4D is currently planned for launch to ISS in early 2026. DAC has entered a strategic partnership with NECAS A/S in order to develop and produce advanced technological solutions applicable across the military, space and extreme environment domains. DAC has merged with its subsidiary Danish Aerospace Medical Company A/S with Danish Aerospace Company A/S as the Continuing Company. As the merged has been adopted by the general assembly after 30 June 2025 the merger has not been recognised in the Interim Financial Statements for the period 1 January - 30 June 2025. In the light of the increased number of DAC shareholders the Board of directors have decided to issue quarterly trading updates starting with Q3 2025. Financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 is maintained. Total Revenue (incl. other income) of DKK 21-23 million; and Operating profit (EBITDA) of approx. DKK 1-3 million. CEO, Thomas A. E. Andersen, states: “With the completion of four full models of our new multifunctional exercise equipment for astronauts, E4D, DAC has now mastered this new complex and critical technology. We look forward to enhancing our exercise technology further for use by ESA and NASA on the Lunar Gateway Space Station to orbit the Moon. In parallel, we are pursuing new areas such as 3D Bone Quality Imaging and use of our wearable technologies for national defense applications.” Management review In the first half of 2025, DAC completed and delivered two additional E4D models bringing the number of completed models to four, for two different customers. The delivery in January of the first proto-flight model for ESA and in August the first model for a commercial customer is another major achievement for E4D. In addition, DAC received a contract from ESA for the development of a prototype of an exercise device for the Lunar Gateway space station to orbit the Moon. This prototype will build upon E4D and add an additional jumping exercise capability to it. DAC continues to see increased interest in various DAC technologies, from almost all of the new private commercial space companies. We have recently entered a new small contract with a new one of them. With the new subcontract with Adaptix Ltd. for support of the development of a ground prototype of a new 3D Bone Quality Imaging System for future use in space, DAC is entering a new area with significant future potential. The new strategic collaboration with NECAS A/S will focus on harnessing the unique synergies between NECAS' expertise in production of electronics for the defense industry and DAC’s world-class expertise in developing medical and exercise systems as well as advanced space and extreme environment technologies. Axiom Space’s Ax-4 mission with astronauts from Hungary, Poland, the USA and India completed a 14-day mission to ISS during which some of the crew members used DAC’s Virtual Reality equipment upgraded with a new eye-tracing capability. DACs work on the new full Water Recovery Unit ground prototype for ESA is progressing as planned. DAC continues to pursue new contracts with ESA and US commercial space companies, as well as within the DoD sector, especially with regard to our wearable monitoring technology. Once again in 2025 DAC successfully passed the quality audit, which is the company’s AS/EN9100 standard, rev. D quality control system approval by Bureau Veritas. Expectations for the year The expectations for the year’s revenue and profit as presented in DAC’s Annual Report 2024 are maintained: Total Revenue (incl. other income) of DKK 21-23 million; and Operating profit (EBITDA) of approx. DKK 1-3 million.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits, including its Construction and Operations Plan, following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously in dialogue with permitting agencies and potentially through legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed as quickly as possible with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026. The construction of Revolution Wind is 80 % complete, and the investment required to complete the project amounts to approximately DKK 5 billion for Ørsted’s 50% share of the project. Once complete, Revolution Wind is expected to have an annual run-rate EBITDA contribution of approximately DKK 1 billion. Planned rights issue preparation moves forward according to plan Ørsted will proceed with the planned rights issue preparation and has the continued support and commitment to the rights issue from its majority shareholder, the Danish state. The DKK 60 billion planned rights issue announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement no. 12/2025) is designed to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide the needed financial flexibility and robustness in addition to funding the increased CAPEX requirement to complete Sunrise Wind, absent a partial divestment and non-recourse financing of the project. The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasises the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the US. The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Ørsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Ørsted’s US offshore wind portfolio. Ørsted confirms the timing of the extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 5 September 2025 and will, in due course, revert with further details regarding the launch of the rights issue. Ørsted appoints bank syndicate for rights issue Ørsted has appointed a syndicate of BNP PARIBAS, Danske Bank A/S and J.P. Morgan SE as Joint Global Coordinators next to Morgan Stanley & Co International. Additionally, BofA Securities Europe SA and Goldman Sachs International will act as Joint Bookrunners. The syndicate of banks are jointly underwriting the rights issue for the approximately 49.9 % not covered by the Danish state’s undertaking. Rasmus Errboe, Group President and CEO of Ørsted, said: “Revolution Wind is fully permitted and 80 % complete with all foundations installed and 45 of the 65 wind turbines installed. We’re complying with the order and will work with our US partners and stakeholders to identify a solution as quickly as possible for completing the project and thereby help meet the rapidly growing US demand for power and provide much needed power to over 350,000 homes in the area."" “We appreciate the continued support from our majority shareholder and are pleased with the appointment of a strong consortium of banks as a natural next step towards the launch of our planned rights issue.” Financial update The stop-work order for Revolution Wind does not change Ørsted's financial guidance for 2025. Based on Ørsted’s objective to complete Revolution Wind by the second half 2026, Ørsted confirms its medium-term targets. Ørsted’s 8.1 GW offshore wind projects under construction will, when finalised by the end of 2027, generate an additional DKK 11-12 billion of annual EBITDA. The two US offshore wind projects under construction will account for around DKK 4.5 billion in run-rate EBITDA (50% Revolution Wind and 100% Sunrise Wind ownership). The total investment in the two projects, on a 100 % basis, is expected to be approximately DKK 100 billion. The remaining share of Ørsted investments into the projects is approximately DKK 45 billion. As of 30 June 2025, the carrying value of Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind on Ørsted’s balance sheet amount to approximately DKK 17 billion.

Planned rights issue preparation moves forward according to plan Ørsted will proceed with the planned rights issue preparation and has the continued support and commitment to the rights issue from its majority shareholder, the Danish state. The DKK 60 billion planned rights issue announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement no. 12/2025) is designed to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide the needed financial flexibility and robustness in addition to funding the increased CAPEX requirement to complete Sunrise Wind, absent a partial divestment and non-recourse financing of the project. The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasises the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the US. The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Ørsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Ørsted’s US offshore wind portfolio. Ørsted confirms the timing of the extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 5 September 2025 and will, in due course, revert with further details regarding the launch of the rights issue. Ørsted appoints bank syndicate for rights issue Ørsted has appointed a syndicate of BNP PARIBAS, Danske Bank A/S and J.P. Morgan SE as Joint Global Coordinators next to Morgan Stanley & Co International. Additionally, BofA Securities Europe SA and Goldman Sachs International will act as Joint Bookrunners. The syndicate of banks are jointly underwriting the rights issue for the approximately 49.9 % not covered by the Danish state’s undertaking. Rasmus Errboe, Group President and CEO of Ørsted, said: “Revolution Wind is fully permitted and 80 % complete with all foundations installed and 45 of the 65 wind turbines installed. We’re complying with the order and will work with our US partners and stakeholders to identify a solution as quickly as possible for completing the project and thereby help meet the rapidly growing US demand for power and provide much needed power to over 350,000 homes in the area."" “We appreciate the continued support from our majority shareholder and are pleased with the appointment of a strong consortium of banks as a natural next step towards the launch of our planned rights issue.” Financial update The stop-work order for Revolution Wind does not change Ørsted's financial guidance for 2025. Based on Ørsted’s objective to complete Revolution Wind by the second half 2026, Ørsted confirms its medium-term targets. Ørsted’s 8.1 GW offshore wind projects under construction will, when finalised by the end of 2027, generate an additional DKK 11-12 billion of annual EBITDA. The two US offshore wind projects under construction will account for around DKK 4.5 billion in run-rate EBITDA (50% Revolution Wind and 100% Sunrise Wind ownership). The total investment in the two projects, on a 100 % basis, is expected to be approximately DKK 100 billion. The remaining share of Ørsted investments into the projects is approximately DKK 45 billion. As of 30 June 2025, the carrying value of Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind on Ørsted’s balance sheet amount to approximately DKK 17 billion.

In addition to a number of Danish municipalities, the acquisition also resulted in Dataproces taking over the existing agreements with six German municipalities on Boelplan's solution for population forecasting and capacity planning. A municipality in northern Germany will now be the seventh municipality on the solution. ""The agreement is the first contract that has fallen into place after our acquisition of Boelplan, so it is of course a great pleasure that Dataproces has now been able to penetrate a new market with a huge potential,"" says CEO Michael Binderup. ""So far, the Boelplan solution is still running in Germany. But in the beginning of 2026, we expect to be ready with a new and more modern solution, based on the Dataproces platform KØS. After this, the plan is to intensify the sales efforts in Germany,"" adds Michael Binderup. General about contract announcements as investor news: All announced contracts are in accordance with Dataproces' strategic focus and do not change the announced guidance. As the SaaS platforms MARS, MARC, KØS and KommuneProfilen are central to the guided business strategy, each time a contract is entered into with a new municipality (borth in Denmark and Germany) - as well as an agreement on the expansion of delivery within one of the areas to an already existing customer, if the annual turnover from there is expected to exceed DKK 100,000. Furthermore, an agreement is entered into on the delivery of a Data Analysis assignment where the expected fee is greater than DKK 250,000. Similarly, if agreements are entered into for delivery to a new customer in a new customer group, where the expected fee is greater than DKK 250,000. In announcements regarding danish municipalities, Dataproces distinguishes between three categories of municipality size; The 50 smallest municipalities are referred to as municipalities, the 38 middle municipalities are referred to as larger municipalities and the 10 largest are referred to as top-10 municipalities.

Good July weather in Finland closed part of the Q2 shortfall Very strong performance in Italy, France and the International segment Market share gains across most categories and geographies reflecting strong commercial execution 18% EPS growth, driven by stronger profitability Cash flow for H1 2025 was in line with our plans, and a new share buy-back program of DKK 300m is launched Financial outlook ranges narrowed – we now expect 5-6% net revenue growth (previously 5-7%) and 8-12% EBIT growth (previously 7-13%) for full year 2025 CEO Lars Jensen comments : ""With 11% EBIT growth, we delivered a solid first-half performance in line with our plans, supported by strong execution across most markets. While colder weather in Finland impacted volumes in Q2, this was offset by strong performance in the Western Europe and International segment. These results reflect the increasing geographical diversity of Royal Unibrew and reaffirm the strength of our multi-beverage model. We continue to focus on our growth framework, prioritizing the development of key brands while gradually reducing private label and other lower-margin businesses. With our strategic initiatives progressing well, we remain confident to deliver within our updated full-year guidance ranges and drive long-term shareholder value.” Selected Financial Highlights and Ratios mDKK Q2 2025 Q2 2024 % change H1 2025 H1 2024 % change FY 2024 Volume (mHL ) 5.1 4.8 7 8.8 8.4 4 17.4 Organic volume growth (%) 7 1 4 3 5 Net revenue 4,438 4,180 6 7,644 7,379 4 15,036 Organic net revenue growth (%) 5 4 3 6 6 EBITDA 917 821 12 1,308 1,197 9 2,634 EBITDA margin (%) 20.7 19.6 17.1 16.2 17.5 EBIT 740 656 13 959 866 11 1,968 Organic EBIT growth (%) 11 17 9 16 15 EBIT margin (%) 16.7 15.7 12.5 11.7 13.1 Free cash flow 1,001 1,041 -4 458 560 -18 1,434 ROIC incl. goodwill (%)* 12 12 12 Earnings per share 10.6 9.2 15 13.2 11.2 18 29.2 * Trailing 12 months. Solid H1 2025 Performance The Group delivered a solid performance in the first half of 2025, maintaining momentum in Q2. Volumes increased organically by 4% to 8.8m hectoliters in H1 2025, driven by growth in the Western Europe and International segments. Northern Europe saw a slight decline, primarily due to cold weather in Finland during Q2. However, good July weather in Finland closed part of volume shortfall caused by the weather in Q2. Operating in a consumer environment that remains challenging, but broadly unchanged from 2024, Royal Unibrew is estimated to have gained market share across most markets. Net revenue reached DKK 7,644m, up 3% organically from H1 2024, with no material changes in price/mix. Organic growth was primarily driven by our new activities in Belgium and Luxemburg (BeLux), following the start of the PepsiCo partnership on October 1, 2024. BeLux contributed approximately 3.5% to the Group’s volume growth and 2.5% to net revenue growth in H1 and Q2 2025. EBIT grew organically by 9% to DKK 959m, with the EBIT margin expanding by 80 basis points to 12.5%, reflecting our ongoing efficiency initiatives. The positive margin development was achieved despite increased investments in marketing activities during the period. In the first half of 2025 Royal Unibrew continued to make progress on the ESG agenda, delivering tangible results across key focus areas, with reduced Co2 intensity in production and improved safety performance as notable achievements. Q2 2025 Highlights Organic volume growth accelerated to 7%, reaching 5.1m hectoliters. The higher growth rate in Q2 was primarily driven by the timing of Easter, which fell in Q2 in 2025 and shifted some sales from Q1. Additionally, a strike in Finland contributed to this shift, further moving sales from Q1 to Q2. Underlying market trends remained largely unchanged between the quarters . Net revenue rose organically by 5% to DKK 4,438m in the quarter. Approximately 2.5% of the growth was attributable to the new BeLux activities. EBIT increased organically by 11% to DKK 740m in Q2 2025, with a margin expansion of 100 basis points to 16.7%. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Free cash flow for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 458m, compared to DKK 560m in H1 2024. The development was in line with our plans, supported by higher net profit for the period, but offset by higher capex. Net working capital was reduced by DKK 81m compared to the same time last year, and we expect a positive impact on cash flow from net working capital for the full year. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) stood at DKK 6,374m at the end of H1 2025, up from DKK 5,848m at the end of H1 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to the dividend payment in Q2 2025, whereas in 2024, the dividend was postponed to the fourth quarter. Furthermore, NIBD was impacted by higher capex and the ongoing share buy-back program. The 12-month NIBD/EBITDA ratio was 2.3 at the end of H1 2025 in line with our target level. Share buy-back Program A separate announcement about the launch of a new share buy-back program of up to DKK 300m is issued today. The program will be concluded no later than December 19, 2025. Updated Financial Outlook for full-year 2025 Based on our performance in the first half of 2025 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing the ranges the full-year financial outlook as follows Net revenue growth is now expected in the range of 5-6% (previously 5-7%) EBIT growth is expected in the range of 8-12% (was 7-13%) These adjustments reflect broadly normal summer weather conditions across our markets, resulting in no additional impact on activity levels. Additionally, revenue has been affected by a reduction in private label production and adverse foreign exchange developments. The consumer environment remains challenging but stable compared to 2024, and our assumptions in this area remain unchanged. Other assumptions for guidance are unchanged: Net financial expenses, excluding currency related losses or gains, of around DKK 250m (2024: DKK 301m) Effective tax rate of around 22% (2024: 21.5%) Capex in the range around 7% revenue (2024: 6%) Conference Call Investors and analysts can register for a conference call on August 27, 2025, at 09:00 am CEST at the following links: Webcast: Telephone: For Further Information on This Announcement: Media and Investor Relations: Flemming Ole Nielsen, +45 25 41 68 04, Forward-looking statements This interim report contains forward-looking statements, including statements about the Group’s sales, revenue, earnings, spending, margins, cash flows, inventories, products, actions, plans, strategies, objectives and guidance with respect to the Group’s future operating results.

Focusing on critical application areas for our customers gives us resilience in generally challenging market conditions. Sales increased by 2.8% in the quarter to MSEK 117.9 (114.7), currency-adjusted growth increased by 6.2%. The efficiency work produced visible results and the operating margin, EBIT, increased to 9.2% (1.4). For the period January–June 2025, revenue amounted to MSEK 234.0, with an operating profit of MSEK 19.2 and an operating margin of 8.2%. Despite a challenging market in Europe, we have managed to compensate through increased sales to finance companies in Japan and strong sales in the Nordic region. Newly launched products gain ground During the quarter, we launched two more products; an innovative air cleaner for industrial facilities with limited floor space, FS 60, and a complete cleanroom monitoring solution, QleanGuard. These launches are important steps in our strategy to broaden our offering and strengthen our position in air cleaning for professional environments. In the first half of the year, the products we launched in the last 18 months have accounted for over 30% of units sold in Air Cleaners. We are continuing our work to develop solutions for critical environments and have launched two additional specific application areas with great future potential. Continued good potential in APAC and good activity level in Europe We continue to see a strong potential in APAC, where our strategy to reach more small and medium-sized enterprises in the office, industrial and hospitality (HoReCa) industries is paying off. The Americas also show promising development in cleanrooms, where we landed a first order for a cleanroom worth USD 454, 978 from another major new healthcare organization. We have a good level of activity in Europe and are focusing more on mission-critical areas. During the quarter, we have strengthened our deliveries to the defense industry. Outlook We have a very positive view of the global potential for clean indoor air but maintain our cautious view on the economic situation in Europe. We remain financially strong, with an improved cash flow from operating activities. Our change management to increase growth and profitability in the medium term is progressing according to plan, with the aim of achieving annual organic growth of 10% and an operating margin of 15–20% in the medium term. Our circular business model and our focus on sustainability continue to be a competitive advantage. In June, we delivered 8.24 billion cubic meters of cleaned indoor air per month, which is a 16% increase compared to the same month last year. I would like to thank all our staff for their commitment and our customers for their continued trust. Together, we are building on our vision to become the world leader in stand-alone indoor air cleaning solutions.

Focusing on critical application areas for our customers gives us resilience in generally challenging market conditions. Sales increased by 2.8% in the quarter to MSEK 117.9 (114.7), currency-adjusted growth increased by 6.2%. The efficiency work produced visible results and the operating margin, EBIT, increased to 9.2% (1.4). For the period January–June 2025, revenue amounted to MSEK 234.0, with an operating profit of MSEK 19.2 and an operating margin of 8.2%. Despite a challenging market in Europe, we have managed to compensate through increased sales to finance companies in Japan and strong sales in the Nordic region. Newly launched products gain ground During the quarter, we launched two more products; an innovative air cleaner for industrial facilities with limited floor space, FS 60, and a complete cleanroom monitoring solution, QleanGuard. These launches are important steps in our strategy to broaden our offering and strengthen our position in air cleaning for professional environments. In the first half of the year, the products we launched in the last 18 months have accounted for over 30% of units sold in Air Cleaners. We are continuing our work to develop solutions for critical environments and have launched two additional specific application areas with great future potential. Continued good potential in APAC and good activity level in Europe We continue to see a strong potential in APAC, where our strategy to reach more small and medium-sized enterprises in the office, industrial and hospitality (HoReCa) industries is paying off. The Americas also show promising development in cleanrooms, where we landed a first order for a cleanroom worth USD 454, 978 from another major new healthcare organization. We have a good level of activity in Europe and are focusing more on mission-critical areas. During the quarter, we have strengthened our deliveries to the defense industry. Outlook We have a very positive view of the global potential for clean indoor air but maintain our cautious view on the economic situation in Europe. We remain financially strong, with an improved cash flow from operating activities. Our change management to increase growth and profitability in the medium term is progressing according to plan, with the aim of achieving annual organic growth of 10% and an operating margin of 15–20% in the medium term. Our circular business model and our focus on sustainability continue to be a competitive advantage. In June, we delivered 8.24 billion cubic meters of cleaned indoor air per month, which is a 16% increase compared to the same month last year. I would like to thank all our staff for their commitment and our customers for their continued trust. Together, we are building on our vision to become the world leader in stand-alone indoor air cleaning solutions.

Focusing on critical application areas for our customers gives us resilience in generally challenging market conditions. Sales increased by 2.8% in the quarter to MSEK 117.9 (114.7), currency-adjusted growth increased by 6.2%. The efficiency work produced visible results and the operating margin, EBIT, increased to 9.2% (1.4). For the period January–June 2025, revenue amounted to MSEK 234.0, with an operating profit of MSEK 19.2 and an operating margin of 8.2%. Despite a challenging market in Europe, we have managed to compensate through increased sales to finance companies in Japan and strong sales in the Nordic region. Newly launched products gain ground During the quarter, we launched two more products; an innovative air cleaner for industrial facilities with limited floor space, FS 60, and a complete cleanroom monitoring solution, QleanGuard. These launches are important steps in our strategy to broaden our offering and strengthen our position in air cleaning for professional environments. In the first half of the year, the products we launched in the last 18 months have accounted for over 30% of units sold in Air Cleaners. We are continuing our work to develop solutions for critical environments and have launched two additional specific application areas with great future potential. Continued good potential in APAC and good activity level in Europe We continue to see a strong potential in APAC, where our strategy to reach more small and medium-sized enterprises in the office, industrial and hospitality (HoReCa) industries is paying off. The Americas also show promising development in cleanrooms, where we landed a first order for a cleanroom worth USD 454, 978 from another major new healthcare organization. We have a good level of activity in Europe and are focusing more on mission-critical areas. During the quarter, we have strengthened our deliveries to the defense industry. Outlook We have a very positive view of the global potential for clean indoor air but maintain our cautious view on the economic situation in Europe. We remain financially strong, with an improved cash flow from operating activities. Our change management to increase growth and profitability in the medium term is progressing according to plan, with the aim of achieving annual organic growth of 10% and an operating margin of 15–20% in the medium term. Our circular business model and our focus on sustainability continue to be a competitive advantage. In June, we delivered 8.24 billion cubic meters of cleaned indoor air per month, which is a 16% increase compared to the same month last year. I would like to thank all our staff for their commitment and our customers for their continued trust. Together, we are building on our vision to become the world leader in stand-alone indoor air cleaning solutions.

While maintaining this solid growth rate, the Company has continued its focus on operating expenses, efficiency and cash flow. The growth in ARR is not fully reflected in the booked revenue for the full fiscal year, as most new signings of new clients came late in the fiscal year. Cash flow continues to be monitored closely. While we are not yet in positive EBITDA territory, we have made significant strides towards that goal and expect to be in EBITDA positive territory during the coming fiscal year. During the Period our pipeline grew, and our expanding list of large global reference clients continues to generate interest in Loyal Solutions. We had the pleasure of adding the longest running loyalty program in Denmark, Forbrugsforeningen af 1886, as a client and contracted our first client in a new vertical, telecommunications, when E& (formerly Etisalat) joined as client. In May Virgin Velocity launched “Pay with Points” an innovative solution powered by Loyal Solutions technology. In June Emirates Skywards added redemption of points at over 1.000 locations in the UAE to their very successful Skywards Everyday program powered by Loyal Solution`s technology, providing added benefits for their members. Our sales lead times remain lengthy, as we sell strategic long-term partnerships to large clients, who all have evolved processes for procurement. We are continuously working on improving lead times in cooperation with our sales partners Our sales cooperation with Visa for the Visa VMLS product has also progressed as expected. The Company`s LoyalTfacts® SaaS based payment/card-linking platform and technology continues to be viewed by clients as market leading. Our brand positioning focuses on quality, compliance and security, value and ROI for our clients. Our current clients` programs continued to perform very well during the Period, further validating our SaaS business model, and proving the inherent long term growth potential in SaaS payment/card-linked loyalty programs. While at different stages of maturity, all current programs achieved satisfactory core growth rates year-on-year, and with several clients now expanding their programs into more countries, we have a firm client base on which to build future growth. Our most important resource, our employees, continued to do an outstanding job. Despite being busy, we have maintained our focus on work-life balance, inclusivity and on providing flexible working hours and locations. Our IT hub in South Africa has been an integral part in delivering solutions and our IT organization benefits from having operations in both Denmark and South Africa.

Gentoo Media today announces its interim results for the second quarter of 2025. The quarter marked the completion of the strategic realignment initiated in Q1, streamlining and stabilising the business and sharpening the operational focus. As a result, Gentoo Media enters the second half of the year aligned for long-term value creation. Q2 2025 Financial Highlights ● Revenue: EUR 24.4 million (EUR 30.2 million), down 19% YoY, flat QoQ ● EBITDA before special items: EUR 7.5 million (EUR 14.8 million), margin 31% (49%). ● Cash flow from operations: EUR 7.7 million (EUR 6.2 million) Q2 performance reflects deliberate operational recalibration, market softness in Brazil, and seasonal impact from the absence of major sports events. Importantly, material cost reductions were executed as planned, with EBITDA margins returning above 40% in June. Marketing investments during the quarter drove a 43% increase in player intake QoQ and elevated deposit values to EUR 195 million. Despite these positive developments in underlying business drivers, revenue has developed below expectations. Updated Full-Year 2025 Guidance Management has refined its full-year outlook to reflect the current pace of improvement and strategic realignment: ● Revenue: EUR 100–105 million ● EBITDA before special items: EUR 40–43 million ● EBITDA Margin: 40%–41% ● Free cash flow from operations: EUR 27–30 million Cash flow from investment activities EUR -38 million. Investment outflows primarily reflect M&A and demerger costs initiated in 2024, with EUR 34.3 million already paid by the end of July 2025. These are now largely concluded. Looking ahead Gentoo Media enters the second half of 2025 as a leaner, sharper, and more agile business. The foundation laid in Q2 is already translating into stronger underlying performance. Growth in player intake, improved marketing efficiency, and positive post-quarter signals from the Brazilian market all reinforce the outlook for H2. Optimisation across our Publishing and Paid Media portfolios - including a positive Google Core update and recalibrated acquisition model - further strengthen our position for the second half of the year.

The annual total payment volume is expected to amount to SEK 20 billion once all the new agreements are live (>+40% compared with LTM). Income in the quarter benefited from growth in the SME segment. At the same time income has been impacted by several factors, subduing the overall picture of an otherwise operationally strong quarter with accelerating growth in total payment volume of 37%. The total payment volume increased by 37% to SEK 4.1 billion in the quarter. After three consecutive quarters of negative growth the BNPL volume showed signs of stabilising in Q2 (+1%). In addition the BNPL share increased in July, at the same time as the BNPL volume rose by 9%. Both BNPL share and volume improved in July by +9%. Nevertheless, the BNPL volume is lower than previously expected, which means we expect the forecast income growth to be delayed and realised towards the end of the year. We currently estimate that operating income growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 will be around 15 per cent. Growth is subsequently expected to accelerate into 2026 as income gradually catches up with volume.” Presentation of the Interim Report Today, August 26, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. CEO Christoffer Rutgersson and CFO Carl Löfgren will present the Interim Report for Q2 2025.

The Half-Year Report in its entirety is attached to this release and available at the website . As expected, the half-year result (change in net position) remained in deficit, which was due to lower unemployment insurance contributions and high unemployment. However, the deficit was smaller than in the comparison period. As expected, during the first half of the year, the amount of unemployment insurance contributions collected by Employment Fund remained well below the totals collected during the comparison period. This was because the unemployment insurance contributions for 2025 were lowered as proposed by Employment Fund. The financing contributions paid by the Fund to benefit recipients were also substantially lower than in the previous year even though unemployment was higher than in the comparison period. The impacts of the measures set out in the Government Programme began to show in the first half of the year. Key figures January–June 2025 Key figures, EUR million 1 Jan–30 Jun 2025 1 Jan–30 Jun 2024 1 Jan–31 Dec 2024 Unemployment insurance contributions and other income 956 1,159 2,347 Financing contributions paid and administrative expenses -1,410 -1,666 -3,163 Net financial income 20 27 67 Change in net position -435 -480 -749 Investment assets and cash and cash equivalents 1,067 1,741 1,513 Receivables, accruals and fixed assets 462 526 447 Short-term and long-term loans 599 599 599 Unemployment insurance contribution and other liabilities 92 127 89 Net position 838 1,541 1,272 Unemployment insurance contribution (average) 1.20% 1.61% 1.61% Change in total payroll* 2.1% 2.1% 2.2% Unemployment rate (average) 9.9% 8.8% 8.4% Return on investments 1.6% 1.6% 4.2% *Change in cumulative payroll during the reporting period compared to corresponding payroll in the same period in the previous year. Calculated on the basis of the wages and salaries subject to unemployment insurance contributions. Managing Director Janne Metsämäki The economy and the employment situation have developed less favourably than forecast during the first half of the year, which has been reflected in a higher than expected unemployment. There are currently a number of uncertainties affecting the global economy. The trade war and the tariff disputes may have significant negative impacts on the Finnish economy. The war in Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East also have economic impacts even though it is difficult to predict how they will develop. We lowered the forecast for Employment Fund’s results for this year in April. We estimate that the deficit will be higher than previously anticipated. We also estimated that the employer’s and employee’s unemployment insurance contributions would have to be increased by 0.5–1.5 percentage points for the year 2026. Even if the contributions were increased by this amount for 2026, they would remain lower than before the lowering of the contributions for 2024 and 2025. We will present our proposal for the contribution levels at the end of August. Even though the Finnish economy is slowing down and unemployment is on the increase, our liquidity remained solid throughout the first half of the year and we have successfully managed all our unemployment security and other social security financing tasks. Numerous legislative projects A large number of projects to amend the legislation pertaining to Employment Fund have been under way during the review period. They include the reform of the Act on the Financing of Unemployment Benefits, universal support, combinatory insurance, universal earnings-related benefit model, shortening of the lay-off notice period and abolition of the training compensation. We have taken part in the preparatory work coordinated by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, commented on draft legislative proposals and memoranda and submitted statements. For Employment Fund, combinatory insurance would mean a new benefit that would be f inanced by the Fund. It is estimated that the model would increase the expenditure of Employment Fund by about EUR 10 million. Shortening of the lay-off notice period is expected to increase the expenditure of Half-year Report 1 Jan–30 Jun 2025 Managing Director’s review 6 Employment Fund, and the estimates vary from negligible sums to up to EUR 40 million. The training compensation has involved a minor implementation task totalling about EUR 10 million and it has been fully financed by the government. Abolition of the compensation would not affect the balance between Employment Fund’s income and expenses and it would not lead to any personnel changes. In accordance with the Government Programme, the Government discussed a report on the universal earnings-related benefit model in its mid-term policy review session. Introduction of the universal model would significantly increase unemployment security expenditure. The Government decided that no preparatory work would be launched on the basis of the report. On 1 January 2025, the responsibility for organising employment services was transferred from central government to employment areas formed by municipalities. As part of this change, municipalities’ responsibility for the financing of unemployment security was expanded to partially cover the basic part of the earningsrelated daily allowance, which reduced the government contribution by the same amount. From the perspective of Employment Fund, the reform has resulted in minor changes in the unemployment security funding process but has not affected our financing task. Implementation of the Fund’s strategy is progressing Implementation of Employment Fund’s strategy, which was updated in December 2024, was launched during the first half of the year. Producing customer-oriented services for the digital age in a reliable and high-quality manner, and boosting productivity and efficiency are our strategic goals. To monitor the achievement of these goals, we have prepared indicators that we use to regularly report on the progress towards the goals to the Fund’s Board of Directors. During the first half of the year, we have largely completed the transfer of our IT services to a new supplier and the construction of the required IT capabilities. In its strategic projects, the Fund uses IT capabilities to build more efficient digital services and to enhance the customer experience. A good example of these is the ongoing project in which we are updating our unemployment insurance contribution services. The shutdown of the adult education allowance scheme has continued in accordance with the timetable specified in the law. The amount of allowances paid has already decreased significantly compared to 2024. At the same time, customer satisfaction has remained at excellent level. Changes I announced in February that I would retire at the end of 2025. By that date, I will have served a total of 11 years as the Managing Director of Employment Fund, and its predecessors, the Unemployment Insurance Fund and the Education Fund. These years have been characterised by change, progress, challenges and successes. My aim has always been to ensure that the Fund can develop and change so that it can perform its statutory tasks in a changing operating environment with maximum success. Excellence and talent create a solid basis for a successful Employment Fund. Karo Nukarinen, who currently serves as Employment Fund’s Chief Financial Officer, will start as the new Managing Director on 1 January 2026. The successes of the first half of the year have been the result of a cooperative effort by our personnel and our stakeholders. In particular, I would like to thank the Employment Fund’s personnel for their dedication and excellent work during the past six months and over all these years. Employment Fund’s operating environment The European Central Bank has made substantial cuts in interest rates and inflation in Finland has remained low. Despite this, economic growth remains sluggish and total output in Finland is expected to grow by about one per cent in 2025. Slow economic growth has been reflected in a deteriorating employment situation, and the unemployment rate has continued to increase during the first half of the year. Despite rising unemployment, the financing contributions paid by Employment Fund have decreased as the impacts of the measures reducing unemployment security set out in the Programme of Prime Minister Petteri Orpo’s Government are gradually being felt. Outlook for the end of the year In the payment estimate submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health in April 2025, we estimated that the change in Employment Fund’s net position would be negative to the amount of about EUR 840 million in 2025 and net position positive to the amount of about EUR 430 million at the end of 2025. When preparing the half-yearly financial statements, we estimated that the change in Employment Fund’s net position would be negative to the amount of about EUR 740 million in 2025, which would mean a positive net position of about EUR 530 million at the end of 2025.

The normalised pre-tax result of €2 thousand in the quarter represents an improvement of €0,7 million over Q2 2024. The VA S-Europe division reported sales of €52.9 million in the second quarter, marking a 3% increase from the same period in 2024. Sales for the year's first half increased by 3% in value and 1% in volume compared to 1H 2024. The division's normalised pre-tax profit stood at €2.2 million, the same as for the same period in 2024. Strong sales of premium products, particularly cod and other Icelandic offerings, positively impacted sales value and volume. The production volume of Argentinean shrimp was high but had a lower yield due to the production mix. Sales of Ahumados decreased by 4% in value and volume during 1H 2025. The VA N-Europe division achieved sales of €14.3 million, a 5% rise from Q2 last year. Sales for the first half totalled €28.6 million, up from €26.5 million in the same period of 2024. Lower-than-expected salmon prices at the beginning of the year and into the second quarter positively impacted the operation. In contrast, high prices and the decreased availability of white fish had an opposing impact on the division. The pre-tax profit in Q2 was €0.4 million, up from a loss of (€0.1 million) in the same quarter last year. Price of salmon is expected to remain stable for the rest of the year, with a potential increase toward the end of the year. The S&D division experienced a strong start to the year, driven by robust sales from Iceland, and sustained this momentum through Q2. Strong frozen-at-sea sales, supported by high cod demand, fuelled IS Iceland’s impressive performance during the quarter. Based on the Q2 results and current trading, the normalised PBT outlook 2025 remains between €7.5 million and €9.5 million. We anticipate that cod prices will stay high, while salmon prices will likely remain stable throughout the year. All divisions are expected to deliver on budget, driven by robust fish demand even in the face of higher prices. Ægir Páll Friðbertsson , CEO Ægir Páll Friðbertsson, CEO: "" The first half of 2025 was marked by strong demand for cod and record-high prices. The U.S. ban on Russian fish has pushed up prices for HG cod from the Barents Sea, compounded by quota reductions in both the Barents Sea and the Atlantic. A limited supply of whitefish and elevated prices are expected to persist. Salmon prices were lower than forecasted in the year's first half, resulting in strong operational performance in our salmon operations—unlike the previous two years, when they showed operational loss. Performance in 1H 2025 was significantly better than in 1H 2024, and the outlook for the remainder of the year is positive. We expect salmon prices to remain stable through Q3 and into the latter part of Q4. Our economic outlook remains uncertain and is expected to stay that way. Interest rates have eased, and inflation has declined in our main markets. While high cod prices and rising prices for other species have increased sales values, they also create challenges as consumers face higher costs. As a result, demand may decline further, driven by reduced availability and price increases in key markets. At the same time, financing and storage costs remain significant, reinforcing the need for vigilant credit and inventory management. Our primary focus remains on enhancing the performance of our existing business units, continuously optimising the company’s capital structure, and reassessing our overall strategy. These priorities will guide us in the coming months. We see significant potential for growth within our strong company network, robust sales and sourcing channels, and our highly skilled team of seafood professionals. In July, we took an important step to strengthen our operations in Argentina by signing an offer letter to acquire two vessels, building on our existing knowledge, expertise, and established business in the region. The growth of Icelandic salmon farming is another encouraging development. We have started selling and marketing Icelandic salmon through our network, and we aim to expand this as salmon farming continues to grow in Iceland."" We aim to reinforce Iceland Seafood’s position to navigate future challenges and seize emerging opportunities, ultimately benefiting the company, its owners, and our staff.""

This is a testament to the innovative products that Intellego provides to the market and our close collaborations with our customers e.g. Henkel and Likang. It also shows that Intellego’s work with shortening payment times is starting to have results, which we expect to continue to improve during the year. In addition, we do see that our sales continue to accelerate in all business areas which is driven by our improving sales work, Intellego becoming a more recognized brand and new regulations (for example in the US where the FDA is now starting to regulate UV disinfection devices). Another factor is an increasing price point where we charge higher prices in new application areas compared to, e.g., disinfection. Due to our increasing growth, Intellego hereby raises its 2025 financial goals to over 700 million (265) SEK in revenue and over 400 million (102) SEK in EBIT. If the company achieves these numbers, it will mean an increase in revenue of approximately 164% and 292% increase in EBIT on a yearly basis. During Q2 the company continued its focus on cash generation, which contributed to a cash balance of around 100 million SEK at the end of the quarter. At the same time, we continue to invest in future growth. An example is market investments which Intellego does with its partners and, during Q2, approximately 10 MSEK was invested in these collaborations, from the company’s operating cashflow. The basic reason for these investments is that the company sees that these investments can significantly alter the financial curve of the group resulting in financial results greatly exceeding previously communicated goals. The results from these investments will be seen on both a short term and long term basis, based on the order inflow that the group sees. The increased cash generation will mainly be used for the group’s continued expansion and to pay down debt. General market update: During Q2 we have seen that regulations and industry standards for UV disinfection have started to spread across the world. This began in China and now the FDA is getting involved over in the US and Canada has started to implement regulations. This is a welcome development and something we believe couldn’t come soon enough. In Intellego we have always wondered about UV disinfection being used with almost no way of assuring UV exposure levels in each disinfection run. We found it odd that in a similar, adjacent area such as sterilization, regulatory standards mandated validation in the shape of color indicators for each sterilization process and we assumed the reason for the different treatments was simply the emerging nature of UVC disinfection, which only stepped onto the main stage during COVID. The rise of the regulatory drive to require and enforce validation in healthcare settings is both important for end users of these facilities, important for the industry and significant to our company. We think this drive is just beginning. In the UV curing industry there are no regulations which require quality control, but curing is a well-developed production method which is being conducted globally 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Having a reliable UV curing production line is key to avoiding product recalls which for example can be seen in medical device production. There, you use UV curing as a production step in order to cure adhesives. If these adhesives are not UV cured sufficiently there is a risk that these medical devices will have to be recalled which will cause significant direct costs and most likely legal liability for the producer/brand. Intellego indicators can be an effective way to quality assure that the UV curing process is being done correctly on a consistent basis. Medical devices are only one example and UV curing has been used in production of many of the day to day products we have around us such as the electronics we use (cell phones, computers, etc), which gives an indication of the market size. The curing market is global and its much larger than on the PSA side. It is a market where we have seen especially strong progress in Q2 and this is expected to continue. We have several ongoing partnerships in the UV curing space and one indication for the future is the message we received from one of the world largest curing companies recently saying: “Dear Claes & Team, With great appreciation, we celebrate a milestone that reflects the strength of our collaboration at our new and & innovative product, born from years of co-development and shared ambition beyond our core competencies. The first batch production marks not only a commercial step forward, but also a testament to the agility, openness and mutual trust that define our partnership. I appreciated what we have built together and even more excited about what lies ahead – new ideas, new opportunities and continued momentum.” Tariffs: In the last year we have seen that new tariffs have come into place but Intellego does not currently foresee that these tariffs will have a significant effect on its business. Collaborations: Two of our major collaborations, with Henkel and Likang, are developing better than expected. Both projects generate revenue on a reoccurring basis and volumes are increasing. At the time of this report, Likang and its group are continuing their expansion outside of China into the rest of the Asia region. With Henkel, we are still discussing a global distribution agreement, but that is secondary to our mutual focus on selling the products in the market and the global launch, which is the most important thing. In addition to existing sales, Intellego is also involved in several development projects which we will inform about as soon as there is concrete and relevant information to share. One of these projects is the collaboration we have with HAI Solutions which is making good progress. HAI Solutions’ product has been registered and launched in New Zealand and we are approaching a market approval in the US, which is expected to come from the FDA by the end of this year. In addition, we are working on several new projects with a total of 12 new products under development and where we have a paying customer which has pre-ordered the product. Closing remarks: Intellego’s improving results come from our continuous work to improve every aspect of our business. Furthermore, the disinfection business in particular is expected to benefit from new market standards and new regulations where UV disinfection devices are facing more stringent demands for quality control. Based on this and the progress the company has made over past months, the management and board are now in the process of reviewing our 3-5 year goals, which will be revised later this year.

The EGM also resolved to authorize the Board of Directors to determine the record date for the reverse split. The Board has decided that the record date for the reverse split will be September 4, 2025. As a result of the reverse split, FPC’s B-shares will change its ISIN code. As of September 3, 2025, the B-shares will be traded under the new ISIN code SE0026141665. From this date, the share price will reflect the effect of the reverse split. The Company’s non-listed A-share will as of September 3, 2025, have the ISIN code SE0026141657. Following the reverse split, the total number of shares in the Company will decrease from 15,175,375,766 shares (7,875,000 A-shares and 15,167,500,766 B-shares) and 15,246,250,766 votes to 7,587,687 shares (3,937 A-shares and 7,583,750 B-shares) and 7,623,120 votes. Each share will have a quota value of SEK 21.353477 after the reverse split. Shareholders will automatically receive a new, lower number of shares in proportion to their holdings as of the record date on September 4, 2025. Shareholders whose holdings on the record date for the aggregation is not even evenly divisible with 2,000 will be rounded down. Excess fractions of B-shares will be aggregated and sold by the Company, whereby eligible shareholders will receive their share of the sale proceeds. Such sale of share fractions is expected to be carried out mid September 2025 and the sales proceeds for the sold fractions is expected to be paid by the end of September 2025. The reverse share split would mean that the Company’s Class A and Class B shares will be subject to a reverse split at a ratio of 1:2,000, resulting in one (1) share for every two thousand (2,000) existing shares of the same class, with all class-specific rights and characteristics remaining unchanged. After the reverse share split has been completed, the number of shares and votes in the Company, based on the current number of outstanding shares, will decrease from 15,175,375,766 shares (7,875,000 A-shares and 15,167,500,766 B-shares) and 15,246,250,766 votes to 7,587,687 shares (3,937 A-shares and 7,583,750 B-shares) and 7,623,120 votes. Timeline for the reverse share split: September 2, 2025 – Last day of trading in FPC’s B-share before the reverse split. September 3, 2025 – First day of trading in FPC’s B-share after the reverse split. This means that the share price from this day onward will reflect the effect of the reverse split. September 4, 2025 – Record date for the reverse split.

Adjusted for significant negative currency effects from the USD and EUR, underlying growth was a solid 12% in the quarter. Gross profit amounted to SEK 82.8 (81.0) million, equivalent to the corresponding period of the previous year. Gross margin amounted to 90% (90%). EBITDA improved to SEK 1.0 (-23.2) million.

Gross margin amounted to 89% (90%). EBITDA improved to SEK -16.9 (-46.2) million. Excluding FX effects and one-time items in the first quarter, underlying EBITDA has improved significantly during this period. Operating results amounted to SEK -101.9 (-125.7) million, whereas the amortization of the surplus value, regarding acquisition of Affectiva and iMotions, amounted to SEK -55.4 (-57.6) million. Result after financial items amounted to SEK -109.3 (-124.9) million. Earnings after tax per share were -2.47 (-2.99), and after full dilution -2.47 (-2.99). Comments from the CEO Quarter two came in almost precisely according to our planned base case, with organic growth coming in at a solid 12%. One thing deviated slightly, namely the strengthening of the Swedish krona which affected us more than anticipated. It decreased both topline and Opex, with net effect being positive EBITDA for the first time in a long while, +1 MSEK. Without FX effects our comparable EBITDA came in at +7 MSEK. Our target for cost savings was achieved with some margin, and we anticipate continued low operational expenses in the third quarter. Together with steady acceleration of the license revenues, quarter three is expected to become even stronger, as per our previous communication. Automotive The main takeaway in Q2 was the acceleration of the OEM production programs, as was observed by the surge in license revenue. This is the well-earned reward for many years of hard work, first to secure the contracts and then to deliver the production-ready software. It’s incredibly satisfying to see the number of manufactured cars increase from all geographic markets. Japan, Korea, China, Europe and US, all of them are finally rolling out, with license growth substantially above 100%. A total of 90 models has entered production with 12 OEMs, and we expect that number to continue to increase rapidly. As the non-license revenue decreased, it resulted in 42% organic growth for the whole business unit. We are in the race for several large ongoing procurements, and as usual we are standing strong thanks to the industry’s by far most complete product portfolio combined with our solid reputation as a high quality, trustworthy and dependable supplier. The fact that we have successfully turned around the company financially is positive. It helps us by decreasing the risk and comforting our present and future customers, the world’s largest OEMs. There is continued consolidation going on in the interior sensing industry and two competitors have merged with larger companies during the period, driven by the need for economies of scale, only available for a select few market players including Smart Eye. Behavioral Research We came in slightly below target, mainly because of FX and continued headwinds in the US. Other markets have been delivering as expected. We landed in the end with organic growth of -1% for the business area. However, looking at the whole market, we performed better than industry peers, meaning that we likely are increasing our market share. We have seen some positive signs during the summer, so we expect a strong second half of the year, particularly a solid fourth quarter supported by seasonal effects. The business area is both profitable and cash flow positive at current levels. Final Words During the spring we recognized that our cost-saving initiatives, combined with license volumes ramp-up, might be enough for positive EBITDA as early as Q2 – and by a narrow margin we succeeded. It opens the door for alternative and more attractive financing options, since it makes us eligible for regular bank credit, should it be needed or wanted. We expect the coming quarters to be continuously stronger as our customers roll out their car programs. We ended the quarter with 94 MSEK in cash and credit facilities, which we consider sufficient given the strong outlook in the coming quarters. No further cost-saving measures are planned at this stage. Martin Krantz CEO Smart Eye Find the full report and all previous financial reports at .

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE PERIOD * On July, 28, AcouSort announced that that the prestigious US National Institute of Health / National Cancer Institute has published a new article in Scientific Reports on developing processes for radiolabeling using AcouSort’s AcouWash technology. CEO statement Q2 2025 Further promising collaborations and strengthened finances In the second quarter of this year, we continued tirelessly to strengthen our presence in the flow cytometry and cell therapy spaces, with new fruitful interactions and collaborations that will ultimately boost AcouSort. We also concluded a rights issue that gives us the financial stability to continue the business development of our innovative technology. Total income in the quarter amounted to MSEK 2.9 (2.0), of which royalty income amounted to MSEK 1.3 (0.8) and is expected to reach at least MSEK 5.25 for the full year. MORE FRUITFUL PARTNERSHIPS ESTABLISHED Our core strategy is to achieve commercial success by establishing close collaborations with life science companies, with the critical aim to launch long-term Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) partnerships around diagnostic equipment, cell therapy production systems, flow cytometry instruments, and quality control technologies. The ultimate goal is of course a product launch, but almost equally important for us is to reach the stage in the collaboration where our partners initiate what we call formal product development. This strategy continues to develop very well, with a number of important contracts signed so far in 2025, of which the latest one came in late May when we received a second order from a Central European company that develops diagnostic systems and medical devices. The company is evaluating our technology for separation of cells in body fluids. This is a great example of a collaboration that fits perfectly with our long-term strategy. We are excited by the first results from the evaluations and hope to share additional information about the project as the test program moves forward. The collaboration was originally initiated in mid-autumn 2024 by an order of an evaluation kit that was delivered to the partner before Christmas. The project has now continued with an order of additional types of separation modules to continue the process of evaluating the broader feasibility of AcouSort’s technology. This is an important step in building long-term collaborations with OEM potential. In October 2024, we announced a new collaboration with a leading pharma company. Focus for the initial part of collaboration was to explore the potential of AcouWash technology in the partnering company’s QC procedures, initially in an R&D setting. To date, the evaluation of the AcouWash technology has been highly successful. In April, due to successful evaluation data, our partner decided to prolong the evaluation with another six months to finalize their evaluation process. The total value of the extension of the collaboration is EUR 11,300. Pending results of the finalization study, we will pursue extension of this important collaboration and provide the customer with a solution for long-term implementation in their process. RIGHTS ISSUE GIVES US FINANCIAL STABILITY To fulfil our ambitious development program and continue to seek new partnerships, we closed a partially secured rights issue on May 5. It was subscribed to a total of about 73 percent, with approximately 51 percent subscribed by underwriters. The proceeds amounted to MSEK 24.9 before issuing costs and are intended to be used to moving current and future collaborations into fully-fledged OEM partnerships over the next 16-18 months. Together with known income, such as royalties and public funding, as well as projected product and project revenues, the rights issue is aimed at funding our business development activities at least into 2027. In parallel, we continue to identify and discuss with different stakeholders to obtain an investor structure with a long-term vision that can take AcouSort all the way to successful and profitable commercialization. These activities started late 2024 and will continue undiminished in 2025. We are fully committed to further expanding the impact of AcouSort’s unique technology in the Life Science sector and secure the financial support to achieve this. BUSY PERIOD FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT The first contacts with potential partners are typically made at international conferences and trade fairs, and it is very important for us to be present at different significant international events where we have the possibility to meet new partners, as well as continue developing our relationships with existing ones. I am pleased to say that we are well recognized in the scientific community, and a sign of this is the invitation we received to participate in a panel discussion at the international trade fair BIO 2025 in Boston, MA, in June. AcouSort was one of 15 companies selected by the European Innovation Council (EIC) for participation in the European Pavilion at BIO 2025. The delegates were selected based on their internationalization goals, technological fit with the scope of the trade fair, as well as their capacity to create business through their participation. BIO 2025 is one of the most important conferences in the healthcare and biotech industry, where most leading companies are represented and which will provide us with a great opportunity to keep extending our reach within the rapidly evolving healthcare space. In the session, titled Digital, wireless, smart: Integrated care in the clinic , I presented AcouSort’s innovative technology and exemplified how automated sample preparation is an important cornerstone in the healthcare future. We plan to attend several more conferences in 2025 where we can demonstrate our technology and meet companies that are working on current and next generation cell therapies where AcouSort has the potential to play a vital role. The significantly increased influx of new potential OEM projects proves that our intensified marketing efforts at conferences and trade fairs is paying off. It is also very rewarding that our projects are being published in scientific journals. After the period, we announced that Scientific Reports, part of the Nature publishing house, had published a new article by the prestigious US National Institute of Health / National Cancer Institute (NIH/NCI) on developing processes for radiolabeling using AcouSort’s AcouWash technology. We are very pleased that the NIH, which is an important reference customer, has produced additional positive results in their new study. This also verifies our strategy of using benchtop systems as platforms for developing applications of our technology. OUTLOOK Backed by a stable financial position, a very talented organization, and a growing network of partners, we will continue to strengthen our positions in diagnostics, cell therapy, flow cytometry and quality control. By continuing to develop existing and future partnerships over the coming year, our focus is to take AcouSort to the next exciting stage and shape the future of the company. I will keep you updated as we make progress in our projects.

Roeland Baan, CEO of Topsoe: ​ “Our financial performance in the first half of 2025 was impacted by uncertainty in the market globally, which resulted in key customer projects being postponed. Our strong underlying business enabled us to keep a strong market position, and thanks to our flexible production setup and our diligent focus on cost, we managed to support our operational performance and earnings. Despite the current global market challenges, we remain confident in the long-term growth of fuels and chemicals for the energy transition. We will continue to take a leading role in providing advanced science-based solutions for conventional fuels and the decarbonization of energy-intensive industries and long-distance transportation. We’re excited that our Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) manufacturing facility in Herning, Denmark, is nearing the final stage of readiness for industrial-scale production. With this flagship project, we’re taking a significant step forward in scaling the technologies needed to produce green hydrogen and derivatives, such as e-ammonia and e-methanol.” ​ Topsoe experienced a lower revenue in the Catalyst and Technology businesses compared to 2024, mainly due to market uncertainty causing orders and projects to be postponed globally. Revenue from the Catalyst business decreased by 10 % and from the Technology business by 14 %.

The report is available on Bawat’s website (investor.bawat.com) BAWAT is a leading supplier of sustainable ballast water treatment technology and services. BAWAT was listed on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market in Stockholm in March 2022. Bawat in positive EBITDA figures from June onwards. Backlog volume supports positive EBITDA for second half year of 2025. BaaS (Ballast-as-a-Service) is driving profitability. Gross Profit % was 43,0 %, compared with 13,2% in H1 2024 and higher than earlier guidance. EBITDA for H1 was SEK - 9,9m. For the month of June, EBITDA was positive. EBITDA is expected to be positive for H2 2025. A major step for Bawat. EBITDA and Gross Profit is driven by a significant increase in Baas (Ballast-as-a-Service) delivered in Holland, Belgium, Germany, Spain and Denmark for a variety of clients and project types. The positive development in business activities came later than expected as Bawat only started executing on the backlog BaaS volume signed already in late 2024 with a ship recycling client due to external factors. Additional new BaaS capacity will deliver in Q3 supporting growth. With the Hong Kong convention on ship re-cycling coming into force in late June, ballast water on ships for re-cycling has become a hazardous material that needs disposal, and thus Bawat is expecting a further uptake from this business segment in H2 2025 and onwards. Post closing, Bawat has in addition to other orders received a large BaaS contract in Germany for execution in September signed for delivery of D2 compliant ballast water. This delivery to vessels is to Bawat knowledge a first of its kind and only possible due to the unique one-pass technology Bawat BaaS is based upon. Bawat has had initial dialogue regarding supply of water on land for various purposes treated by Bawat for invasive species. This market could potentially be significant utilizing Bawats existing technology unchanged. Bawat is post closure in dialogue with our lenders to prolong the repayment profile of the long-term debt. A Concentrated Inspection Campaign (CIC) will be conducted across the world by port state controls starting September 2025. Expectations are that it will gradually increase awareness of non-functional BWMS and the need to use Port Reception Facilities including Bawats BaaS’ solution. FINANCIAL KEY FIGURES H1 2025 SEK '1.000 H1 2025 H1 2024 12M 2024 Sales 8.328 8.786 14.584 Gross Profit 3.581 1.155 2.324 Gross Profit % 43,0% 13,2% 15,9% EBITDA -9.913 -12.381 -23.595 Result for the period -14.863 -21.562 -41.314 Earnings per share -0,17 -0,39 -0,66 Cash flow from operations* -14.049 -11.871 -25.275 Net working capital -13 -3.978 -1.772 Equity ratio % -52,1% -47,9% -41,3% *In addition to this, Capital raise and other related non-recurrent items SEK 1.6m in H1 ’24 (SEK 0.4m in H1 ’24 & 3.1 in FY 2024) Marcus P. Hummer, CEO. “2025 is a pivotal year for Bawat. We are now moving into black EBITDA figures for the second half of the year and our BaaS activity is driving this. We are however also experiencing an increase in demand for both our mobile systems and ship board systems as customers with non-compliant ballast water acknowledge the value of having a BWMS that works in all conditions”. “We have a unique product offering to support the spread of invasive species in the marine environment. Port State Control and local environmental authorities have all options open to enforce the legislation. We expect the Concentrated Inspection Campaign starting September across the world will highlight the massive need for Port Reception Facilities in order for ballast water discharge to stay compliant – in ports, at yards and at sea”. Guidance 2025 The Company has gradually changed its emphasis to more focus on sales of our mobile solutions and in particular BaaS solutions but still offering our unique pasteurization solutions to vessels. So in essence Bawat has three legs to stand on based on same unique and patented technology, pasteurization. Following the final adoption of the ballast water convention on 8th September 2024 Bawat has seen a gradual ramp-up in activities, especially on BaaS. This also means the existing guiding principles being sales forecast are no longer ideal to measure performance as the new activities contribute with a far higher margin than pure sale of systems. Bawat has previously changed guiding principles from sales to EBITDA. On a comparable sales volume to H1 2024, the GP margin has increased from 13% to 43% which is higher than previously guided. July 2025 was the second consecutive month with a positive EBITDA. Consequently, Bawat is guiding for positive EBITDA for H2 2025 based on combination of current BaaS track record and backlog. The full year EBITDA for 2025 is expected to be in the range of SEK -9 to -6m, below earlier guidance indicating a positive EBITDA for the year. At the time of our listing in March 2022 our prospectus guided our investors towards EBITDA-breakeven Q4 2024. The company is two quarters late relative to our original guidance. However, business potential is broader and with significantly higher profitability than originally forecasted.

Reported revenue in Q2 2025 decreased to DKK 60.0m (Q2 2024: DKK 71.2m), corresponding to decrease of 16% (H1 2025: increase of 22% to DKK 129.7m), in relation to the company's goal of focusing on profitability.

Net working capital amounted to DKK 313.4m as of June 30, 2025 (DKK 87.6m as of June 30, 2024).

Published: 2025-08-28 16:30:13 CEST LR Health & Beauty SE - Inside information LR Health & Beauty SE: Potential breach of Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 - Management Board intends to enter into discussions with bondholders of the 2024/2028 bond ... Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Art. 17 of the Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation – MAR) LR Health & Beauty SE: Potential breach of Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 – Management Board intends to enter into discussions with bondholders of the 2024/2028 bond regarding a precautionary resolution on a waiver of compliance with the Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 and an amendment to the bond terms; adjustment of EBITDA guidance for the financial year 2025. Ahlen, 28 August 2025 – The Management Board of LR Health & Beauty SE (“LR” or the “Company”) resolved today to initiate precautionary negotiations with the holders of the 2024/2028 bond (ISIN: NO0013149658) concerning a proposal to amend the bond terms. The background to this decision is a potential breach by the Company of the covenant under Clause 13.2 of the bond terms, pursuant to which the Company must ensure that net debt in relation to EBITDA does not exceed the threshold of 4.50:1 as at 30 September 2025 (“Leverage Covenant”). Clause 13.2.1 (iii) of the bond terms provides that the Leverage Covenant decreases from 4.75:1 to 4.50:1 with effect from 1 July 2025. Based on the valuation and calculation information currently available, though still preliminary in nature, the Management Board assumes that compliance with the Leverage Covenant on the review date of 30 September 2025 is unlikely. This is due to EBITDA developing less favourably than expected, primarily attributable to increased or increasing costs in the areas of marketing and sales. The Management Board has therefore resolved to enter into precautionary negotiations with the bondholders regarding an amendment to the bond terms – in particular the Leverage Covenant – and, if necessary, to request their consent to a waiver of the Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025. Furthermore, the Management Board will in due course provide information on the further course of action concerning the nature and timing of any vote on an amendment to the bond terms. Furthermore, the Management Board of the Company is adjusting the guidance for the financial year 2025 published on 25 April 2025. With regard to sales (revenue from goods sold), the Management Board now expects a stable development compared with the previous year. Previously, stable to moderately increasing sales had been forecast. EBITDA for the 2025 financial year is now expected to range between EUR 24.0 million and EUR 27.0 million – whereas the previous guidance anticipated significant EBITDA growth compared with the prior-year figure of EUR 27.3 million. The revision of the guidance is essentially due to increased or increasing costs in the areas of marketing and sales. This trend also continued in July, leading the Management Board to conclude that the previous guidance is unlikely to be achieved through catch-up effects or cost-saving measures.

CEO Comment Dear Shareholders, As we close the second quarter of 2025, Done.ai continues to move in our fast-paced and disciplined build phase. This quarter has been marked by continued organic growth, active integration of our strategic acquisitions, and meaningful progress toward our long-term vision to build an AI-driven, one-stop-shop business platform. We are creating a unified ecosystem that seamlessly connects finance, CRM, marketing, operations, and intelligence, all designed to help businesses find, win, and grow customer relationships. Done.ai is not simply acquiring and aggregating, we are assembling a next-generation operational stack. And we are doing so with a clear goal: to deliver real customer value, strong cash flows, and long-term shareholder return. Growing Organically, Integrating Strategically Done.ai’s financial performance continues to strengthen. On a pro forma basis including all acquisitions completed to date, Done.ai delivered SEK 101 million in revenue in Q2, reflecting the current true scale of the operating group. The result for the period was impacted by a SEK 27 million closing balance sheet adjustment related to the divestment of the company’s ERP division at the end of 2024, which is non-recurring and not connected to the Group’s ongoing operations. Adjusted for this item, pro forma EBITDA amounted to SEK 5 million in Q2, without yet realizing the full synergies of the acquisitions. Reported group net sales were SEK 61 million in Q2, compared to SEK 8 million in Q2 2024 (excluding the divested ERP division), highlighting Done.ai’s strong underlying growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the group was a loss of SEK 3 million, as integration and platform investments continue. We are actively integrating the strategic acquisitions completed during H1 2025: • Frisikt, WeAssist, Accountabl, and Metamanager have added critical capabilities across accounting, CRM, spend management, and AI-powered SEO. • Debet, Fullstakk, and Jcloud, closed after Q2, have strengthened our customer base, cloud capability, and marketing capacity across the Nordics. • Also following quarter-end, we closed the final phase of the Huddlestock IaaS acquisition, bringing institutional-grade investment infrastructure fully under our ownership. The business will be rebranded to Done Investments. The result is a stronger and more capable platform company with a unified stack built for growth. The Done.ai Platform Takes Shape As part of our strategy, Done.ai is actively integrating our product portfolio into a unified, modular platform. Already today, customers can directly access multiple parts of the Done.ai ecosystem, whether CRM, marketing, HR, MRP or services. As we expand and continue our integration we are also rolling out the Done.ai platform which once completed will be the main home of our entire product suite. We are also rolling out shared group tools and infrastructure across our businesses, enabling everything from single-sign-on to embedded analytics, and working toward a full cross-sell go-to-market approach. Fintech Products Rollout in Motion A key pillar of Done.ai’s vision is to build a smarter, more integrated financial services experience for the SMB segment. During Q2, we made solid progress on our first fintech product, Deferred Payments, with beta launch expected in Q4. This product will allow end users to extend payment terms on invoices, improving liquidity and cash flow planning. The service is being developed in close partnership with 24SevenOffice and Nordiska. Done.ai has an exclusive distribution agreement of all its financial services offerings with 24SevenOffice to the end of 2028. The Deferred Payments product establishes the foundation for Done.ai’s broader embedded finance suite. With Accountabl, our UK-based spend management company, we are continuing to progress towards the launch of our Nordic spend management solution. Over time, the suite will expand to include: • Spend and card management solutions for greater control and efficiency • Working capital products, including SME lending and factoring • Treasury and FX services to simplify international transactions • Investment solutions tailored for SMEs We expect the Fintech division to become a meaningful revenue contributor from 2026 onwards. Building for Cash Flow and Long-Term Value Done.ai continue to operate with a clear focus on cash flow discipline and shareholder value creation. Our pro forma EBITDA remains positive, even as we absorb the cost of integration and platform investment. The group has over SEK 200 million in liquidity after all acquisitions made to date, providing us flexibility for future growth and further acquisitions. The strategic rationale behind our acquisitions is not simply revenue growth, it is margin expansion and recurring cash flow over time. As we integrate operations, consolidate back-office functions, and cross-sell services, we expect to unlock significant synergies in both gross margin and OPEX over the next 12–18 months. Exploring Modern Treasury Strategy Aligned with our product ambition, we are also modernizing our internal treasury approach. In response to growing SMB interest in crypto-enabled treasury tools, we initiated a NOK 20 million allocation to Bitcoin, backed by a regulated custody setup and clear policy framework. Our first purchases are imminent, and this move serves both strategic and exploratory purposes, helping us learn as we build future financial infrastructure. Stronger Foundations, Wider Reach In just six months, we’ve expanded to a customer base of over 10,000 businesses across the Nordics and internationally. Through our exclusive distribution agreement with 24SevenOffice, we also have direct access to an additional 30,000 ERP customers, significantly strengthening our go-to-market capacity. Our expanding international presence and M&A pipeline also position us well for continued disciplined growth through 2025 and 2026. With a strong balance sheet and continued shareholder backing, we retain flexibility to act with both speed and focus. Looking Ahead We are still in the early chapters of our journey. But the pieces are coming together. The platform is taking shape. The integration is accelerating. And the value creation is beginning to surface. Thank you for your continued trust. We are here to build something bold, something global, and something lasting and we’re just getting started.

Väsentliga händelser under andra kvartalet Den 16 april 2025 meddelades beslutet att utse Erik Lager till Chief Operating Officer (COO), för att fortsatt säkerställa kvalitén inom order, produktion och leverans under bolagets kommersiella expansion. Erik Lager har sedan 2019 varit Chief Technology Officer (CTO) i aXichem. Den 28 april 2025 meddelas att GLP-Activate™, som lanserades i april 2024 av Triquetra Health, nu är en av återförsäljarens ledande produkter och en viktig tillväxtmotor för aXichems kosttillskottsingrediens aXivite ® . Den 12 maj 2025 meddelade bolaget att man efter mycket framgångsrika tester vid en större produktionsanläggning i Brasilien, erhållit första avropet för aXiphen ® inom ramen för den order från distributören Chr. Olesen , om sammanlagt cirka 7 miljoner kronor, som bolaget tidigare kommunicerat. Värdet på avropsordern uppgår till cirka 1,5 miljoner kronor och har planerad leverans i kvartal två. Den 27 maj publicerades bolagets årsredovisning 2024. Årsstämma i aXichem hölls den 18 juni och kommuniké från årsstämman finns publicerad på bolagets hemsida. Den 12 juni 2025 meddelades att aXichem med positivt resultat genomfört de studier avseende effekt, som utgör en del av underlaget för komplettering till ansökan om Feed Additive-godkännande i EU, för phenylcapsaicin som salmonellahämmande tillsats i kycklingfoder. Bolaget sammanställer nu samtligt kompletterande material och kommer att lämna in de nya delarna i ansökan till European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) inom cirka en månad. Väsentliga händelser efter rapportperiodens slut Den 1 juli 2025 meddelar bolaget att man har lämnat in kompletterande information till EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) för godkännande av phenylcapsaicin som fodertillsats inom djurkategorin ”kycklingar för slakt”. Ansökan är inlämnad under kategorin zootekniska tillsatser, inom den funktionella gruppen ""andra zootekniska tillsatser"". Materialet bygger på evidens som visar phenylcapsaicins salmonellahämmande egenskaper. Den 21 augusti 2025 kommunicerade bolaget den första kommersiella ordern av aXiphen ® från en fjäderfäproducent I Brasilien. Ordern representerar en kommersiell och storskalig användning av cirka fyra ton aXiphen ® , och levereras från Chr. Olesens befintliga lager i Brasilien. Den beställda volymen motsvarar ungefär hälften av behovet för producentens månatliga produktion av broilers. Den 25 augusti 2025 kommunicerades att bolaget har lämnat in en patentansökan för phenylcapsaicin som fodertillsats för mjölkkor i syfte att öka mjölkproduktionen. Patentansökan omfattar metoder för användning och dosering av phenylcapsaicin i foder till mjölkkor och lämnas in mot bakgrund av lovande inledande resultat i ett explorativt fälttest som genomförts i Brasilien med aXiphen ® administrerat i fodret till mjölkkor av rasen Girolando . Den inlämnade patentansökan bekräftar aXichems kommunicerade patentstrategi, som syftar till att säkra kommersiellt intressanta immateriella rättigheter kopplad till phenylcapsaicin. VD har ordet Det är dags att summera det andra kvartalet 2025, som för aXichem inneburit viktiga steg i bolagets utveckling såväl kommersiellt som regulatoriskt. Vi noterar en nettoomsättning för kvartalet om 6 648 tkr, vilket ger oss en omsättning under första halvåret om 10 035 tkr, vilket är en betydande ökning jämfört med motsvarande period förra året. Liksom tidigare kommer intäkterna från försäljning av aXivite ® i Europa och i USA. Rörelseresultatet för andra kvartalet 2025 uppgår till -3 398 tkr och för halvåret -9 274 tkr. Studierna kopplade till Feed Additive-ansökan i EU är nu avslutade, och i andra kvartalet syns de sista kostnaderna för dessa. När det gäller bolagets likviditet har vi utöver kassan tillgång till den kreditfacilitet om fem miljoner kronor som upptogs i mars, vilket tidigare kommunicerats, och varav 3 089 tusen kronor använts vid periodens slut. Detta ger koncernen en total likviditet på 8 632 tusen kronor per den 30 juni 2025. aXivite fortsätter att leverera Inom kosttillskottsbranschen är det fortsatt stort fokus på tarmhälsa, viktkontroll och träning. Detta såg vi inte minst under vår närvaro på branschmässan Vitafoods i Barcelona den 20-22 maj. Eftersom aXivite ® har visat goda resultat i studier inom samtliga dessa segment ger det oss fina möjligheter att få uppmärksamhet för vår ingrediens. Ett spännande exempel på detta är GLP-Activate™, som lanserades i april 2024 av Triquetra Health. GLP-Activate™ är nu en av återförsäljarens ledande produkter inom viktkontroll, och under kvartalet har den bidragit starkt till vår försäljning. Efterfrågan i USA utvecklas positivt och i Europa har vi under kvartalet sett störst aktivitet i Spanien och Italien, med återkommande order från våra distributörer. Vi kan redan nu konstatera att 2025 blir aXivites bästa år så här långt. För er som vill veta mer om aXivite ® så rekommenderar jag att lyssna på intervjun med vår VP of Sales and Marketing, Lucas Altepost och vår affärsutvecklingsrådgivare i USA, Tim Avila, som gjordes av Västra Hamnen Corporate Finance i juni och som ni hittar på den här länken Kompletteringarna av Feed Additive-ansökan i EU inlämnade I juni kunde vi glädjande meddela att vi med positivt resultat genomfört de studier avseende effekt som återstod för att kunna sammanställa underlaget för komplettering till ansökan om Feed Additive-godkännande av vår produkt i EU. Efter periodens slut, den 1 juli, sändes den kompletterande information till EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) för godkännande av phenylcapsaicin som fodertillsats inom djurkategorin ”kycklingar för slakt” (eng. chickens for fattening) . Ansökan är inlämnad under kategorin zootekniska tillsatser, inom den funktionella gruppen ""andra zootekniska tillsatser"". Materialet visar på evidens avseende phenylcapsaicins salmonellahämmande egenskaper. Precis som tidigare går handläggningen att följa på EFAS hemsida, där det för närvarande anges 15 januari 2026 som deadline för den fas som benämns Risk Assessment för våra kompletteringar. aXichem kommer att hålla marknaden informerad om eventuella större förändringar i processen. Framgångsrika tester med aXiphen i Brasilien Vårt samarbete med Chr. Olesens team i Brasilien börjar visa konkreta resultat och i maj kunde vi berätta att tester, som genomförts vid en större produktionsanläggning i Brasilien, visat mycket positiva resultat. Därmed fick vi också det första avropet för aXiphen ® inom ramen för den order, om sammanlagt cirka 7 miljoner kronor, som Chr. Olesen placerade i början av året och som vi tidigare kommunicerat. Värdet på avropsordern uppgår till cirka 1,5 miljoner kronor. Leveransen flyttades av logistiska skäl hos kunden fram något, från andra till tredje kvartalet, och levereras i september. Efter periodens slut kunde vi, som en följd av de positiva testerna, glädjande berätta om den första kommersiella ordern för aXiphen ® från en kycklingproducent i Brasilien. Det är oerhört spännande att få återkoppling från den här typen av större kund och se vilken effekt vår produkt har i en köttproduktion av den här digniteten. Vi bygger nu en referensbank med solida success cases och fortsätter marknadsbearbetningen tillsammans med Chr. Olesen för att med aXiphen ® visa vägen till en hållbar, antibiotikafri kycklingproduktion i Brasilien, världens största exportör av kycklingkött. Efter periodens slut, den 25 augusti, kunde vi berätta att vi lämnat in en patentansökan för aXiphen ® som tillsats i foder för mjölkkor för ökad mjölkproduktion. aXiphen inkluderades i ett explorativt fälttest i Brasilien med Girolando-kor, initierat av en mejeriproducent, där 54 Girolando-kor fick 15 mg phenylcapsaicin/dag per ko (vilket motsvarar cirka 0,8 mg/kg torrsubstans för denna typ av nötkreatur) i sin foderblandning under en period av fem veckor. Detta tillskott resulterade i en genomsnittlig ökning av mjölkavkastningen på 2 liter per dag, vilket motsvarar en förbättring av produktiviteten med cirka 5 % hos den testade gruppen. Naturligt capsaicin har i studier visat sig ha en positiv inverkan på mjölkavkastningen hos mjölkkor, men i doser så höga som 80 till 400 mg capsaicin per ko per dag beroende på foderintag (Animals, Volym 14, Nummer 7, 2024), ). Administrering av högre doser av naturligt capsaicin kan potentiellt öka risken för gastrointestinal irritation och matsmältningsstörningar. Resultaten som visats i det explorativa testet med aXiphen ® i fodret till mjölkkor ser lovande ut och indikerar att phenylcapsaicin kan bli ett kostnadseffektivt alternativ, i en låg och säker dos, för att förbättra mjölkavkastningen i storskalig produktion. Vi fortsätter att fokusera på att lansera aXiphen ® på marknaden för fjäderfäfoder och att vara dedikerade till att utnyttja phenylcapsaicins fulla potential. Denna patentansökan är en del av vår strategi att säkra kommersiellt intressanta immateriella tillgångar kopplade till phenylcapsaicin och vara nyfikna på framtida möjligheter för vår produkt. Torsten Helsing, VD Om aXichem AB (publ) aXichems affärsidé är att utveckla, patentera och marknadsföra naturanaloga industriföreningar. aXichems produkt är en capsaicinanalog, phenylcapsaicin, som är ett syntetiskt framställt och patenterat capsaicin. Eftersom phenylcapsaicin är syntetiskt framställt har det ett antal fördelar jämfört med naturligt capsaicin, såsom en kontrollerbar kvalitet och produktionsprocess. Produkten har fördelar som gör den kommersiellt intressant inom flera användningsområden, till exempel som ingrediens i djurfoder, som ingrediens i kosttillskott, samt som bioförstärkare. aXichem marknadsför för närvarande produkten som ingrediens under olika varumärken inom två prioriterade områden: aXivite ® för kosttillskott och aXiphen ® för fjäderfä- och svinfoder. aXiphen ® har visat egenskaper som tillväxtfrämjare och antisalmonellaingrediens i studier gjorda i kommersiella miljöer för fjäderfäproduktion. Inom marknadssegmentet kosttillskott ingår aXivite ® idag i flera produkter för viktkontroll, förbättrad ämnesomsättning, tarmhälsa samt sport och träning. aXichem har som mål att bli en global leverantör av industriella naturliga analoga kemikalier till aktörer inom den kemiska industrin, som tillverkar produkter som innehåller aXichems råvaror. Bolagets aktie är noterad på NASDAQ First North sedan 2013. Framtidsutsikter aXichem fortsätter arbetet med kommersialiseringen av phenylcapsaicin under varumärkena aXiphen®, som tillsats i fjäderfäfoder respektive svinfoder med möjlighet att kunna förebygga salmonella, samt aXivite®, som hälsofrämjande ingrediens i kosttillskott. Inom affärsområdet kosttillskott har bolaget sedan 2018 godkännande för marknadsföring och försäljning av phenylcapsaicin enligt GRAS food i USA och sedan 2019 godkännande enligt Novel Food för marknadsföring och försäljning inom EU. Bolaget arbetar aktivt med försäljning av aXivite ® på dessa båda marknader och förväntar sig en successivt ökande försäljning inom områdena tarmhälsa, träning och viktkontroll. aXivite som förstärkare av biotillgänglighet visade under 2024 ökad försäljning genom en slutprodukt från spanska läkemedelsbolaget Uriach. Inom affärsområde djurfoder fick bolaget sitt första Feed Additive-godkännande i december 2023. Phenylcapsaicin är därmed godkänt i Brasilien för marknadsföringoch försäljning som tillsats i fjäderfäfoder respektive svinfoder. Lansering skedde under 2024 i samarbete med distributören Chr. Olesens team i Brasilien, vilket resulterade i en order om 7 MSEK efter årets slut, i februari 2025 och bolaget fick första avropsordern i maj 2025. I början av 2022 lämnade aXichem in ansökan om Feed Additive-godkännande inom EU för phenylcapsaicin som tillsats i kycklingfoder. Bolaget uppmanades i slutet av 2023 att komplettera vissa data i ansökan. Under 2024-2025 har aXichem genomfört de studier som krävs för att fylla datagapen och kompletteringarna lämnades till EU 1 juli 2025. Ansökningar om marknadsgodkännande för användning av phenylcapsaicin i djurfoder i USA respektive Indien är förberedda. Dock har bolaget valt att för aXiphen ® prioritera etableringen i Brasilien respektive godkännande i EU, samt för aXivite ® fortsatt kommersialisering i USA och EU. Bolaget bedömer att man under de kommande åren kommer att se en successivt ökande orderingång inom såväl djurfoder som kosttillskott. Finansiering Den 1 februari 2024 meddelades att bolagets styrelse, förutsatt bolagsstämmans godkännande, beslutat att genomföra en emission av aktier och teckningsoptioner (”Units”), med företrädesrätt för befintliga aktieägare, om cirka 40,3 MSEK före emissionskostnader (”Företrädesemissionen”). Styrelsen beslutade vidare att uppta ett nytt konvertibellån från Formue Nord Fokus A/S om cirka 5,3 MSEK som delvis ersatte befintligt konvertibellån. Utfallet av företrädesemissionen, som tecknades till 70 procent, meddelades den 26 mars 2024. Genom företrädesemissionen tillfördes aXichem cirka 28,2 MSEK före emissionskostnader. Under perioden 1–7 oktober genomfördes nyttjande av teckningsoptioner av serie TO1A till en kurs om 0,95 SEK. Därtill genomfördes en riktad nyemission av 946 437 A-aktier, till de investerare som lämnat så kallad toppgaranti i samband med nyttjandeperioden avseende teckningsoptionerna av serie TO1A. Det innebar att bolaget tillfördes 17,9 MSEK före transaktionskostnader och att antalet aktier ökade med 18 809 290, från 40 305 615 till 59 114 905, samt att aktiekapitalet ökade med ytterligare 3 761 858 SEK, från 8 061 123 SEK till 11 822 981 SEK. I samband med nyttjandet av teckningsoptionerna återbetalade aXichem konvertibellånet till Formue Nord Fokus A/S i sin helhet. I mars 2025 meddelade bolaget att man upptagit en kreditfacilitet om fem miljoner kronor med stöd av Europeiska Investeringsfonden (EIF). Incitamentsprogram – Personaloptioner Vid årsstämman 31 maj 2022 beslutades om ett optionsprogram av serie 2022/2026 till anställda och nyckelpersoner i bolaget omfattande 400 000 optioner med rätt till teckning av 400 000 A-aktier. Per balansdagen var 270 000 optioner tilldelade personal och nyckelpersoner, varav 33 750 var intjänade. Personaloptionerna tjänas in under 4 år, med en fjärdedel respektive år, förutsatt att deltagaren är anställd i eller på annat sätt engagerad i bolaget på tilldelningsdagen. Personaloptionerna tilldelas vederlagsfritt. Intjänade personaloptioner kan nyttjas under en treårsperiod, dock inte tidigare än tre år efter respektive tilldelningsdag. Varje personaloption ger rätt att teckna 1 A-aktie till en teckningskurs som motsvarar 140 procent av den volymvägda genomsnittskursen för bolagets A-aktie under de fem handelsdagar som närmast föregår den dag då personaloptionerna tilldelas. Teckningskursen och det antal A-aktier som varje personaloption berättigar till kan bli föremål för omräkning till följd av fondemission, split, emissioner eller liknande åtgärder. För att möjliggöra leverans av aktier enligt incitamentsprogrammet beslöts även om utgivande av högst 400 000 teckningsoptioner.

Significant events during the period On April 16, 2025, it was announced the company had decided to appoint Erik Lager as Chief Operating Officer (COO), to continue to ensure quality in orders, production and delivery during the company's commercial expansion. Erik Lager has been Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at aXichem since 2019. On April 28, 2025, it was announced that GLP-Activate™, which was launched in April 2024 by Triquetra Health, is now one of the retailer's leading products and a key growth driver for aXichem's dietary supplement ingredient aXivite ® . On May 12, 2025, the company announced that after very successful tests at a major production facility in Brazil, it had received the first call-off for aXiphen® within the framework of the order from distributor Chr. Olesen, totalling approximately SEK 7 million, which the company had previously communicated. The value of the call-off order amounts to approximately SEK 1.5 million and is scheduled for delivery in the second quarter. On May 27, 2025, the company's annual report 2024 was published. The annual general meeting of aXichem was held on June 18 and a communiqué from the annual general meeting is published on the company's website. On June 12, 2025, it was announced that aXichem had successfully completed the efficacy studies that form part of the basis for supplementing the application for Feed Additive approval in the EU for phenylcapsaicin as a salmonella-inhibiting additive in chicken feed. The company is now compiling all supplementary material and will submit the new parts of the application to the European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) within approximately one month. Significant events after the end of the reporting period On July 1, 2025, the company announces that it has submitted supplementary information to EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) for the approval of phenylcapsaicin as a feed additive in the animal category ""chickens for slaughter"". The application is submitted under the category of zootechnical additives, within the functional group ""other zootechnical additives"". The material is based on evidence showing phenylcapsaicin's salmonella-inhibiting properties. On August 21, 2025, the company announced the first commercial order for aXiphen ® from a poultry producer in Brazil. The order represents a commercial and large-scale use of approximately four tons of aXiphen ® and is being delivered from Chr. Olesen's existing warehouse in Brazil. The volume corresponds to approximately half of the producer's demand for a monthly production of broilers. On August 25, 2025, it was announced that the company has filed a patent application for phenylcapsaicin as a feed additive for dairy cows with the aim of increasing milk production. The patent application covers methods for the use and dosage of phenylcapsaicin in feed for dairy cows and is filed considering promising initial results in an exploratory field trial conducted in Brazil with aXiphen ® administered in the feed of Girolando dairy cows. The filed patent application confirms aXichem's communicated patent strategy, which aims to secure commercially interesting intellectual property rights related to phenylcapsaicin. CEO’s statement It is time to summarize the second quarter of 2025, which for aXichem has meant important steps in the company's development, both commercially and in our regulatory work. We note a net turnover for the quarter of 6,648 thousand SEK, which gives us a turnover for the first half of 10,035 thousand SEK, which is a significant increase compared to the corresponding period last year. As before, revenue comes from sales of aXivite ® in Europe and the USA. The operating profit for the second quarter of 2025 amounts to -3,398 thousand SEK and for the half of -9 274 thousand SEK. The studies linked to the Feed Additive application in the EU are now completed, and the final costs for these are visible in the second quarter. In terms of the company's liquidity, in addition to cash, we have access to the credit facility of five million SEK, which, as previously announced was raised in March , out of which 3,089 thousand SEK had been used at the end of the period. This gives the Group a total liquidity of 8,632 thousand SEK as of June 30, 2025. aXivite ® continues to perform In the dietary supplement industry, there is continued great focus on intestinal health, weight control and exercise. We saw this not least during our presence at the Vitafoods trade fair in Barcelona on May 20-22. Since aXivite has shown good results in studies in all these segments, it gives us great opportunities to get attention for our ingredient. An exciting example of this is GLP-Activate™, which was launched in April 2024 by Triquetra Health. GLP-Activate™ is now one of the retailer's leading products in weight management, and during the quarter it has contributed strongly to our sales. Demand in the US is developing positively and in Europe we have seen the greatest activity in Spain and Italy during the quarter, with recurring orders from our distributors. We can already say that 2025 will be aXivite's best year so far. For those of you who want to know more about aXivite ® , I recommend listening to the interview with our VP of Sales and Marketing, Lucas Altepost, and our business development advisor in the US, Tim Avila, which was conducted by Västra Hamnen Corporate Finance in June and which you can find at this link Supplements to the Feed Additive application in the EU submitted In June, we were pleased to announce that we had successfully completed the remaining efficacy studies to compile the basis for the supplement to the application for Feed Additive approval of our product in the EU. After the end of the period, on July 1, the supplemental information was sent to EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) for approval of phenylcapsaicin as a feed additive in the animal category “chickens for fattening”. The application has been submitted under the category of zootechnical additives, within the functional group “other zootechnical additives”. The material shows evidence of phenylcapsaicin’s salmonella-inhibiting properties. Just as before, the processing can be followed on the EFAS website, where the deadline for the phase called Risk Assessment for our supplements is currently 15 January 2026. aXichem will keep the market informed of any major changes in the process. Successful tests with aXiphen in Brazil Our collaboration with Chr. Olesen's team in Brazil is starting to show concrete results and in May we were able to report that tests carried out at a larger production facility in Brazil had shown very positive results. This also meant that we received the first call-off for aXiphen ® within the framework of the order, totalling approximately SEK 7 million, that Chr. Olesen placed at the beginning of the year and which we had previously communicated. The value of the call-off order amounts to approximately SEK 1.5 million. For logistical reasons, the delivery was moved from the second to the third quarter at the customer's and will be delivered in September. After the end of the period, as a result of the positive tests, we were pleased to announce the first commercial order for aXiphen ® from a chicken producer in Brazil. It is extremely exciting to receive feedback from this type of major customer and to see what effect our product has in a meat production of this magnitude. We are now building a reference bank with solid success cases and continuing the market development together with Chr. Olesen to use aXiphen ® to show the way to sustainable, antibiotic-free chicken production in Brazil, the world's largest exporter of chicken meat. After the end of the period, on August 25, we were able to announce that we had filed a patent application for aXiphen ® as a feed additive for dairy cows to increase milk production. aXiphen ® was included in an exploratory field trial in Brazil with Girolando cows, initiated by a dairy producer, where 54 Girolando cows received 15 mg phenylcapsaicin/day per cow (corresponding to approximately 0.8 mg/kg dry matter for this type of cattle) in their feed mixture for a period of five weeks. This supplementation resulted in an average increase in milk yield of 2 liters per day, which corresponds to an improvement in productivity of approximately 5% in the tested group. Natural capsaicin has been shown in studies to have a positive impact on milk yield in dairy cows, but at doses as high as 80 to 400 mg capsaicin per cow per day depending on feed intake (Animals, Volume 14, Number 7, 2024), ). Administration of higher doses of natural capsaicin may potentially increase the risk of gastrointestinal irritation and digestive disorders. The results shown in the exploratory test with aXiphen in the feed of dairy cows look promising and indicate that phenylcapsaicin can be a cost-effective alternative, at a low and safe dose, to improve milk yield in large-scale production. We continue to focus on launching aXiphen ® in the poultry feed market and are dedicated to exploiting the full potential of phenylcapsaicin. This patent application is part of our strategy to secure commercially interesting intellectual property assets related to phenylcapsaicin and be curious about future opportunities for our product. Torsten Helsing, CEO About aXichem AB (publ) aXichem's business concept is to develop, patent and market natural-analogue industrial compounds. aXichem's product is a natural analog substance called phenylcapsaicin, which is a synthetically produced and patented capsaicin. As phenylcapsaicin is synthetically produced and has several advantages compared to natural capsaicin, such as controllable quality and production process. The product has benefits that makes it commercially interesting in several application areas, for example as ingredient in animal feed, as ingredient in dietary supplements, as a bio-enhancer and as a bio-repellent in marine applications. aXichem is currently marketing the product under different brands in two prioritized areas: aXivite ® for dietary supplements and aXiphen ® for poultry feed. aXiphen ® has shown properties as a growth promoter and anti-salmonella additive in studies made in commercial poultry production settings. In the market segment for sports nutrition products aXivite ® is today included in several products for weight control, improved metabolism, and gut health. aXichem aims to become a global supplier of industrial natural analogue chemicals to players in the chemical industry who manufacture products containing aXichem's raw materials. The company’s share is listed on NASDAQ First North since 2013. Future prospects aXichem continues its work on the commercialization of phenylcapsaicin under the brands aXiphen ® , as an additive in poultry feed and pig feed with the potential to prevent salmonella, and aXivite ® , as a health-promoting ingredient in dietary supplements. In the dietary supplements business area, the company has had approval for the marketing and sale of phenylcapsaicin under GRAS food in the USA since 2018 and approval under Novel Food for marketing and sale in the EU since 2019. The company is actively working on the sale of aXivite in both markets and expects a gradual increase in sales in the areas of intestinal health, exercise and weight control. aXivite as a bioavailability enhancer showed increased sales in 2024 through a consumer product from the Spanish pharmaceutical company Uriach. In the animal feed business area, the company received its first Feed Additive approval in December 2023. Phenylcapsaicin is thus approved in Brazil for marketing and sale as an additive in poultry feed and pig feed, respectively. The launch took place in 2024 in collaboration with the distributor Chr. Olesen's team in Brazil, which resulted in an order of SEK 7 million after the end of the year, in February 2025, and the company received its first call-off order in May 2025. In early 2022, aXichem submitted an application for Feed Additive approval in the EU for phenylcapsaicin as an additive in chicken feed. The company was asked at the end of 2023 to supplement certain data in the application. During 2024-2025, aXichem has conducted the studies required to fill the data gaps and the supplements were submitted to the EU on July 1, 2025. Applications for market approval for the use of phenylcapsaicin in animal feed in the USA and India are prepared. However, the company has chosen to prioritize the establishment in Brazil and approval in the EU for aXiphen ® , respectively, and continued commercialization in the USA and EU for aXivite ® . The company estimates that in the coming years it will see a gradual increase in order intake in both animal feed and dietary supplements. Financing On February 1, 2024, it was announced that the company's board of directors, subject to the approval of the general meeting, had decided to carry out an issue of shares and warrants (“Units”), with preferential rights for existing shareholders, of approximately SEK 40.3 million before issue costs (the “Preference Issue”). The board further decided to raise a new convertible loan from Formue Nord Fokus A/S of approximately SEK 5.3 million, which partially replaced the existing convertible loan. The outcome of the preference issue, which was subscribed to at 70 percent, was announced on March 26, 2024. Through the preference issue, aXichem received approximately SEK 28.2 million before issue costs. During the period October 1–7, the exercise of series TO1A warrants was carried out at a price of SEK 0.95. In addition, a directed new issue of 946,437 A shares was carried out to investors who had provided a so-called top guarantee in connection with the exercise period for the TO1A series subscription options. This meant that the company was provided with MSEK 17,9 before transaction costs and that the number of shares increased by 18,809,290, from 40,305,615 to 59,114,905, and that the share capital increased by a further SEK 3,761,858, from SEK 8,061,123 to SEK 11,822,981. In connection with the exercise of the subscription options, aXichem repaid the convertible loan to Formue Nord Fokus A/S in full. In March 2025, the company announced that it had taken out a credit facility of SEK five million with support from the European Investment Fund (EIF). Incentive program – Employee stock options At the annual general meeting on May 31, 2022, it was decided on an option program of series 2022/2026 for employees and key persons in the company comprising 400,000 options with the right to subscribe for 400,000 A shares. As of the balance sheet date, 270,000 options were allocated to staff and key persons, of which 101,250 were vested. The employee options are earned over 4 years, with a quarter each year, provided that the participant is employed by or otherwise engaged in the company on the grant date. The staff options are awarded free of charge. Earned employee options can be exercised during a three-year period, however no earlier than three years after the respective grant date. Each employee option gives the right to subscribe for 1 A share at a subscription price that corresponds to 140 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the company's A share during the five trading days immediately preceding the day on which the employee options are awarded. The subscription price and the number of A shares to which each employee option entitles may be subject to recalculation as a result of a bonus issue, split, issues or similar measures. In order to enable the delivery of shares according to the incentive program, it was also decided to issue a maximum of 400,000 warrants.

Published: 2025-08-28 08:00:00 CEST Avida Finans AB - Interim report (Q1 and Q3) Avida Finans AB publishes Interim report for the period January-June 2025. Key Steps Toward an Efficient and Profitable Business, but Hard Work Remains. The transformation of Avida into an efficient, modern and profitable company continued during the second quarter of the year with a focus on cost savings and a strengthened balance sheet. “The cost savings program with the goal of reducing costs by 200 million SEK is proceeding according to plan,” says Mikael Johansson , CEO of Avida. “As part of the savings plans, we carried out an efficiency improvement of the organization, as we completed workforce reductions of approximately 30% during the first half of the year. This has led to expected one-off costs of 11 million SEK.” The work to digitalize and improve the efficiency of Avida’s IT systems has continued, with the goal of having the best technical conditions for a scalable and cost-efficient business going forward. “During the quarter, write-downs of old IT systems of approximately 33 million SEK were made,” says Mikael Johansson. “At the same time, the migration of the acquired credit card and sales financing business from Santander is the most important project being carried out this year, and the goal remains to complete it before the end of the year.” Credit losses amounted to 276 million SEK during the quarter, including a one-off credit provision of 100 million SEK for all stages within the consumer loan portfolio. Avida has also signed an agreement on Significant Risk Transfer amounting to approximately 2 800 million SEK, with an estimated reduction of risk-weighted assets of approximately 1 800 million SEK. “With a stronger balance sheet, an adjusted cost level, a fit-for-purpose organization, and a customer-adapted offering, Avida will be ready for the next step in the transformation journey. But there is no shortage of challenges,” concludes Mikael Johansson. Second quarter 2025 (compared to second quarter 2024) Lending to the public amounted to 10,762.8 MSEK (10,445.5 MSEK). Net interest income amounted to 339.1 MSEK (187.0 MSEK). Credit losses amounted to 276.3 MSEK (124.8 MSEK). Operating profit was -138.2 MSEK (-55.8 MSEK). C/I ratio 0.61 (0.64). CET 1 ratio 13.50% (11.70%). Return on equity negative (negative). January-June 2025 (compared to January-June 2024) Lending to the public amounted to 10,762.8 MSEK (10,445.5 MSEK). Net interest income amounted to 663.9 MSEK (359.7 MSEK). Credit losses amounted to 482.5 MSEK (256.5 MSEK). Operating profit amounted to -195.8 MSEK (-124.0 MSEK). C/I ratio 0.58 (0.64).

The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact persons set out above, at 7.45 am CET on August 28, 2025. CEO’s Review Q2 saw a solid quarter of delivery in line with expectations, finishing off the quarter with three launches to add to four in Q1 2025, taking the total launched in 2025 so far to seven launches, with a solid pipeline of launches to come during Q3 2025 and beyond. I am particularly excited to see the launch of our first operator in the Philippines, which is fast becoming a key focal market for us. There is significant potential to be realised from the opportunities within this region, and I anticipate both our partner and the market in general to deliver significant revenue upside in the near to mid-term. Indeed, we see increasing potential not just in the APAC region but in the broader emerging markets, including LatAm, Eastern Europe and Africa, where iGaming regulation is evolving and creating substantial expansion opportunities for GiG. In these markets we intend to enter into larger, more strategic agreements with our partners, delivering a higher return on investment. This strategy also aligns with increased investor interest from emerging markets as demonstrated by the €4.7 million directed equity issue completed in June, which has strengthened our balance sheet and will allow us to act swiftly on strategic investments and business opportunities in line with our growth strategy whilst adding new investors to our shareholder base. Following the end of the quarter, we announced that an additional subscription undertaking had been received for a total consideration of approximately €22 million. This will allow us to capitalise even further upon new market opportunities whilst adding additional support to our balance sheet enabling us to accelerate plans to execute on our business strategy. I am delighted that following the end of the quarter, we have entered into a Heads of Terms to migrate a European Lottery’s online casino vertical onto GiG’s iGaming platform in H1-26. This is a significant milestone as not only does it represent the first Lottery win for the business, but it will also open up additional opportunities in this sector in the future and demonstrates further evidence that our technology is suited to both Tier 1 partners and market leaders in their respective regions. Whilst I am pleased that we have launched seven partners during the first half of this year, this is not where we would have aspired to have been at this point of the year, reflecting current market dynamics. Our focus has been very much on ensuring quality delivery and partnering with the right customers; however, this has meant that the launch cadence has not been realised at the speed that we had anticipated. To expand upon this further, the market sentiment and regulatory developments surrounding Sweepstakes in the US has had a negative impact, meaning that some partners have adopted more caution in entering this market. This, coupled with regulatory and market readiness delays for some of our partners, has contributed to the postponement of certain launches during the period. Once again, our cost control focus has delivered a sharp increase in both adjusted EBITDA and EBIT of €2.1 million and €2.9 million respectively, with GiG’s adjusted EBITDA achieving €1.0 million for the quarter. This is a testament to the scalability of our business model, and we are beginning to realise the potential for margin generation within our operations. Q2 saw another quarter of pipeline conversions, with three new commercial agreements signed alongside four new managed services agreements once again showcasing GiG’s ability to win new contracts amongst a backdrop of delivering a market-leading product to our existing partners. We are maintaining investment in both our product and sales execution to ensure that both our product and pipeline remain robust, and we continue to supply our partners with the very best in iGaming services and technology whilst attracting new, quality customers to our platform. The additional capital made available through the shareholder undertakings will support these initiatives and provide us with additional fuel for growth. In the light of all these developments, we have reassessed our guidance for 2025 accordingly, and have also provided guidance for 2026 revenue and EBITDA. With our focus on key new markets that are delivering significant mid-term growth, alongside our strengthened balance sheet and corresponding ability to strategically target high quality, experienced partners, I am happy that we can now share our growth targets for the mid-term, as set out in our aforementioned guidance. Overall, I am pleased with our progress in H1 2025 and am excited about what the future holds. Our strengthened financial position will enable us to make necessary investments in product development and new market opportunities which will position GiG for sustainable, long-term profitable growth; the future has never been brighter.

Management expects the challenging market conditions affecting the furniture industry will continue as a result of continued geopolitical risks as well as uncertainty about tariffs, inflation, currencies and interest rate trends. However, the continuing operations have continued to deliver growth in revenue and profit, and the management expects that this trend will continue. However, uncertainty continues to surround these expectations as a result of the above-mentioned market risks.

We are also seeing steady progress in our Healthcare segment, where RTX products remain critical components in advanced patient monitoring systems. Although short order cycles continue to limit forecast visibility, demand patterns across quarters are becoming more stable. We are increasing our efforts to follow ongoing market dynamics and trends, in order to better align with customer expectations and evolving market demands. At the end of June, we raised our full-year guidance, as strong Q3 result became evident and several orders for Q4 were secured. U.S. tariffs continue to create uncertainty, and we are working closely with our large international customers to find the best solutions. With strong expertise and a global customer base, the Company has a solid foundation. By expanding our footprint and focusing on strategic priorities, we are reinforcing our ability to drive sustainable growth and long-term value .” Henrik Mørck Mogensen, CEO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue for Q3 2024/25 increased by 3.5% year on year to 146.9 DKKm, compared to 141.9 DKKm in Q3 2023/24. Adjusted for currency effects, revenue for the quarter increased by 9.9%. For the first nine months of 2024/25, revenue rose by 16.7% year on year to 407.3 DKKm, and by 18.0% when adjusted for currency effects. Gross margin reached 51.7% for Q3 2024/25, and 50.7% for the first 9M 2024/25. Gross margin improved due to a favourable product mix and higher revenue from the Healthcare segment. EBITDA reached 15.0 DKKm for Q3 2024/25, and 22.2 DKKm for 9M 2024/25 (Q3 2023/24: 9.4 DKKm, 9M: -20.1 DKKm). GUIDANCE On 23 June 2025, RTX adjusted the guidance for 2024/25, and with the announcement of this interim report the intervals are narrowed by raising the lower range of EBITDA and EBIT by 10 DKKm: Revenue DKK 530 to 560 million (from DKK 490 to 530 million) EBITDA DKK 25 to 35 million (from DKK 0 to 20 million) EBIT DKK -5 to 5 million (from DKK -35 to -15 million) BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Continued strong performance in Enterprise segment driven mainly by customers in the retail sector and long-term customers demand across applications. The Healthcare segment delivered solid revenue growth, driven by sales of RTX products used in patient monitoring systems. While the order horizon remains short and creates uncertainty in our forecast, we see more stable and even demand patterns between quarters. Reduction in inventory from 74.1 DKKm in Q2 to 56.5 DKKm in Q3, mainly due to reduction in component inventory. Increase in guidance for the financial year 2024/25 was communicated on 23 June 2025.

The training business operations sold in the first half of 2024 and the subsidiary Wetteri Power Oy, sold at the beginning of 2025, are presented as discontinued operations in the interim report. Correspondingly, the income statement items of the discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated income statement for the financial year as part of the profit (loss) of the Group’s discontinued operations, separately from the income statement items of the Group’s continuing operations. 2 The adjusted EBITDA and operating profit do not take items affecting the comparability of the Group’s EBITDA and operating profit into account, such as significant non-recurring items of income and expenses, and amortisation of the fair value of assets recognised on the balance sheet by means of acquisition calculations. The purpose of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is to improve the comparability of the Group’s EBITDA and operating profit between periods. The reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is presented on page 18 of the interim report. CEO Pietu Parikka’s review “The car market continued to be challenging in the second quarter of 2025. During April–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s con-tinuing operations were EUR 109.0 million (117.3 million), adjusted EBITDA was EUR 2.3 million (2.8 million), and the adjust-ed operating profit was a loss of EUR -1.4 million (-0.7 million). Wetteri’s revenue of continuing operations for January–June was EUR 224.5 (244.1) million, its adjusted EBITDA was EUR 4.6 (6.7) million, and its adjusted operating result was EUR -2.8 (0.1) million. The loss for the period before taxes for continuing operations was EUR -8.8 (-8.3) million. Profitability was bur-dened by subdued market demand and the resulting price competition, low sales efficiency and weak working capital turno-ver. In January–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s Passenger Cars segment decreased by 13% year-on-year and amounted to EUR 162.5 million. The adjusted operating profit of the Passenger Cars segment showed a loss, amounting to EUR -4.1 million. The number of new car orders during January-June was 2,100 units, which is 11.7 percent more than in the corresponding period of the previous year. An increase in order volumes was seen toward the end of the review period. In January–June, Wetteri’s invoiced sales of new cars totalled 1,989 (1,994) units, which was in line with the previous year’s figures. Order and invoicing volumes were influenced, among other things, by new car brand representations. In line with our strategy, we ex-panded our operations in early 2025 by opening a new full-service dealership in Lahti, featuring brand representation for Kia, Mitsubishi and Mazda. After the review period, we also announced the launch of Mercedes-Benz representation in Lahti, start-ing in August 2025. The new market area and strong brands provide a solid foundation for increasing sales potential in the Päijät-Häme economic region. Competition in the used car trade remained intense, while demand was subdued, which was reflected in car prices and slow inventory turnover. During the six-month reporting period, 4,200 (4,965) used cars were sold, and their invoicing decreased by 15.4% year-on-year. The inventory optimisation measures initiated in the first quarter continued into the second quarter, including efforts to improve working capital turnover. The impacts of these measures are expected to materialise during the second half of 2025, providing a strong foundation for a turnaround in the profitability of the used car business. Towards the end of the first half of the year, we began to see positive signs in the unit profitability of sold vehicles and in the development of sales of the Wetteri Turva additional service. The weak performance in car sales also had an impact on maintenance and repair shop operations. The revenue of the Maintenance Services segment in January–June was EUR 46.2 (49.3) million, and its adjusted operating profit was EUR 1.0 (2.4) million. The number of damage repairs decreased as a result of the mild winter. Due to the uneven distribution of demand, there were significant differences in profitability between locations. For example, the maintenance and damage repair workshops at our new locations in Lempäälä and Lahti were still in the start-up phase during the review period. Performance improvement measures will be planned for low-profitability locations during the remainder of the year. The revenue of the Heavy Equipment segment developed favourably during the review period and amounted to EUR 14.1 (7.1) million. During the review period, we discontinued the importing of SANY earth-moving machinery. In May, we launched a profitability program aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and unit margins, improving working capital turnover, and reducing capital tied up in operations as well as indebtedness. The measures will be fully reflected in the results during 2026. Wetteri’s financial position already improved in January–June 2025 thanks to the Wetteri Power transaction and profitability measures: interest-bearing debt decreased by a total of EUR 24.8 million, and our equity ratio improved to 20 percent. During the review period, we made preparations for the sale of our heavy equipment maintenance and spare parts operations in Joensuu and Kajaani. The transaction was signed on 7 July 2025 and will be completed during the second half of 2025. The transaction further strengthens Wetteri’s self-sufficiency and creates a foundation for further business development. I started as the CEO of Wetteri at the beginning of August, after which we also renewed the composition of the management team. In the current challenging market situation, we continue to improve profitability and focus on enhancing efficiency. The strategy update process is also progressing, and we will publish our updated strategy in the second half of 2025. Due to the company’s financial situation and weaker-than-expected market development, we initiated change negotiations on 27 August 2025. The negotiations concern the personnel of Wetteri Yhtiöt Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, excluding mechanics. The aim is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the goal is to harmonize job descriptions and align organizational structures. If implemented, the measures may result in certain positions being discontinued or reorganized. Towards the end of the review period, cautious signs of a pick-up in car sales began to emerge in the market. The used car market is stabilising, and the prices of used cars are beginning to level out. The sales of new cars also appear to be developing positively toward the end of the year, with an increase in demand for electric cars. Affordable new electric vehicle models are entering the market, lowering the average price of new cars and thereby reducing the threshold for customers to purchase a new car. We also believe that the new scrapping bonus campaign presented by the government will support the development of the market. During the remainder of the year, we will continue measures to achieve synergy benefits from acquisitions and improve profitability. Wetteri holds significant potential, and by harnessing this potential, we can take major steps forward in our development. By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025. Registrations of new cars fell short of the levels projected by the automotive forecasting group. Based on the growth outlook for the automotive sector, an increase of around 10% was projected for 2025 at the end of 2024. However, in January–June 2025, registrations of new passenger cars were 4.9% lower than in the corresponding period in the previous year. In the used car trade, the unit price level has been low, but the market is now stabilising and showing signs of percentage growth. In April, Wetteri launched a profitability programme aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability. The full impact of the programme is expected to materialise during 2026. In August 2025, the company initiated change negotiations due to its financial situation and weaker-than-expected market demand. The objective of the negotiations is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of EUR 4 million. In May, Wetteri withdrew its guidance for 2025 due to increased market uncertainty. The company will review the possibility of issuing new guidance once the strategy work has been completed.

Revenue rose by 17% compared to the same quarter last year, reaching EUR 622 million, while gross profit grew by 17% to EUR 143 million. This development was supported by double-digit growth in both air and ocean freight, as well as continued contributions from our strategic acquisitions in Brazil, Italy, and most recently Canada. In the first half of 2025, revenue increased by 24% to EUR 1,263 million, while gross profit grew by 16% to EUR 275 million. EBITDA before special items reached EUR 94 million – up 13% – driven by higher volumes and effective utilisation of our network, although higher costs for integration and capacity building affected the conversion ratio. Our commercial momentum, especially in EMEA and Asia, confirms the value of local execution and close customer engagement. However, it is important to note that Q2 was significantly impacted by front-loading of volumes, particularly related to the US tariff situation. This has inflated activity levels in the quarter, while underlying year-to-date airfreight development remains negative.” Selected key figures and ratios EURm Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 Revenue 622 532 1,263 1,022 Gross profit 143 122 275 238 EBITDA before special items 51 43 94 83 Operating cash flow for the period (10) (13) (8) (71) Gross margin (%) 23.0 22.9 21.8 23.3 Conversion ratio (%) 35.7 35 .2 34.2 34.9 Revenue - The revenue in Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 622m an increase of 17% compared to EUR 532m in Q2 2024, primarily driven by organic activity in Asia and EMEA and our recent acquisitions. H1 2025 revenue amounted to EUR 1,263m an increase of 24% compared to EUR 1,022m in H1 2024 mainly impacted by the continued growth in Air & Ocean in Asia, especially China and Hong Kong, and network effect from investments in Italy and Brazil.

Gross profit - The gross profit Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 143m, an increase of 17% compared to EUR 122m in Q2 2024, primarily due to front-loading of shipments and inventory stocking coming from the US tariffs situation. The gross profit in H1 2025 amounted to EUR 275m, an increase of 16% compared to EUR 238m in H1 2024, particularly driven by last year's acquisitions in Brazil and Italy, partly supported by ITN combined with double-digit growth in Air & Ocean volumes.

Conversion ratio - The conversion ratio has increased by 0.5%-points in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The conversion ratio has decreased by 0.7%-points in H1 2025 compared to H1 2024 deriving from higher SG&A costs. Cash flow from operating activities - Cash flow from operating activities improved with EUR 3m in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The cash flow from operating activities in H1 2025 improved with EUR 63m compared to H1 2024, primarily impacted by the increase in NWC in Q1 2024 and a more muted NWC development in 2025. 2025 Outlook - In the first half of 2025, we delivered a stable performance with growth in Air & Ocean volumes, increasing our EBITDA before special items compared to the first half of 2024. However, we have been highly impacted by the geopolitical turmoil impacting the global freight market, especially around the Red Sea and the US tariff situation. Besides these factors impacting on our outlook, we also operate in a historically competitive market environment shaped by the increased level of consolidation in the industry, resulting in intensified pressure on organic growth in our market share. Despite the challenging market conditions, we maintain our outlook for EBITDA before special items of EUR 215m – EUR 235m.

Gross profit - The gross profit Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 143m, an increase of 17% compared to EUR 122m in Q2 2024, primarily due to front-loading of shipments and inventory stocking coming from the US tariffs situation. The gross profit in H1 2025 amounted to EUR 275m, an increase of 16% compared to EUR 238m in H1 2024, particularly driven by last year's acquisitions in Brazil and Italy, partly supported by ITN combined with double-digit growth in Air & Ocean volumes. Gross margin - The gross margin has been challenged in H1 2025 and was 21.8% compared to 23.3% in H1 2024. EBITDA before special items - EBITDA before special items in Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 51m, an increase of 19% compared to EUR 43m in Q2 2024. The EBITDA before special items amounted to EUR 94m for H1 2025, an increase of 13% compared to EUR 83m in H1 2024. Conversion ratio - The conversion ratio has increased by 0.5%-points in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The conversion ratio has decreased by 0.7%-points in H1 2025 compared to H1 2024 deriving from higher SG&A costs. Cash flow from operating activities - Cash flow from operating activities improved with EUR 3m in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The cash flow from operating activities in H1 2025 improved with EUR 63m compared to H1 2024, primarily impacted by the increase in NWC in Q1 2024 and a more muted NWC development in 2025. 2025 Outlook - In the first half of 2025, we delivered a stable performance with growth in Air & Ocean volumes, increasing our EBITDA before special items compared to the first half of 2024. However, we have been highly impacted by the geopolitical turmoil impacting the global freight market, especially around the Red Sea and the US tariff situation. Besides these factors impacting on our outlook, we also operate in a historically competitive market environment shaped by the increased level of consolidation in the industry, resulting in intensified pressure on organic growth in our market share. Despite the challenging market conditions, we maintain our outlook for EBITDA before special items of EUR 215m – EUR 235m.

Revenue for H1 increased by 21%, while capacity costs (other external expenses and staff costs) in the same period increased by 14%, contributing to improvement in EBITDA and lower cash burn from operations. Impero maintains the updated outlook for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range, and EBITDA in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025). SaaS metrics and financial highlights on 30 June 2025 ARR increased by 15% to DKK 40.7M, from DKK 35.4M on 30 June 2024 Net ARR growth in H1-2025 amounted to DKK 2.0M, compared to DKK 5.0M in H1-2024 Uplift was 6% YoY, compared to 13% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Churn was 2%, YoY compared to 4% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Net Revenue Retention was 105% compared to 109% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Revenue for H1-2025 increased by 21% to DKK 20.1M, compared to the same period in 2024 EBITDA for H1-2025 was negative DKK 4.2M, compared to negative DKK 5.1M for the first half of 2024 During the first half of 2025, Impero welcomed 9 new customers across Germany, the UK, and Denmark. These organizations span industries including financial services, manufacturing, shipping, and IT services. By the end of H1 2025, Impero served 32% of the Danish C25 index and 20% of the German DAX 40 index, with the majority of the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) generated outside Denmark. While Q1 typically shows limited momentum due to customers’ fiscal year-end processes, Q2 is traditionally a stronger period. However, Q2 2025 fell short of expectations, with macroeconomic uncertainty where potential new customers seemed more cautious than usual. Despite this, we achieved gross ARR growth of DKK 3.5M in H1 2025. This was largely driven by significant upsell activity among existing customers, especially large enterprises in Germany’s automotive and manufacturing sectors, as well as customers in other markets who are expanding the use of Impero across their organizations. However, contractions impacted our net new ARR which ended at DKK 2M for the period. Due to continued focus on customer success and platform adoption, churn remained below 2% over the past 12 months. “While the first half of the year presented some challenges, we remain optimistic. Market potential is intact, and Impero is well positioned to continue our growth journey. We see strong demand for our intuitive, easy-to-implement platform that enables organizations to meet rising requirements for risk management and internal controls. With a remarkable customer base, an expanding partner network, a strengthened team, and enhanced product development, we are well equipped for the road ahead”, says CEO Rikke Stampe Skov. Partnerships to support growth Partnerships continue to be a strategic pillar in our efforts to help organizations navigate compliance challenges. We collaborate closely with experts in governance, risk, and compliance, particularly across tax and finance domains. These partnerships support efficient implementation of Impero and provide access to best practice templates developed by our partners. Of new ARR generated in H1 2025, 33% originated through the partner channel. As a result of ongoing investments in partner development, we saw greater engagement throughout H1 particularly in Germany, where we onboarded new partners and secured our first customers through two of these. We believe the partner channel will remain a key driver for growth. Enhancing platform value The first half of 2025 marked a significant step forward in our mission to simplify compliance through strengthening risk & internal control management for enterprise- and highly-regulated organizations. Guided by our strategic direction, we focus on delivering high-impact capabilities that expand our platform’s value, improve operational oversight, and support more efficient workflows. Following a successful beta period throughout H1 2025, we launched Control Testing into general availability in July 2025. This module introduces a structured, audit-friendly way to assess the effectiveness of internal controls empowering organizations to proactively identify weaknesses, refine processes, and strengthen overall compliance assurance. In alignment with our general practices, Control Testing has been developed with extensive feedback from our customers, and we are already seeing solid interest from new and existing customers with several beta customers already using the feature to embed proactive testing into their compliance frameworks. Strategy update As part of our 2026 strategy “Increasing the Impact”, we remain focused on enhancing platform capabilities and accelerating delivery speed. We are investing in Product and Development team capacity, while also scaling our go-to-market efforts across geographies and channels to drive pipeline development and market expansion. Following limited traction with templated compliance solutions in the mid-market, and based on the EU Omnibus package, we will continue to concentrate on the enterprise segment where we have a proven track record of attracting and expanding customer relationships. This focused approach means we do not anticipate doubling our customer base by the end of 2026. Though ARR growth in H1 2025 was more modest than anticipated, we remain confident in being able to become cash flow positive before the end of 2026. Equity and capital Impero maintained a solid cash position of DKK 6.8M at the end of H1 2025. The company continues to apply a balanced approach to investment and cash generation, ensuring sufficient liquidity to pursue its strategic plan. As of 30 June 2025, Impero’s equity stood at DKK 0.2M, compared to DKK 6.2M at 31 December 2024. This reduction, which represents a loss of more than 50% of the company’s share capital, reflects the investments made to support long-term growth. It is not unusual for SaaS companies in growth phases to experience periods of negative equity as product development and market scaling are prioritized over short-term profitability. Despite this equity shortfall, Impero remains in a solid financial position. In accordance with the Danish Companies Act, the Board of Directors is currently assessing options to address the equity position. If relevant, an update will be provided at a general assembly no later than the end of November 2025. Organizational developments As communicated in Company Announcement 09-2025, our CFO Morten Lehmann Nielsen will be stepping down at the end of August to pursue a career opportunity outside of Impero. We thank Morten for his contribution over the past 3½ years and wish him all the best in his future role. On 25 August 2025 Impero announced the appointment of Kasper Lihn as CFO, effective 1 October 2025 (Company Announcement No. 15-2025). We are excited to welcome Kasper, who joins Impero from HC Andersen Capital, where he holds the position Head of Research and Managing Director. Outlook Impero maintains the updated ARR guidance for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range. The outlook corresponds to an expected annual ARR growth rate between 11% and 19%. The company’s EBITDA is expected to be in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025), with continued focus on cost discipline in light of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) developing below initial expectations, impacting the timing of new initiatives. For the full outlook, we refer to page 8 in the H1 Report 2025. Presentation of the Report Read the Report in its entirety via or in the attached.

Comment from the CEO Klimator holds a truly unique position in the market through our ability to base our analyses and forecasts on the local climate. We let factors such as topography, proximity to water, and elevation differences form the foundation for calculating the actual outcome on the ground. This enables us to predict when, where, and how roads will become slippery – with a precision few can match. This capability is the foundation of our core products and drives our growth, where high-quality revenues from Road Status Information and IoT road weather stations create a stable and scalable business. We are pleased to note that the turn around we have driven over the past two years is now starting to show in the numbers. The quarter, which is normally weaker due to seasonal variations, improved significantly – driven by existing customers placing hardware orders earlier, expanding with additional contracts, and by a steady increase in recurring software revenues. The company’s total revenue increased by 51% to MSEK 9,346 (MSEK 6,174) for the second quarter of 2025. Net sales for Q2 2025 amounted to MSEK 7,955, an increase of 70% compared to 2024. We also achieved a significant profit improvement of MSEK 2,300 for the period. Revenue and earnings growth are driven by high-quality revenues from long-term customers, not by public funding or capitalization of work in progress. During the past quarter, we have also strengthened Klimator’s forward trajectory in continuing to lead the digital and automated transformation of winter road maintenance. Through the recently completed investment round – in which both long-term external shareholders and Klimator Board and management participated – we have secured approximately MSEK 9.5 to accelerate our business. This capital enables the scaling and commercialization of our most innovative solutions, with Klimator Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting at the forefront. These technologies allow winter operations to be adapted in real time to current and forecasted road conditions – with clear effects on traffic safety, cost efficiency, and environmental impact. Opportunities are substantial, as the industry is in the start of a transformation where digitalization, data, and AI are rapidly shifting decision-making from reactive to proactive. Here, Klimator has a unique position thanks to our combination of road climatology research, multiple data sources processed with AI, and proven system solutions. Our vision is clear: to become the preferred partner for national road authorities, contractors, and municipalities that want to streamline, automate, and future-proof their winter operations. Going forward, we focus on turning our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth through high-quality revenues. We will achieve this through more strategic partnerships, expanded presence in key markets, and a strong focus on recurring revenues – with the ability to deliver value to customers, society, and shareholders. Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Going forward, our focus is on transforming our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth with high-quality revenues. This will be achieved by combining innovation with commercial strength, with the goal of creating long-term value for customers, society, and shareholders. We will achieve this by: Building more strategic partnerships with distributors and expanding our presence in key markets Increasing the share of recurring revenues through Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting Ensuring strong delivery capacity and quality Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Emil Danielsson, CEO Klimator AB About Klimator History Klimator is a Swedish software company that was founded in 2001 by Torbjörn Gustafsson and Jörgen Bogren. The founders have over 30 years of research experience in applied road climatology at the University of Gothenburg. Klimator’s technology is based on years of academic research into road weather conditions. In 2020, the company acquired HedeDanmark’s connected sensors (IoT) business to expand and strengthen Klimator’s product portfolio. Business areas To serve the market segments and customer groups addressed, Klimator’s activities are organized into two distinct business areas: Business Area Winter Maintenance Business Area Automotive In the Winter Maintenance business area, the company offers a web-based software application, Road Status Information (RSI), based on the company’s Road Condition Data (RCD) platform. The software is customized for the needs winter contractors face when making critical decisions about when and how to implement specific measures and how much salt or sand to lay down. Klimator’s software results in significant cost savings for an industry with annual revenues of around SEK 3 billion in Sweden alone. More efficient wintertime road maintenance also brings major environmental benefits, such as lower salt usage, lower fuel consumption, and less wear and tear on roads. The company’s IoT sensors give contractors, municipalities, and other organizations the ability to measure road surface temperature, air temperature, air humidity, rainfall, ground moisture, groundwater level, water level, and hydraulic flow in real-timI. With the help of sensors, data is collected and stored in Klimator’s IoT platform, where customers can avail themselves of a number of different services. For the customer, it’s a simple and easy introduction to a more modern, digital way to work. The company focuses on IoT sensors connected to winter road maintenance but offers other sensors as a service to existing customers. After establishing the Automotive business area late in 2019, the company carried out a number of successful Proof of Concept (PoC) and developmental projects with leading European and Japanese vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. There are several highly attractive areas of application for the company’s data platform (RCD) and sensor technology (AHEAD) within the automotive industry with respect to: improved driver information improved use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) safe and scalable Autonomous Driving technology (AD) Product portfolio Road Condition Data (RCD) is a cloud-based Data-as-a-Service platform (DaaS) that aggregates data from a number of different sources. Advanced climate models and Klimator’s unique classification model for the road network are used in tandem to process this data and deliver detailed real-time information and predictive forecasts about road weather conditions. This information can be applied in a number of different areas in the automotive industry, including intelligent Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and complex systems for autonomous vehicles (AD). Based on RCD, Road Status Information (RSI) is a digital Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that provides detailed forecasts for roads, bike paths, and pedestrian walkways. These high-resolution forecasts are used by transportation agencies and winter road contractors to make critical decisions about when, where, and how to implement snow removal and de-icing measures. Klimator’s forecasts facilitate decision-making, planning, and follow-up and Ilitate more efficient use of resources, which results in significant cost savings and a lessened impact on the environment. AHEAD is a sensor technology that analyzes road conditions and friction in front of a moving vehicle in real-time. The technology is the result of more than ten years of research and development into road condition classification. AHEAD gives vehicle system information about prevailing road conditions, which improves the functionality and utility of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving technology. Klimator’s IoT Road Weather Stations provides real-time information on how weather impacts local road conditions. This data will empower operators to make informed decisions on the appropriate treatments necessary. The data is easily accessible from the Road Status Information (RSI) platform. The data comes in the form of an API so can also be fed into other weather monitoring and forecasting systems if necessary.

The second quarter of 2025 kept confirming the positive trend of recent periods, with Net Sales and Internal Adjusted EBITDA on the level of previous year’s second quarter and a significantly higher Reported EBITDA. Despite higher amortization from finalized R&D projects the EBIT notably exceeded Q2-2024. Negative tax impacts prevented the Net Income to reach previous year’s Q2 level. Net Sales reached EUR 64,4m in Q2-2025, on the level of previous year’s quarter (Q2-2024: EUR 63,9m). Significantly higher demand in the Mobile Cooling segment driven by EV business in China compensated lower Net Sales in Stationary Cooling. At 25,1%, the Contribution Margin in % of Net Sales remained at the same level as recorded in Q2-2024 supported by stable production costs. The Internal Adjusted EBITDA of EUR 5,9m, coming close to EUR 6,1m achieved in Q2-2024, was driven by a stable Contribution Margin and well-controlled fixed costs, but recorded lower positive effects from inventory valuation and R&D capitalization. Despite higher Depreciation & Amortization the EBIT of EUR 2,1m surpassed significantly last year’s quarter (Q2-2024: EUR 1,4m). The Net Income in Q2-2025 finished at EUR -3,8m (Q2-2024: EUR -2m) due to negative tax impacts. For more details, please refer to the Interim Report Q2-2025 on .

Monsenso’s H1 2025 report was approved by the Board of Directors today. Performance highlights Total revenue was DKK 5,166k (H1 2024: DKK 5,527k). EBITDA was DKK -1,755k (H1 2024: DKK –1,270k). EBIT was DKK -4,066k (H1 2024: DKK –3,484k). Cash from operations was DKK 666k (H1 2024: DKK –3,840k). Cash and cash equivalents were DKK 1,381k (FY 2024: DKK 1,861k). Business review We are pleased to report on the results and the development in H1 2025. Our continued commitment to innovation and strategic growth has yielded significant progress across multiple areas. Commercial Milestones Implementation revenue grew by 12% in the period, driven by the launch of a digital research platform in Birmingham (UK), which will be used to provide long-term engagement and monitoring of patients with treatment-resistant depression Our major digital, decentralised patient-centric study on headache/migraine with a global pharmaceutical company was completed with great success. New subscription revenue did not fully offset the completion of this project in the first half of 2025, which is the primary reason for a 16% decline in subscription revenue during this period. In collaboration with three Spanish partners, we were selected as a vendor for a large project in a public tender in Spain, and the extensive work on this during the next months will contribute to the expected growth of the business for the second half of 2025. Innovation and Research Our three major innovation and research projects, Phase V, PERSONAE and MENTBEST are now operational and recruitment of patients is progressing across their total of five studies. However, the projects have been delayed due to difficulties with approvals and patient recruitment, but we now look forward to seeing the results over the next couple of years. We have added great new functionalities to our digital health platform, including treatment content queue, automated content recommendations and patient screening. Cash Flow The payments from customers and credits from suppliers have improved in the period, causing cash from operations to be DKK 0.7m compared to DKK -3.8m in H1 2024. Unchanged outlook for 2025 For 2025, we expect revenue to be DKK 12-13m, corresponding to growth of 8-16% and an EBIT of DKK -7m to DKK -6m. Uncertainties and other financial information for 2025 are included in notes 1 and 2. Management expects to have sufficient liquidity to manage the group's activities for the coming period.

Company Announcement no. 70/2025 (August 29, 2025) Movinn publishes H1 2025 Interim Report and revises full-year guidance following disappointing first half of 2025. This announcement contains inside information related to updated financial guidance for 2025. Financial highlights (DKK‘000) Revenue: 44,672 (H1 2024: 44,045) EBITDA: -1,688 (H1 2024: 2,184) EBIT: -4,224 (H1 2024: -597) Revenue in H1 2025 amounted to DKK 44.7 million, an increase of 1.4% compared to the same period last year. EBITDA came in at DKK -1.7 million and EBIT at DKK -4.2 million. The financial performance in the first half of 2025 has been below expectations. Q1 was weak and despite Q2 being better than Q1, the recovery from the weak first quarter has been slower than expected. The result is primarily driven by underperformance in secondary Danish markets and slower than expected momentum in Sweden. Cash flow has improved due to tighter working capital management and on the commercial side, Movinn signed a multi-year agreement with a large Danish C25 corporation during H1 2025. Disappointing half-year triggers accelerated actions In response to the disappointing performance in H1, Movinn has intensified efforts to improve profitability across the Group. Movinn is continuing the downscaling of underperforming units in Odense and has initiated a broader review of secondary and low-margin markets across the portfolio. Structural initiatives have also been launched in Sweden to address client concentration and restore demand. We are not satisfied with the results in H1. It’s a disappointing performance, and we are taking action. We are adjusting our setup and reallocating resources to improve profitability going forward, says CEO Patrick Blok. Updated financial guidance for 2025 (inside information) As a result of the underperformance in H1 and slower than expected recovery from Q1, Movinn has revised its full-year financial guidance for 2025: Revenue: DKK 91-93 million (previously DKK 93-97 million) EBITDA: DKK 0-2 millioon (previously DKK 5-7 million) EBIT: DKK -5 to -3 million (previously DKK 0-2 million) Despite the adjustment of the financial guidance, Movinn maintains its long term strategic direction under Core’27 with focus on profitability and efficiency.

Kapitaludvidelsen sikrer både selve finansieringen af opkøbet af NMP og styrker Errias egenkapital. Erria vurderer, at tilføjelsen af NMP vil udbygge koncernens tekniske platforme samt give adgang til nye kundegrupper og vækstmuligheder. Overtagelsen af Hellerup-baserede NMP, der leverer teknisk rådgivning og ""Manage-the-Manager"" ydelser til internationale skibsejere, sker som led i Errias vækststrategi og bidrager til bundlinjen fra dag ét. NMP vil fremadrettet vil blive drevet som et selvstændigt selskab, 100% ejet af Erria A/S, med fuld “business as ususal” kontinuitet ift. kundehåndtering, nuværende medarbejdersammensætning og daglig ledelse anført af eksisterende direktør Henrik Christensen. NMP beskæftiger på nuværende tidspunkt syv medarbejdere og har p.t. 14 skibe under ledelse. Ny bestyrelse med branche-koryfæer Errias ledelse anser tilførslen af stærke kompetencer og tung erfaring som en vigtig brik i selskabets vækststrategi. I forbindelse med, at Erria A/S pr. 1. september 2025 overtager 100% af aktierne i Nordic Marine Partner ApS, er der derfor nedsat en ny bestyrelse for NMP bestående af: Henrik N. Andersen , formand, CEO, Erria A/S. Niels Josefsen , tidligere CEO i Lauritzen Bulkers A/S, samt positioner i Klaveness og Maersk og i alt 18 års erfaring i Asien. Per Wistoft , Per Wistoft , maritim rådgiver og partner i Maritime Strategy. Var 20 år hos de danske Rederier A.P. Møller og Norden herunder opstart af sidstnævntes Tank-afdeling inden en international karriere som CEO i flere udenlandske tankrederier. Per Wistoft har en EMBA fra SIMI i København (nu CBS). Henrik N. Andersen, CEO i Erria A/S og fra dags dato formand for bestyrelsen i NMP, udtaler: “Vi er lykkes med at tiltrække stærke profiler som Niels Josefsen og Per Wistoft til NMP. De bringer hver især en unik og værdifuld erfaring fra henholdsvis tørlast- og tank-markedet, som vil bestyrke NMP’s strategiske udvikling. Sammen med stifter og direktør Henrik Christensen ser vi alle tre frem til at sætte kursen for den spændende rejse, som NMP nu begiver sig ud på som en del af Erria-familien.” I forbindelse med sin tiltrædelse i NMP’s bestyrelse udtaler Niels Josefsen: ""Jeg har fulgt Nordic Marine Partner siden min tid som CEO i Lauritzen Bulkers, hvor vi havde et tæt samarbejde med Henrik Christensen. Det står klart for mig, at der er et voksende behov for den type service, NMP leverer, i takt med at mange rederier outsourcer deres tekniske management. Jeg har stor tillid til Henrik Christensen som stifter og lederskikkelse, og jeg ser frem til at bidrage med mine erfaringer og mit netværk til at udvikle NMP yderligere.” I forbindelse med sin tiltrædelse i NMP’s bestyrelse udtaler Per Wistoft: ""Jeg har i en årrække haft fornøjelsen af at følge og assistere Nordic Marine Partner som rådgiver og har dermed set på nært hold, hvordan Henrik Christensen har udviklet konceptet. Nu, hvor NMP bliver en del af Erria, ser jeg et spændende afsæt for den videre rejse. Jeg glæder mig til at bidrage med mine erfaringer fra en lang international karriere og til at fortsætte samarbejdet med Henrik Christensen i Erria-regi.""

Resultatet ger Elon utmärkelsen ”Fantastiska Kundmöten”. Kundmötesbarometern är en omfattande årlig undersökning vars syfte är att på ett djupare plan förstå vad som driver lojalitet och försäljning, i mötet med säljaren, i den fysiska butiken. Mätningen är framtagen och baserad på forskning inom marknadsföring och konsumentbeteende. Undersökningen utgår från ett kundperspektiv och fokuserar på själva kundmötet, interaktionen med säljaren. Årets rapport är baserad på 1176 besök i svensk retail under maj och juni 2025 där både köp skett men även där kunden lämnat butiken utan att handla. Elons resultat visar bland annat att 100 % av kunderna hade kontakt med en säljare, något som sticker ut rejält från genomsnittet på 65 % och elektronikbranschens snitt 87 %. ”Att få utmärkelsen ” Fantastiska Kundmöten” är ett viktigt bevis på att våra kunder uppskattar vårt fokus på bemötande. Det allra viktigaste – och svåraste – är att skapa en företagskultur där ett bra kundmöte är en självklarhet. Därför tränar vi kontinuerligt och uppmuntrar butikerna att våga testa olika sätt att möta kunderna, något som uppenbarligen ger goda resultat”, säger Anna Leo, Retail Manager på Elon Group. ”Årets Kundmötesbarometer visar att kunderna i allt högre grad söker möten med säljare, men kraven har blivit tuffare. Missar man i mötet går kunden vidare till en annan butik. Våra siffror visar också att säljarkontakten har stor påverkan på köp: de kunder som möter en säljare handlar oftare och för större belopp än de som inte gör det. Därför gäller det att ta vara på varje kundmöte. Med utmärkelsen Fantastiska Kundmöten vill vi uppmärksamma de kedjor som lyckas bäst i vår mätning. Elon är i år en av de tre som placerar sig allra högst - en prestation som förtjänar att lyftas fram” säger Lotta Eriksson, VD för Dive Custitude .

In geographic terms, the US along with the Swedish operations made the largest contribution to the sales growth, despite the fact the outcomes in the US were hampered by exchange-rate effects. The ongoing transition to service sales is progressing well, with growing recurring revenue. First quarter: May–July 2025 * Contracted order bookings rose 112.9% to SEK 1,309.5 million (615.0), of which SEK 1,192.3 million (543.1) pertained to guaranteed order bookings. Of the guaranteed order bookings, 7% were recognized as revenue during the quarter and a further estimated 13–23% will pertain to revenue within 12 months after the end of the quarter. * Net sales increased 5.8% to SEK 765.9 million (723.8). Based on unadjusted exchange rates compared with the year-earlier period, the increase was 12.1%. Recurring revenue accounted for SEK 549.2 million (482.3) of net sales, up 13.9%. Based on unadjusted exchange rates, the increase was 20.8%. Cloud recurring revenue (CRR) increased 46.1% to SEK 179.4 million (122.8). * Operating profit rose 19.0% to SEK 118.8 million (99.8), corresponding to an operating margin of 15.5% (13.8). The outcome includes SEK 36.1 million (12.5) in costs for share-based incentive programs. The increase was partly attributable to the start of a new program after the comparative quarter and partly to the share price trend. Based on unadjusted exchange rates compared with the year-earlier period, operating profit rose 35.9%. * Profit for the period amounted to SEK 102.8 million (80.4). * Cash flow from operations amounted to SEK 118.1 million (-56.7). The change was primarily the result of a decrease in capital tied up in current receivables. Comments from Torbjörn Kronander, President and CEO of Sectra AB “The fiscal year started with a favorable performance in both medical IT and cybersecurity. Growth in North America was particularly notable. We are also making progress in our change of business model to selling medical diagnostic imaging to healthcare providers. At the same time, we continue to strengthen society’s resilience against cyberthreats through our information security solutions. “The extensive customer contracts we secured in the last fiscal year will soon enter a phase during which customers will start to deploy our solutions, albeit gradually over a number of years. While several large healthcare providers will start producing examinations in 2025/2026, we expect the financial impact from this to remain relatively small during the fiscal year. Once these customers go live, our focus will be on helping them to maximize the benefits of our services and increasing their use—efforts that will ultimately generate stable growth in recurring revenue and further strengthen our customer relationships. “In Secure Communications, we see continuing favorable demand, not least as a result of security developments. While NATO’s decision during the summer to increase member states’ defense and security investments has not had an immediate impact on our business, it will create further opportunities in the long term. We are well positioned to contribute solutions for secure communication and information sharing that make societies more resistant to cyberthreats. Our solutions were used, for example, at the NATO summit in the Netherlands during the summer.” Read the attached financial report for further CEO comments and information.

Through Grahns, Humble intends to invest approximately SEK 135 million in machinery and adaptations of the Facility’s infrastructure (the “Investment”). The Investment will be carried out in two phases, with the first phase starting immediately, and production at the Facility is expected to begin in summer 2026. At full capacity, the increased production is expected to generate approximately SEK 300 million in net sales and SEK 60 million in EBITDA annually. The Investment Through Grahns, Humble intends to invest approximately SEK 135 million in machinery and infrastructure upgrades. The Investment will be carried out in two phases: Phase 1: Approximately SEK 100 million will be invested in a new production line, including kitchen and cooking equipment, drying cabinets, and packaging machines. About SEK 60 million of this is expected to be allocated during the third and fourth quarters of 2025, with the remaining SEK 40 million planned for the first half of 2026. Phase 2: Additional machinery will be added to fully realize the capacity of the new production line. This phase is expected to take place in 2028 and amount to approximately SEK 35 million. The lease agreement and the Investment form an important part of Humble’s overall strategy to increase the capacity of its industrial platform and create favorable conditions to continue driving organic and profitable growth. “ We see rapidly growing demand for confectionery products among our own brands and distribution companies. In addition, the market is developing positively, with incoming requests for contract manufacturing far exceeding our available capacity from external customers – both in Sweden and for export. The Investment enables us to scale up capacity with greater efficiency and is expected to generate stable returns on invested capital. ” says Simon Petrén, CEO, Humble Group AB. Doubled Volume and Strengthened Profitability Through the Facility, Grahns expects to at least double its production volume of soft confectionery products, particularly jelly, where demand is highest. At full utilization of the Facility, Grahns is expected to produce approximately 11,000 tons of jelly per year. The increased capacity is expected to generate around SEK 300 million in additional sales and approximately SEK 60 million in improved EBITDA annually. “ With the Investment, we are taking another step towards becoming a leading confectionery manufacturer in Sweden. We are strengthening our overall capacity and creating the conditions to scale up sugar-reduced candy products faster, without compromising Grahns’ classic candy favorites. The economies of scale within the central organization increase our competitiveness and enable us to improve profitability going forward. ” says Jesper Lööw, CEO, Grahns Konfektyr AB. Timeline The production facility is expected to be completed and operational in the summer of 2026. The financial impact of the Investment is expected to be realized gradually from the second half of 2026, reaching full effect within approximately four years. The Facility The Facility is owned by S tenhus, which has leased the premises to Rockwool. The Facility has a total area of approximately 15,000 square meters, of which around 12,000 square meters are production and warehouse space. The agreement has been entered into on favorable terms during the initial lease period and in connection with the takeover of the lease, Rockwool will transfer certain machinery and equipment in the factory to Grahns free of charge.

The sanction is related to a case in the summer of 2022, which S-Bank has already announced earlier and which the bank has investigated in cooperation with the authority. In the case, suspected criminals exploited an exceptional and very difficult-to-detect malfunction found in the software of S-Bank's system provider. The abuse targeted a small number of S-Bank’s customers. The system malfunction was corrected as soon as it was detected. Immediate measures were taken to protect customer data and minimise damage. In its decision, the Data Protection Authority also states that S-Bank has taken appropriate measures to mitigate, repair or prevent damage in the future. S-Bank has compensated all direct damage caused to customers. The Data Protection Authority's decision will have no impact on S-Bank's customers. Customers can trust the security of S-Bank's services. S-Bank is continuously improving its operating practices and risk management to ensure the security of its services in the changing operating environment.

Published: 2025-09-10 06:30:01 CEST FOM Technologies A/S - Investor News FOM Technologies wins order from U.S. National Defense Lab. 10.9.2025 06:30:01 CEST | FOM Technologies | Investor News Investor news no. 57 – 2025 | Copenhagen, the 10th of September 2025 FOM Technologies has received a purchase order from one of only three U.S. National Defense Laboratories. This marks the company’s fifth U.S. national laboratory customer and its first defense-focused national lab. In accordance with the agreement, FOM Technologies will not disclose the identity of the laboratory. The order includes versatile lab-scale slot-die coating equipment, which will be integrated into advanced materials R&D operations - supporting research at the intersection of national security and emerging defense technologies. Top management will ensure immediate delivery. Martin Kiener, CEO of FOM Technologies Inc., commented: “This marks our fifth U.S. national lab client, following collaborations with Argonne, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL)—but it is our very first in the defense research space.

The number of approved contracts for new Rusta stores is at an all-time high. “We are excited to kick off the autumn in the best possible way by continuing our high-paced store expansion across the Nordic markets. During the year, we also look forward to opening our first city store in Helsinki.

The positive revenue performance reflected an increase in sales of both instruments, consumables and services. The launch of the new XcytoMatic products is proceeding as planned. “Along with our strong focus on creating renewed momentum in our existing business, we spent considerable resources during the financial year on launching our new high-tech XcytoMatic products. The launch of the XcytoMatic 40 is paving the way for ChemoMetec in the bioprocessing market, while the new XcytoMatic 30 and 50 instruments, both of which were developed on the same technology platform as the XcytoMatic 40, address our cell and gene therapy customers’ demand for automation. Automation is an attractive new market for us, and we believe that ChemoMetec has a strong market position in the current surge in automation – and we are in a process of taking full advantage of this opportunity. In the coming year, we will further accelerate the marketing of our new products, complete the development of another member of the XcytoMatic family, the XcytoMatic 50, continue working on the development of a new automation solution, the Sample Mana-gement System, and strengthen our software development while also maintaining focus on our existing business. We are very confident that our new solutions will make a strong contribution to our growth in the coming years. However, it is important to bear in mind that the XcytoMatic instruments address bioprocessing customers and customers with automation projects – and that the validation and decision-making process in this segment is relatively long. This means that it will require a degree of patience to unlock the expected great potential of our new products,” says Martin Helbo Behrens, CEO. Financial results In the 2024/25 financial year, revenue grew by 22% to DKK 495.6 million measured both in Danish kroner and at constant exchange rates. 59% of ChemoMetec’s revenue was generated in the USA/Canada, 32% in Europe and 9% in the rest of the world, unchanged relative to the 2023/24 financial year. Sales of instruments grew by 22% in 2024/25, while sales of consumables and services grew by 20% and 25%, respectively. EBITDA amounted to DKK 258.0 million in 2024/25, against DKK 186.2 million in 2023/24. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue without a corresponding increase in costs. EBITDA was however affected by non-recurring restructuring costs of DKK 11.8 million. The EBITDA margin for 2024/25 was 52%, against 46% in 2023/24. The profit for the year was up by DKK 50.1 million year-on-year to DKK 186.4 million. Revenue for the year was in line with the preliminary 2024/25 figure announced on 1 July 2025, and EBITDA was in line with the most recent guidance announced on 10 January 2025. The Board of Directors proposes to the general meeting that a dividend of DKK 7.0 per share, equivalent to a total dividend payout of DKK 121.8 million, be distributed for the 2024/25 financial year. Guidance For 2025/26, ChemoMetec expects revenue in the range of DKK 545-565 million and EBITDA in the range of DKK 295-315 million.

Outlook for the financial year 2025 Puuilo reiterates the outlook for the financial year 2025 provided in its financial statements release on 27 March 2025 and reiterated in its Q1 business review on 10 June 2025. The company forecasts that net sales will be €425 – 455 million and the adjusted EBITA will be €70 – 80 million in the financial year 2025. The forecast includes elements of uncertainty related to changes in consumer purchasing power and behaviour. Additionally, geopolitical crises and international tensions may affect product availability and prices. Puuilo’s long-term targets The company’s long-term financial targets for the strategy period 2024 – 2028: Growth: Net sales above €600 million by the end of financial year 2028 (ends in January 2029) Profitability: Adjusted EBITA margin above 17% of net sales Profit distribution: The company aims to distribute at least 80% of net income for each financial year Leverage: Net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.0x Puuilo will publish the updated long-term targets for the strategy period 2026 – 2030 today, 11 September 2025. CEO Juha Saarela’s review Puuilo delivered a solid performance in Q2. Net sales growth was 13.2% (+14.9%) and a like-for-like growth was 1.3% (+2.1%). Customer traffic continued to grow. Across all stores, the growth was +14.6% and +2.8% in like-for-like stores. In Q2, the average basket size decreased by 1.2% (decrease of 2.8%) compared to last year. However, the rate of decrease in average basket size slowed down. We observe cautious optimism in the air regarding a potential stabilization in the average basket size towards the end of the year, supported by slightly improved figures in recent consumer confidence and other economic indicators. In Puuilo’s case, the decline in average basket size may also be influenced by increased brand awareness and, to some extent, the expansion of our store network, which encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently as accessibility improves through new store openings. In Q2, Puuilo’s adjusted EBITA was €28.2 million (€24.8 million), which reflects an increase of 13.7% compared to last year. The EBITA increase was driven by strong net sales development, effective cost control, and an improved gross margin. In Q2, the Group’s gross margin was 38.2% (37.6%) increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to previous year. The positive development in gross margin was particularly supported by the strong growth in net sales of private label products. Operating cash flow in Q2 was strong, amounting to €38.1 million (€31.7 million). The solid cash flow was supported by strong EBITA. Growth continues. During the past quarter, we opened two new stores: Mäntsälä in May and Jyväskylä Keljo in June. The latter is the second store in Jyväskylä. As usual, the openings went smoothly and attracted plenty of customers. Later in the financial year, we will open new stores in Iisalmi and Heinola. This brings the total number of new store openings for the year to seven. The opening calendar for the financial year 2026 is also nearly full. We have already announced new stores in Espoonlahti and Hollola. In addition, Vantaa Virkamies store will be relocated to Vantaa Tammisto. More news regarding 2026 store openings is still to come. Today, we will publish Puuilo’s strategy update and new financial targets extending through the financial year 2030. By the end of the strategy period, we are aiming for a network of at least 100 stores, annual average net sales growth of over 10%, and total net sales exceeding €800 million. Our profitability target is to achieve an adjusted EBITA margin of over 17%. Puuilo will start an organic international expansion by opening first pilot stores in Sweden during the strategy period. In doing so, we aim to ensure that Puuilo’s long-term growth continues. That said, because our concept has demonstrated strong performance also in smaller cities, we increased our target for the long-term potential in Finland to over 90 stores. Additionally, we will continue to focus on maintaining like-for-like growth, increasing the share of private label products, streamlining the customer experience, and advancing our sustainability agenda. Puuilo’s future and growth outlook remain strong. Finally, I want to thank our personnel, customers and shareholders! Significant events after the end of the reporting period Flagging notification Puuilo has received a notification on 11 August 2025 in accordance with Chapter 9, Section 5 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.

Outlook for the financial year 2025 Puuilo reiterates the outlook for the financial year 2025 provided in its financial statements release on 27 March 2025 and reiterated in its Q1 business review on 10 June 2025. The company forecasts that net sales will be €425 – 455 million and the adjusted EBITA will be €70 – 80 million in the financial year 2025. The forecast includes elements of uncertainty related to changes in consumer purchasing power and behaviour. Additionally, geopolitical crises and international tensions may affect product availability and prices. Puuilo’s long-term targets The company’s long-term financial targets for the strategy period 2024 – 2028: Growth: Net sales above €600 million by the end of financial year 2028 (ends in January 2029) Profitability: Adjusted EBITA margin above 17% of net sales Profit distribution: The company aims to distribute at least 80% of net income for each financial year Leverage: Net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.0x Puuilo will publish the updated long-term targets for the strategy period 2026 – 2030 today, 11 September 2025. CEO Juha Saarela’s review Puuilo delivered a solid performance in Q2. Net sales growth was 13.2% (+14.9%) and a like-for-like growth was 1.3% (+2.1%). Customer traffic continued to grow. Across all stores, the growth was +14.6% and +2.8% in like-for-like stores. In Q2, the average basket size decreased by 1.2% (decrease of 2.8%) compared to last year. However, the rate of decrease in average basket size slowed down. We observe cautious optimism in the air regarding a potential stabilization in the average basket size towards the end of the year, supported by slightly improved figures in recent consumer confidence and other economic indicators. In Puuilo’s case, the decline in average basket size may also be influenced by increased brand awareness and, to some extent, the expansion of our store network, which encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently as accessibility improves through new store openings. In Q2, Puuilo’s adjusted EBITA was €28.2 million (€24.8 million), which reflects an increase of 13.7% compared to last year. The EBITA increase was driven by strong net sales development, effective cost control, and an improved gross margin. In Q2, the Group’s gross margin was 38.2% (37.6%) increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to previous year. The positive development in gross margin was particularly supported by the strong growth in net sales of private label products. Operating cash flow in Q2 was strong, amounting to €38.1 million (€31.7 million). The solid cash flow was supported by strong EBITA. Growth continues. During the past quarter, we opened two new stores: Mäntsälä in May and Jyväskylä Keljo in June. The latter is the second store in Jyväskylä. As usual, the openings went smoothly and attracted plenty of customers. Later in the financial year, we will open new stores in Iisalmi and Heinola. This brings the total number of new store openings for the year to seven. The opening calendar for the financial year 2026 is also nearly full. We have already announced new stores in Espoonlahti and Hollola. In addition, Vantaa Virkamies store will be relocated to Vantaa Tammisto. More news regarding 2026 store openings is still to come. Today, we will publish Puuilo’s strategy update and new financial targets extending through the financial year 2030. By the end of the strategy period, we are aiming for a network of at least 100 stores, annual average net sales growth of over 10%, and total net sales exceeding €800 million. Our profitability target is to achieve an adjusted EBITA margin of over 17%. Puuilo will start an organic international expansion by opening first pilot stores in Sweden during the strategy period. In doing so, we aim to ensure that Puuilo’s long-term growth continues. That said, because our concept has demonstrated strong performance also in smaller cities, we increased our target for the long-term potential in Finland to over 90 stores. Additionally, we will continue to focus on maintaining like-for-like growth, increasing the share of private label products, streamlining the customer experience, and advancing our sustainability agenda. Puuilo’s future and growth outlook remain strong. Finally, I want to thank our personnel, customers and shareholders!

The company forecasts that net sales will be €425 – 455 million and the adjusted EBITA will be €70 – 80 million in the financial year 2025. The forecast includes elements of uncertainty related to changes in consumer purchasing power and behaviour. Additionally, geopolitical crises and international tensions may affect product availability and prices. Puuilo’s long-term targets The company’s long-term financial targets for the strategy period 2024 – 2028: Growth: Net sales above €600 million by the end of financial year 2028 (ends in January 2029) Profitability: Adjusted EBITA margin above 17% of net sales Profit distribution: The company aims to distribute at least 80% of net income for each financial year Leverage: Net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.0x Puuilo will publish the updated long-term targets for the strategy period 2026 – 2030 today, 11 September 2025. CEO Juha Saarela’s review Puuilo delivered a solid performance in Q2. Net sales growth was 13.2% (+14.9%) and a like-for-like growth was 1.3% (+2.1%). Customer traffic continued to grow. Across all stores, the growth was +14.6% and +2.8% in like-for-like stores. In Q2, the average basket size decreased by 1.2% (decrease of 2.8%) compared to last year. However, the rate of decrease in average basket size slowed down. We observe cautious optimism in the air regarding a potential stabilization in the average basket size towards the end of the year, supported by slightly improved figures in recent consumer confidence and other economic indicators. In Puuilo’s case, the decline in average basket size may also be influenced by increased brand awareness and, to some extent, the expansion of our store network, which encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently as accessibility improves through new store openings. In Q2, Puuilo’s adjusted EBITA was €28.2 million (€24.8 million), which reflects an increase of 13.7% compared to last year. The EBITA increase was driven by strong net sales development, effective cost control, and an improved gross margin. In Q2, the Group’s gross margin was 38.2% (37.6%) increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to previous year. The positive development in gross margin was particularly supported by the strong growth in net sales of private label products. Operating cash flow in Q2 was strong, amounting to €38.1 million (€31.7 million). The solid cash flow was supported by strong EBITA. Growth continues. During the past quarter, we opened two new stores: Mäntsälä in May and Jyväskylä Keljo in June. The latter is the second store in Jyväskylä. As usual, the openings went smoothly and attracted plenty of customers. Later in the financial year, we will open new stores in Iisalmi and Heinola. This brings the total number of new store openings for the year to seven. The opening calendar for the financial year 2026 is also nearly full. We have already announced new stores in Espoonlahti and Hollola. In addition, Vantaa Virkamies store will be relocated to Vantaa Tammisto. More news regarding 2026 store openings is still to come. Today, we will publish Puuilo’s strategy update and new financial targets extending through the financial year 2030. By the end of the strategy period, we are aiming for a network of at least 100 stores, annual average net sales growth of over 10%, and total net sales exceeding €800 million. Our profitability target is to achieve an adjusted EBITA margin of over 17%. Puuilo will start an organic international expansion by opening first pilot stores in Sweden during the strategy period. In doing so, we aim to ensure that Puuilo’s long-term growth continues. That said, because our concept has demonstrated strong performance also in smaller cities, we increased our target for the long-term potential in Finland to over 90 stores. Additionally, we will continue to focus on maintaining like-for-like growth, increasing the share of private label products, streamlining the customer experience, and advancing our sustainability agenda. Puuilo’s future and growth outlook remain strong. Finally, I want to thank our personnel, customers and shareholders!

Outlook for the financial year 2025 Puuilo reiterates the outlook for the financial year 2025 provided in its financial statements release on 27 March 2025 and reiterated in its Q1 business review on 10 June 2025. The company forecasts that net sales will be €425 – 455 million and the adjusted EBITA will be €70 – 80 million in the financial year 2025. The forecast includes elements of uncertainty related to changes in consumer purchasing power and behaviour. Additionally, geopolitical crises and international tensions may affect product availability and prices. Puuilo’s long-term targets The company’s long-term financial targets for the strategy period 2024 – 2028: Growth: Net sales above €600 million by the end of financial year 2028 (ends in January 2029) Profitability: Adjusted EBITA margin above 17% of net sales Profit distribution: The company aims to distribute at least 80% of net income for each financial year Leverage: Net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.0x Puuilo will publish the updated long-term targets for the strategy period 2026 – 2030 today, 11 September 2025. CEO Juha Saarela’s review Puuilo delivered a solid performance in Q2. Net sales growth was 13.2% (+14.9%) and a like-for-like growth was 1.3% (+2.1%). Customer traffic continued to grow. Across all stores, the growth was +14.6% and +2.8% in like-for-like stores. In Q2, the average basket size decreased by 1.2% (decrease of 2.8%) compared to last year. However, the rate of decrease in average basket size slowed down. We observe cautious optimism in the air regarding a potential stabilization in the average basket size towards the end of the year, supported by slightly improved figures in recent consumer confidence and other economic indicators. In Puuilo’s case, the decline in average basket size may also be influenced by increased brand awareness and, to some extent, the expansion of our store network, which encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently as accessibility improves through new store openings. In Q2, Puuilo’s adjusted EBITA was €28.2 million (€24.8 million), which reflects an increase of 13.7% compared to last year. The EBITA increase was driven by strong net sales development, effective cost control, and an improved gross margin. In Q2, the Group’s gross margin was 38.2% (37.6%) increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to previous year. The positive development in gross margin was particularly supported by the strong growth in net sales of private label products. Operating cash flow in Q2 was strong, amounting to €38.1 million (€31.7 million). The solid cash flow was supported by strong EBITA. Growth continues. During the past quarter, we opened two new stores: Mäntsälä in May and Jyväskylä Keljo in June. The latter is the second store in Jyväskylä. As usual, the openings went smoothly and attracted plenty of customers. Later in the financial year, we will open new stores in Iisalmi and Heinola. This brings the total number of new store openings for the year to seven. The opening calendar for the financial year 2026 is also nearly full. We have already announced new stores in Espoonlahti and Hollola. In addition, Vantaa Virkamies store will be relocated to Vantaa Tammisto. More news regarding 2026 store openings is still to come. Today, we will publish Puuilo’s strategy update and new financial targets extending through the financial year 2030. By the end of the strategy period, we are aiming for a network of at least 100 stores, annual average net sales growth of over 10%, and total net sales exceeding €800 million. Our profitability target is to achieve an adjusted EBITA margin of over 17%. Puuilo will start an organic international expansion by opening first pilot stores in Sweden during the strategy period. In doing so, we aim to ensure that Puuilo’s long-term growth continues. That said, because our concept has demonstrated strong performance also in smaller cities, we increased our target for the long-term potential in Finland to over 90 stores. Additionally, we will continue to focus on maintaining like-for-like growth, increasing the share of private label products, streamlining the customer experience, and advancing our sustainability agenda. Puuilo’s future and growth outlook remain strong. Finally, I want to thank our personnel, customers and shareholders!

Bakgrunden är att lanseringen av bolagets nya storefronts inte kommit igång i den takt som tidigare planerats. Uppdaterade mål för 2025 Nettoomsättning: 110 MSEK EBITDA: 2 MSEK Utfall 2024 Nettoomsättning: 82,8 MSEK EBITDA: -2,8 MSEK De nya målen för 2025 innebär en ökning i nettoomsättningen med drygt 30 % samt en förbättring i EBITDA om cirka 5 MSEK. Tidigare kommunicerade mål 2025 Nettoomsättning: 120–150 MSEK EBITDA: 5–8 MSEK 2026 Nettoomsättning: 150–200 MSEK EBITDA: 8–12 MSEK Kommentar Givet framförallt att de nya storefrontsen inte kommit igång som planerat ser bolaget behov av att justera sina mål. Buyersclub bedömer nu att nettoomsättningen ökar med drygt 30 % till 110 MSEK under 2025 och att EBITDA förbättras med cirka 5 MSEK jämfört med utfallet 2024. Med de nya målen anpassas förväntningarna till den takt storefronts kan bidra, samtidigt som fokus kvarstår på lönsamhet och tillväxt. ”Vi ser en fortsatt stark underliggande affär med ökad omsättning och förbättrad lönsamhet. Att storefronts inte utvecklats i den takt vi räknat med resulterar i en fördröjning, inget annat. Med justerade mål för 2025 kan vi ge en mer realistisk bild av vad som är möjligt för bolaget att åstadkomma utan hjälp från nya storefronts.”, säger Emil Henriksson, VD för Sweden Buyersclub AB. Certified Adviser Augment Partners AB är bolagets Certified Adviser. Telefon: +46 8-604 22 55 E-post: För mer information, vänligen kontakta: Emil Henriksson, VD Sweden Buyersclub AB Telefon: (+46) 73 37 71 937 E-post: Denna information är sådan information som Sweden Buyersclub AB är skyldigt att offentliggöra enligt EU:s marknadsmissbruksförordning (EU) nr 596/2014. Informationen lämnades, genom ovanstående kontaktpersons försorg, för offentliggörande den 11 september 2025 kl. 13:00 CET. Om Buyersclub: Sweden Buyersclub AB är ett teknikdrivet e-handelsbolag med en skalbar och automatiserad plattform som möjliggör snabb expansion utan att kostnaderna växer i samma takt som intäkterna. Bolaget kombinerar en prenumerationsbaserad affärsmodell – via buyersclub.se – med ett växande ekosystem av nischade webbutiker. Sortimentet sträcker sig över fler än tio kategorier, inklusive skönhet, elektronik, husdjursprodukter, böcker, leksaker, kontorsvaror och möbler. För prismedvetna konsumenter erbjuder buyersclub.se medlemskapet Buyersclub Plus, som ger tillgång till inköpspriser, fri frakt, lägsta prisgaranti och andra exklusiva förmåner. För bolaget innebär medlemsmodellen en återkommande och förutsägbar intäktsström, vilket skapar stabilitet och långsiktighet i affären. Buyersclubs digitala plattform synkroniserar produktdata och lagerstatus direkt med leverantörer, vilket kraftigt minskar behovet av eget lager och därmed reducerar kapitalbindning – en betydande risk och kostnad för traditionella e-handelsbolag. Genom omfattande teknikinvesteringar har bolaget byggt ett unikt, automatiserat system som hanterar hela orderflödet sömlöst och i realtid, oavsett försäljningskanal. Algoritmer optimerar prissättning och distribution, vilket möjliggör skalbar tillväxt utan ökade fasta kostnader. Som komplement till detta används ett smart crossdocking-lager, som fungerar som en effektiv omlastningspunkt där varor från flera olika leverantörer anländer och snabbt paketeras om till en samlad försändelse – utan att lagras under längre tid. Denna kombination minimerar lagerhållning, sänker kapitalbindningen och ger kunden en enhetlig leverans – även vid köp av flera produkter från olika leverantörer – vilket förbättrar köpupplevelsen. Under 2024 vidareutvecklades plattformen för att möjliggöra spegling av sortimentet till flera så kallade storefronts. Först ut var bookhero.se och norimont.com under 2024, följt av kontorsjätten.se och möbeljätten.se i början av 2025. Genom dessa kan delar av Buyersclubs sortiment paketeras om för nya målgrupper – utan att det kräver ytterligare resurser. Dessa hemsidor använder samma tekniska plattform, personal, lager och logistiklösning som buyersclub.se , vilket gör det möjligt för bolaget att snabbt och kostnadseffektivt expandera sitt affärsutbud, nå nya kundgrupper och ta större marknadsandelar. Buyersclubs modell innebär att varje ny kanal – oavsett om det är en egen nischad sajt eller en extern marknadsplats – direkt kan kopplas till den centrala infrastrukturen, vilket skapar stora möjligheter för lönsam tillväxt.

The Composite product group generated revenue growth, while the FOC product group’s revenue declined. Operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items for Q1-Q3 2024/25 was DKKm 43.7 (DKKm 25.8) 1 and operating profit (EBIT) before special items was DKKm 33.3 (DKKm 13.7). Both revenue and earnings were realised at the upper end of the previously guided range for the first nine months of 2024/25. The improved earnings were due to a favourable product mix and realised productivity enhancements resulting from investments in production and ongoing optimisation of operations. For Q1-Q3 2024/25, the Group posted a profit from continuing operations before tax of DKKm 28.7 (DKKm 12.9). In Company Announcement no. 8 dated 24 July 2025, the Company stated that the divestment of Roblon’s US subsidiary had been completed. The effects of this on Roblon’s interim financial statements for the first nine months are as follows: A loss of DKKm 33.1 was recognised in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period, DKKm 5.4 of which related to advisory fees. An accumulated translation reserve of DKKm -10.2 concerning the divested US subsidiary was reclassified from equity and recognised as a loss in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period. Roblon’s receivable from the divested US subsidiary was written down from approx. USDm 12.5 to USDm 5.2 and included in Roblon’s non-current receivable in the amount of DKKm 33.7 at 31 July 2025. Roblon has retained ownership of one share with special dividend rights in the divested US subsidiary. The value of the share is recognised at DKKm 0 in Roblon’s balance sheet at 31 July 2025. At 31 July 2025, consolidated equity was reduced to DKKm 176.6 and the solvency ratio was reduced by 3.4 percentage points to 71.6% due to the value adjustment of the US subsidiary following the divestment. Roblon has no further liquidity obligations towards the divested US subsidiary. Guidance for 2024/25 Management’s previously announced guidance was that the Company’s revenue and earnings for Q4 would be at a lower level than in Q4 2023/24. This guidance is maintained, based on the lower order book at 31 July 2025 compared with 31 July 2024. Management maintains its most recent full-year guidance announced in Roblon’s interim report for H1 2024/25, although the guided ranges are narrowed as follows: revenue in the range of DKKm 230-250 against the previously guided range of DKKm 220-250 operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items in the range of DKKm 45-50 against the previously guided range of DKKm 40-50 operating profit (EBIT) before special items in the range of DKKm 31-36 against the previously guided range of DKKm 26-36 1 In the interim report, realised amounts for the previous year are stated in brackets.

Tulikivi is revising downward and focusing its earlier estimate of the 2025 net sales and operating profit. The net sales in 2024 were EUR 33.3 million and the comparable operating profit was EUR 2.1 million. According to the new estimate, net sales in 2025 are expected to be EUR 29 to 33 million and the comparable operating profit is expected to be EUR 1 to 2 million. The reason for the lowered outlook is the slower-than-expected recovery in demand in the fireplace market.

För att dra nytta av dessa möjligheter, ytterligare stärka sin konkurrensposition och driva tillväxt i omsättningen avser Bolaget att genomföra den Riktade Nyemissionen. Syftet med den Riktade Nyemissionen är att tillföra de finansiella resurser som krävs för att accelerera FoU-initiativ, stödja go-to-market-investeringar, möjliggöra strategiska investeringar samt optimera Bolagets kapitalstruktur för att säkerställa långsiktig finansiell motståndskraft. Likviden från den Riktade Nyemissionen avses användas enligt följande: (i) Cirka 60 procent – FoU och GTM-acceleration : accelerera nya produkter och kommersialiseringen av pipeline genom utökade FoU- och go-to-market-investeringar. (ii) Cirka 20 procent – strategiska investeringar : investeringar i produktutveckling och kompetensbas för att stärka konkurrenskraft och kundvärde. (iii) Cirka 20 procent – optimering av kapitalstruktur : stärka balansräkningen för att stödja långsiktig tillväxt och öka finansiell flexibilitet. Den Riktade Nyemissionen Den Riktade Nyemissionen avses genomföras med avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt, med stöd av bemyndigandet från årsstämman den 28 maj 2025. Sivers Semiconductors har utsett Pareto Securities AB till Manager för att utreda förutsättningarna att genomföra den Riktade Nyemissionen. Den Riktade Nyemissionen kommer totalt att omfatta aktier motsvarande cirka 90 MSEK. Medlemmar av Bolagets styrelse och ledning, inklusive VD Vickram Vathulya, har indikerat sitt intresse av att delta i den Riktade Nyemissionen. Teckningskursen i den Riktade Nyemissionen kommer att fastställas genom ett accelererat bookbuilding-förfarande som kommer att genomföras av Managern och påbörjas omedelbart efter publiceringen av detta pressmeddelande. Bookbuilding-förfarandet förväntas avslutas innan handeln påbörjas på Nasdaq Stockholm kl. 09.00 CEST den 19 september 2025. Det totala antalet aktier som kan komma att emitteras samt tilldelning i den Riktade Nyemissionen kommer att fastställas av Sivers Semiconductors i samråd med Managern. Bolaget kommer att offentliggöra utfallet av den Riktade Nyemissionen genom ett pressmeddelande efter att bookbuilding-förfarandet har avslutats. Bookbuilding-förfarandet kan, om Bolaget eller Manager så beslutar, komma att förkortas eller förlängas och kan när som helst avbrytas och Bolaget kan således helt eller delvis avstå från att genomföra den Riktade Nyemissionen. Avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt Med anledning av den nu förestående nyemissionen har Bolagets styrelse gjort en samlad bedömning och noga övervägt möjligheten att ta in kapital genom en nyemission med företrädesrätt för Bolagets aktieägare. Styrelsen anser att skälen till att avvika från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt är (i) att diversifiera och förstärka Bolagets aktieägarbas med institutionella investerare i syfte att stärka likviditeten i Bolagets aktie, (ii) att en företrädesemission skulle ta väsentligt längre tid att genomföra och medföra en högre risk för en negativ effekt på aktiekursen, särskilt i ljuset av de nuvarande volatila och utmanande marknadsförutsättningarna, och (iii) att genomförandet av en riktad nyemission kan ske till en lägre kostnad och med mindre komplexitet än en företrädesemission. Med ovanstående i beaktande har styrelsen gjort bedömningen att en riktad emission av stamaktier med avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt är det mest fördelaktiga alternativet för Bolaget för att genomföra kapitalanskaffningen. Eftersom teckningskursen i den Riktade Nyemissionen kommer att fastställas genom ett bookbuilding-förfarande, bedömer styrelsen att teckningskursen kommer att återspegla aktuella marknadsförhållanden och efterfrågan. Lock up-åtaganden Förutsatt att den Riktade Nyemissionen slutförs, har Bolaget åtagit sig att ingå ett lock up-åtagande, med vissa undantag, att inte emittera ytterligare aktier under en period om 180 kalenderdagar efter slutförande av den Riktade Nyemissionen. Därutöver har aktieägande styrelsemedlemmar Bami Bastani, Tomas Duffy, Karin Raj, Todd Thomson och Keith Desmond Halsey samt Bolagets VD Vickram Vathulya, och CFO Heine Thorsgaard åtagit sig att inte sälja några aktier i Bolaget under en period om 90 dagar efter slutförande av den Riktade Nyemissionen, med sedvanliga undantag. Rådgivare Pareto Securities AB agerar Manager och Setterwalls Advokatbyrå AB agerar legal rådgivare till Bolaget i samband med den Riktade Nyemissionen.

Although elevated geopolitical risks increase customers’ need to invest in preparedness, they have also slowed down customers’ decision-making, especially regarding larger orders. Additionally, the Kuwait soil remediation project has progressed more slowly than anticipated. Regarding profitability, the company maintains its previous guidance. On 31 July 2025, the company announced it would accelerate efficiency measures aimed at achieving annual cost savings of EUR 8 million by the end of 2026 compared to the 2024 level. Improved margins and strategic efficiency initiatives will support profitability growth. New guidance for 2025 Revenue is expected to decrease compared to the previous year (2024: EUR 114.4 million). Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase compared to the previous year (2024: EUR 6.4 million). Updated assumptions The guidance is based on the existing order backlog, known tenders and offers submitted, and the management's view on market demand and customer decision-making timeline. The company is currently negotiating several significant equipment sales and medium-sized service contracts in all its market areas. Revenue is expected to be clearly below the comparison period during the third quarter of the year and exceed it clearly during the final quarter. Full year revenue will depend on the accumulation of new orders and delivery schedules during the rest of the year. Revenue from the continuing large service project in Kuwait is expected to be clearly lower compared to the previous year, while the growth of other revenue outside of large service projects is expected to continue. For plastic recycling no revenue is expected during 2025. The company estimates that improved margins and strategic efficiency initiatives will support profitability growth. Driven by the level of revenue, operating profit is expected to be below the comparison period in the third quarter and exceed it in the fourth quarter.

The sNDA for brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline for the treatment of adults with PTSD was accepted for review by the FDA in June 2024 and was based on data from three randomized clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline in adult patients with PTSD. The FDA decision follows the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting on July 18, 2025. The committee voted 1-10 determining that the efficacy of brexpiprazole, when initiated concurrently with sertraline, has not been established for the treatment of PTSD based on the available data presented. Although data from three clinical studies were submitted, the FDA stated in the CRL that not all of these studies are capable of contributing to the substantial evidence of the submission and should Otsuka and Lundbeck be interested in proceeding with the indication, additional positive, adequate and well-controlled trials would be needed to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. “While we respect the FDA’s decision, we continue to believe in the potential of REXULTI in combination with sertraline to help address this serious unmet need,” said John Kraus, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Otsuka. “Otsuka and Lundbeck will take time to review the contents of the letter with the FDA to determine the appropriate path forward.” Johan Luthman, executive vice president of Lundbeck Research & Development, commented. “Post-traumatic stress disorder places a significant and often overlooked burden on patients, their families, and society. We are grateful to the participants, their families, the clinical trial site investigators and staff, and the entire program team for their dedication and commitment to advancing care for those living with PTSD.” This Corporate Release contains inside information and is disclosed in accordance with Article 17 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU, no. 596/2014). About Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States, with approximately five percent of the population affected during a given year.i, ii, iii, iv Most patients (>80%) with PTSD in the United States are in the civilian population. v, vi It may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, series of events or set of circumstances. An individual may experience an event that is emotionally or physically harmful or life-threatening and which may affect mental, physical, social, and/or spiritual well-being. Examples of traumatic events include physical/sexual assault, serious accidents, war/combat, natural disasters, terrorist acts, historical trauma, intimate partner violence and bullying.vii, viii Symptoms of PTSD are generally grouped into four symptom clusters: intrusion (re-experiencing), avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity.ix Individual symptom type and intensity can fluctuate over time and between individuals. The average time from index trauma to symptom presentation is typically 2.2 years, and the average time from index trauma to PTSD diagnosis is typically 8.7 years. To meet the criteria for PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must last longer than one month, and they must be severe enough to interfere with aspects of daily life, such as relationships or work. Symptoms also must not be due to medications, substance use, or another medical condition. Guideline-recommended first-line treatment includes psychotherapy (e.g., trauma-focused cognitive behavioral and processing therapy). Pharmacotherapy with certain antidepressants is recommended when these trauma-focused psychotherapies are not available or feasible when patients prefer medications.x About brexpiprazole Brexpiprazole was approved in the U.S. by the FDA in 2015, as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and as a treatment for schizophrenia in adults. Most recently, brexpiprazole was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, in May 2023. Brexpiprazole has also been approved in more than 60 countries worldwide, including the European Union, Canada and Japan. Brexpiprazole was discovered by Otsuka and is being co-developed by Otsuka and Lundbeck. The mechanism of action of brexpiprazole is unknown. Brexpiprazole has high receptor binding affinity to norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine receptors. It is an antagonist at norepinephrine α1B and α2C receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, as well as a partial agonist at serotonin 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors.xi, xii Contacts Lundbeck Jens Høyer Marie Petterson Vice President, Head of Investor Relations Head of Media Relations, Corp.

The shareholders of Freemelt Holding AB (publ), org.nr 559105-2922 (the ”Company”), are hereby summoned to the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on Wednesday, October 8th 2025 at 11.00 which will be held at the Company’s headquarters located at Fiskhamnsgatan 6A, 414 51 Göteborg. Entry to the EGM takes place from 10:45. The purpose of the extraordinary general meeting is to decide on complementary incentive schemes put forward by the Company’s larger shareholders Stiftelsen Industrifonden, Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön. The reason is that incentives schemes decided upon earlier this year could not be fully implemented due to the strong share price performance this summer. The incentive schemes are directed to senior executives and the Chairman of the Board. They are designed to create long-term incentives that support the Company’s growth and sustainable shareholder value. The right to participate in the Extraordinary General Meeting and registration Shareholders wishing to attend must register their participation no later than October 6th, 2025.

Shareholders who have had their shares registered with a nominee must, in order to be entitled to participate in the meeting, have the shares registered in the shareholder’s own name with Euroclear Sweden AB, so that the person in question is registered as a shareholder in the share register on September 30th, 2025.

Proposed agenda Opening of the meeting and election of chairman and secretary at the meeting; Establishment and approval of the ballot paper; Approval of the agenda; Election of one or two adjusters; Examination of whether the General Meeting has been duly convened; Proposal to implement an incentive scheme for key employees and issuing of warrants in connection therewith; Proposal to implement an incentive scheme for the Board and issuing warrants in connection therewith; Closing of the meeting. Proposed decisions The proposed resolution to item 6 have been proposed by the Company’s Board of Directors. The proposed resolution to item 7 have been proposed by the Company’s shareholder Stiftelsen Industrifonden. Both proposals are supported by the Company’s larger shareholders Stiftelsen Industrifonden, Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön Item 1. Election of chairman of the meeting The Board of Directors proposes Kai Gruner to be elected Chairman of the meeting and that the Company’s CFO Martin Granlund be elected secretary of the meeting. Item 6 – Proposed resolution regarding implementing an incentive scheme for key employees and issuing warrants in connection therewith A. Implementing an incentive scheme The Board propose, supported by the Company’s larger shareholders Stiftelsen Industrifonden, Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön, that the general meeting resolve to establish a long-term incentive scheme for key employees in the Company and its subsidiaries (the "" Group "") through the issuance of warrants ("" Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028 ""). The proposal aims to create conditions to strengthen the motivation of employees that the Group has identified as important and trusted in the short and long term. The Board considers that an incentive scheme according to the present proposal is beneficial for the Group and the Company's shareholders. B. Participants and allotment of Employee Stock Options within Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028 The Board proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following terms and conditions for the allocation of employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "") within the framework of Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028. (1) The Employee Stock Options shall be allocated to key employees and senior executives in the Company (each a ""Participant""). Not more than 9,945,529 Employee Stock Options will be issued. The board shall resolve on allocation based on experience, ability, and performance. (2) Allotment of the Employee Stock Options shall take place no later than October 14th, 2025. The Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge. Only employees who are part of the aforementioned categories shall be offered the right to be awarded Employee Stock Options, provided that they have entered into a separate agreement regarding Employee Stock Options with the Company. (3) Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) warrant in the Company that has been issued in accordance with section C below and which shall be transferred from the Company’s subsidiary to the Participant in accordance with section D. (4) The Participant will be able to exercise allocated and vested Employee Stock Options from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. Allocated Employee Stock Options may only be used to acquire warrants if the Participant is still employed by the Company. (5) The Board shall be responsible for managing Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028 within the framework of the main terms and conditions stated above. C. Issuance of warrants To enable the Board's proposal according to B above, the Board proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue no more than 9,945,529 warrants, entailing an increase of the Company’s share capital when fully exercised by not more than SEK 497,276.45 (calculated on a quota value of SEK 0.05). The following terms and conditions shall apply to the resolution. (1) The right to subscribe for the warrants shall, with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right, vest in the company's subsidiary, Freemelt AB (the "" Subsidiary ""), with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to the Participant according to section B above. (2) The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the warrants shall be able to be used for the implementation of Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028. (3) The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. (4) Subscription of the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list within seven days of the general meeting's resolution. (5) The Board has the right to extend the subscription period. (6) Each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the Company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. (7) The subscription price for the shares upon exercise of the warrants shall amount to SEK 2.50. (8) Shares which are newly issued following subscription shall entitle the holder to a dividend at the first record date for the dividend following the date which occurs after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered into the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB. (9) Warrants that are held by the Subsidiary and that have not been transferred in accordance with section B above may be cancelled by the Company following a decision by the Company’s Board of directors. Cancellation shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The warrants shall in addition to the above be subject to the terms and conditions set out in “Villkor för teckningsoptioner av Serie E 2025/2028 i Freemelt Holding AB (publ)”. The terms and conditions will inter alia show that the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription can be recalculated in case of, inter alia, new issues of shares and bonus issues. D. Approval of transfer of warrants (1) The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall accrue to the Participant, provided that the Participant is still employed. (2) One (1) Employee Stock Option gives the right to acquire one (1) warrant. Notification of the acquisition of warrants must take place during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. The warrants are acquired free of charge by the Participant. (3) In connection with the notification of the acquisition of warrants, the Participant shall submit an irrevocable power of attorney to a representative of the Company authorizing the representative to, in the Participant's name and on his/her behalf, immediately after the Subsidiary transfers the warrant to the Participant, use the received warrants to subscribe for shares in the Company. E. Further information regarding the incentive scheme (1) Dilution The conversion of warrants will happen through a so called “net exercise” which means the actual dilution as a consequence of the incentive scheme will be lower than what is indicated by its nominal size. Without “net exercise” the maximum number of new shares at full subscription would be 9,945,529, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 5.0 percent calculated on the number of shares after full subscription, subject, however, to the recalculation of the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription of. Dilution of 5.0 percent is a theoretical maximum that will not be achieved within the “net exercise” design. Exact dilution will depend on the share price at conversion in relation to the exercise price. If, for example, the share price at the conversion day is a) three times, or b) four times, or c) six times higher than the exercise price, the dilution will be approximately a) 0.3 percent, b) 0.4 percent and c) 0.4 percent. (2) Costs for the Company It is the opinion of the Board that the Employee Stock Options at expiry can result in costs for the Company in the form of wage costs, social security costs and some minor consultancy and administrative costs related to the incentive scheme. Based on an assumed share price of SEK 1.94 at the time of subscription, an assumed exercise price of SEK 2.50, an expected term of 3.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.966 percent, an assumed volatility of 47.5 percent and no expected dividend during the term, the value (for accounting purposes of wages and social security costs) of each Employee Stock Option has been calculated to SEK 0.499 and SEK 5.0 million for all Employee Stock Options in Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028. If there is a positive share price development, assuming a share price of SEK 5.00, assuming that all Employee Stock Options have been subscribed to and that they are all being exercised to acquire 5,022,994 shares after applying “net exercise”, assuming that average social security costs are 31.42 percent, then Incitamentsprogram E2025/2028 will result in accounting costs totalling SEK 24,863,823 and social security costs totalling SEK 7,812,213. Above calculations are preliminary. The purpose is to present an example regarding potential costs that the incentive scheme can lead to. Actual costs may deviate from what is stated above. The incentive scheme is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company’s key figures. (3) Preparation of the proposal The principles for the incentive scheme have been worked out by the Board, and it has support from the Company’s largest shareholders. The proposal has been prepared with the support of external advisors. The Board has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the EGM. (4) Other incentive schemes The Company has current incentive schemes that includes a total of 10,393,410 warrants which combined gives the right to subscribe for 10,412,850 shares in the Company. The total dilution according to these schemes amounts to 5.2 percent based on the number of shares after full subscription and without consideration taken to the “net exercise” structure applicable to the majority of outstanding warrants. The maximum dilution from incentive schemes implemented in year 2020 is 0.1 percent, from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2024 is 0.0 percent and from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2025 is 5.1 percent. The calculation is based on the number of shares after full subscription. Within incentive schemes implemented in year 2025, a total of 8,719,467 warrants remain which have not been acquired by a participant. These will be cancelled which has been considered in the above dilution calculation. (5) Majority requirement The Board, or a person appointed by the Board, shall be authorized to make the minor changes in the resolution that may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB. The proposals, according to A-E, shall be treated and seen as one and the same resolution. The EGM's resolution regarding this item is valid only if it is supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. Item 7 – Proposed resolution regarding implementing an incentive scheme for the Board and issuing warrants in connection therewith A. Implementing an incentive scheme Shareholder Stiftelsen Industrifonden propose, supported by the Company’s larger shareholders Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön, that the general meeting resolve to establish a long-term incentive scheme for Board members in the Company and its subsidiaries (the "" Group "") through the issuance of so-called qualified employee stock options in accordance with Ch. 11a. of the Swedish Income Tax Act (1999:1229) ("" Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 "") and issuance of options ("" Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 ""). The proposal aims to create conditions to strengthen the motivation of Board members. Stiftelsen Industrifonden considers that an incentive scheme according to the present proposal is beneficial for the Group and the Company's shareholders. B. Participants and allotment of Employee Stock Options within Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 Stiftelsen Industrifonden proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following terms and conditions for the allocation of qualified employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "") within the framework of Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028. (1) The Employee Stock Options shall be allocated to the Chairman of the Board (the ""Participant""). Not more than 943,778 Employee Stock Options will be issued, conditional that the total number of warrants in both incentive schemes do not exceed 943,778 (as set out in section D). (2) Allotment of the Employee Stock Options shall take place no later than October 14th, 2025. The Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge. Only a Participant who is part of the aforementioned categories shall be offered the right to be awarded Employee Stock Options, provided that they have entered into a separate agreement regarding Employee Stock Options with the Company. (3) Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) warrant in the Company that has been issued in accordance with section D below and which shall be transferred from the Company’s subsidiary to the Participant in accordance with section E. (4) The Participant will be able to exercise allocated and vested Employee Stock Options from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. Allocated Employee Stock Options may only be used to acquire warrants if the Participant is still a Board member or employed. (5) Stiftelsen Industrifonden shall be responsible for managing Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 within the framework of the main terms and conditions stated above. C. Participants and allotment of options within Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 Stiftelsen Industrifonden proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following terms and conditions for the allocation of options ("" TO D "") within the framework of Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028. (1) The TO D shall be allocated to the Chairman of the Board (the ""Participant""). Not more than 943,778 TO D will be issued, conditional that the total number of warrants in both incentive schemes do not exceed 943,778 (as set out in section D). (2) Allotment of the TO D shall take place no later than October 14th, 2025. Payment of the options premium shall take place within two weeks of subscription. The TO D price will be set using an established valuation methodology, such as Black & Scholes valuation model, to ensure a valuation in accordance with market terms. Only the Chairman of the Board shall be offered the right to subscribe to TO D, provided that the Participant has entered into a separate agreement regarding TO D with the Company. At subscription, the Company shall retain the right to repurchase TO D in situations such as the Participant ending his/her Board engagement or employment, or if the Participant wishes to pass on the TO D to a third party. (3) Each TO D entitles the holder to acquire one (1) warrant in the Company that has been issued in accordance with section D below and which shall be transferred from the Company’s subsidiary to the Participant in accordance with section E. (4) The Participant will be able to exercise allocated and vested TO D from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. (5) Stiftelsen Industrifonden shall be responsible for managing the Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 within the framework of the main terms and conditions stated above. D. Issuance of warrants To enable Stifelsen Industrifonden’s proposal according to B and C above, Stiftelsen Industrifonden proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue no more than 943,778 warrants, entailing an increase of the Company’s share capital when fully exercised by not more than SEK 47,188.90 (calculated on a quota value of SEK 0.05). The following terms and conditions shall apply to the resolution. (1) The right to subscribe for the warrants shall, with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right, vest in the company's subsidiary, Freemelt AB (the "" Subsidiary ""), with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to the Participant according to section B and C above. (2) The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the warrants shall be able to be used for the implementation of the Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 and Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028. (3) The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. (4) Subscription of the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list within seven days of the general meeting's resolution. (5) Stiftelsen Industrifonden has the right to extend the subscription period. (6) Each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the Company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. (7) The subscription price for the shares upon exercise of the warrants shall amount to SEK 2.50. (8) Shares which are newly issued following subscription shall entitle the holder to a dividend at the first record date for the dividend following the date which occurs after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered into the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB. (9) Warrants that are held by the Subsidiary and that have not been transferred in accordance with section B and C above may be cancelled by the Company following a decision by the Company’s Board of directors. Cancellation shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The warrants shall in addition to the above be subject to the terms and conditions set out in “Villkor för teckningsoptioner av Serie C & D 2025/2028 i Freemelt Holding AB (publ)”. The terms and conditions will inter alia show that the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription can be recalculated in case of, inter alia, new issues of shares and bonus issues. E. Approval of transfer of warrants (1) The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall accrue to the Participant, provided that the Participant is still a Board member or an employee of the Company (and that other prerequisites for qualified employee stock options according to the Sweden Income Tax Act are met regarding Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028). (2) One (1) Employee Stock Option gives the right to acquire one (1) warrant and one (1) TO D gives the right to acquire one (1) warrant. Notification of the acquisition of warrants must take place during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. The warrants are acquired free of charge by the Participant. (3) In connection with the notification of the acquisition of warrants, the Participant shall submit an irrevocable power of attorney to a representative of the Company authorizing the representative to, in the Participant's name and on his/her behalf, immediately after the Subsidiary transfers the warrant to the Participant, use the received warrants to subscribe for shares in the Company. F. Further information regarding the incentive scheme (1) Dilution The conversion of warrants will happen through a so called “net exercise” which means the actual dilution as a consequence of the incentive schemes will be lower than what is indicated by its nominal size. Without “net exercise” the maximum number of new shares at full subscription in both schemes would be 943,778, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 0.5 percent calculated using the number of shares after full subscription, subject, however, to the recalculation of the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription of. Dilution of 0.5 percent is a theoretical maximum that will not be achieved within the “net exercise” design. Exact dilution will depend on the share price at conversion in relation to the exercise price. If, for example, the share price at the conversion day is a) three times, or b) four times, or c) six times higher than the exercise price, the dilution will be approximately a) 0.3 percent, b) 0.4 percent and c) 0.4 percent. (2) Costs for the Company It is the assessment of the Company’s advisors that the tax regulations for qualified employee stock options according to Ch. 11a of the Sweden Income Tax Act is applicable to the Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028. It is further assessed that the Participant will acquire securities at market terms within Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 and consequently there is no taxable benefit as set out in the Sweden Income Tax Act or the Act on Social Fees. Taking this into account, the Company's costs for Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 and Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 are calculated to only consist of costs for the preparation, implementation and administration of the schemes as well as guidance of the tax situation. (3) Preparation of the proposal The principles for the incentive schemes have been worked out by Stiftelsen Industrifonden, and it has support from the Company’s larger shareholders Coeli Fonder, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön. The proposal has been prepared with the support of external advisors. Stiftelsen Industrifonden has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the EGM. Board members have not been involved in setting the terms. (4) Other incentive schemes The Company has current incentive schemes that includes a total of 10,393,410 warrants which combined gives the right to subscribe for 10,412,850 shares in the Company. The total dilution according to these schemes amounts to 5.2 percent based on the number of shares after full subscription and without consideration taken to the “net exercise” structure applicable to the majority of outstanding warrants. The maximum dilution from incentive schemes implemented in year 2020 is 0.1 percent, from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2024 is 0.0 percent and from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2025 is 5.1 percent. The calculation is based on the number of shares after full subscription. Within incentive schemes implemented in year 2025, a total of 8,719,467 warrants remain which have not been acquired by a participant. These will be cancelled which has been considered in the above dilution calculation. (5) Majority requirement The Board, or a person appointed by the Board, shall be authorized to make the minor changes in the resolution that may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB. The proposals, according to A-E, shall be treated and seen as one and the same resolution.

The company is also updating its medium-term financial targets. ""Synsam’s journey has only begun. In a growing market featuring attractive drivers, we are meeting customer needs with our strong concepts and look forward to continued profitable growth in the Nordic region. Synsam is continuing to lead developments in the industry,"" says Håkan Lundstedt, President and CEO of Synsam Group. Synsam Lifestyle – a subscription for all stages of life Since its launch, the Synsam Lifestyle subscription service has become a popular solution that offers security for our customers. Today, Synsam Lifestyle subscriptions account for 53% of Synsam’s sales, which confirms the power of combining innovation with customer insight. The customer base is growing strongly, and as of June 2025 there was a total of approximately 871,000 subscription customers, of whom about 730,000 are Synsam Lifestyle subscription customers. Synsam has an advantage after developing the Synsam Lifestyle subscription service for many years, and the aim is to accelerate. Synsam’s ambition is to grow the subscription customer base to a total of 1,210,000 subscription customers – of whom 1,010,000 Synsam Lifestyle subscription customers – by 2029. Store establishments driving growth Synsam has the most attractive stores, both locally and in the wider market. Synsam offers the widest and most desirable range – always optimised to meet the customer’s needs. Synsam’s store establishment strategy means that new stores achieve profitability quickly, which demonstrates both the robustness of Synsam’s concept and the skills of Synsam’s employees. Common features of all establishments are that Synsam always follows the most recent version of its leading concept, right-sizing the assortment and enhancing the customer offering – Synsam should always be “Best in Town.” The target from 2026 is to reduce the payback for new store establishments from the previous average of just over 3 years to 2.5 years. Synsam completed a total of 200 new store establishments and upgrades to Mega Stores between 2021 and June 2025. The previously communicated target of opening 90 new stores between 2024 and 2026 remains firm. For 2027–2029, the target is 80 new stores and 30 upgrades to Mega Stores. The targets for new establishments in 2027–2029 are about 40–60 in Sweden, about 10–20 in Finland and about 10–20 in Norway. The targets for upgrades to Mega Stores are about 10–20 in Denmark, about 5–10 in Sweden and about 5–10 in Norway. Synsam EyeView – technology that boosts capacity and accessibility There has been a general shortage of opticians in the optical retail sector for quite some time, primarily in regions of Sweden and Norway, which in some cases has limited our ability to grow and meet customer demand. Synsam EyeView – with technology, optometric assistants and opticians working together – means that customers have access to more high-quality eye examinations. Synsam EyeView also allows Synsam to establish a presence in areas where there is a shortage of opticians. Synsam EyeView has been fully implemented in Norway and Sweden, and the number of stores with Synsam EyeView in other markets is gradually increasing. Of the total number of eye examinations in the first half of 2025, 13% were performed using Synsam EyeView in Sweden and 20% in Norway. The percentage of eye examinations performed using Synsam EyeView is expected to increase in the next few years, and Synsam’s long-term aim is that every other eye examination in Sweden and Norway will be performed with Synsam EyeView. Synsam House Brands are a key component of Synsam’s success Synsam House Brands serve as a cornerstone for building an attractive assortment and account for about 50% of the volume of frames sold. Over the next six months, Synsam will also enhance the assortment of House Brands by adding several new brands and collections. The Synsam Production and Innovation Centre in Sweden has positive EBITDA. Production is now increasing and will reach 100,000 pairs of frames manufactured in 2025, and more than 250,000 pairs of frames are expected to be manufactured in 2028. Increased efficiency and profitability are expected as production volumes increase. Smart glasses – combined with professional optical retail services The development of smart glasses is accelerating, with Synsam playing a key role in their growth in the Nordic region. By combining its optical expertise, style and advice with the new technology, Synsam serves an important function in a rapidly growing business area. Synsam Group updates its financial targets Synsam Group is updating its profitability target and adding an investment target. The profitability target is changed to EBIT margin, which better reflects the financial results of Synsam Group, than the earlier EBITDA margin target, especially when taking into account the large investments which Synsam Group has performed during the last years. The target regarding investments is relevant for Synsam Group, as large investments have been performed the last years, and as investments to a large extent affect the cash flow of Synsam Group. Synsam Group’s financial targets are as follows: Growth rate – Synsam Group targets annual organic growth of 8–12% in the medium term, depending on the pace of greenfield expansion Profitability – Synsam Group targets an annual EBIT margin of 12–15% in the medium term Investments – Synsam Group targets an annual investments / net sales ratio of 3% in the medium term, excluding acquisitions Capital structure – Synsam Group targets a net debt / adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5x, excluding temporary deviations Dividend policy – Synsam Group aims to pay dividends of 40–60% of the net profit for the year Presentation material and recording of the Capital Markets Day The presentation material and a recording of the presentations held at the Capital Markets Day will be available afterwards on the Synsam Group website.

Nulägesrapporten kan läsas i sin helhet nedan. Den senaste månaden har varit den mest framgångsrika i Fluicells historia. Dels har vi beviljats finansiering ifrån Breakthrough T1D inom vårt diabetesprogram, vilket är den starkaste valideringen av vår plattform Nexocyte som vi hittills fått. Därtill har vi ingått ett licensavtal med Ambusol där vi ser en tydlig synergi mellan vår teknik och Ambusols behandlingsmetod inom glioblastom, en cancerform där det idag finns få fungerande behandlingsalternativ. Vi har dessutom mottagit en order avseende Biopixlar från The Francis Crick Institute, en av de främsta biovetenskapliga forskningsinstitutionerna i Europa. Dessa framsteg demonstrerar tydligt den mångfald av tillväxtmöjligheter som Nexocyte skapar för Fluicell. Utöver dessa framsteg undersöker Bolaget möjligheter att under 2026 vidareutveckla ny spännande teknik baserad på Fluicells IP i en separat struktur. Slutligen pågår det även ett antal ytterligare affärsdiskussioner. En anledning till att vi idag ser betydande framsteg är den affärsutvecklingsgrupp med seniora ledare som jag tillsammans med styrelsen skapat och vars arbete varit mycket framgångsrikt. Fluicell har idag stora möjligheter att avancera på flera fronter. Med världsledande forskare och fokus på affärsutveckling arbetar vi nu för att tillvarata Bolagets alla möjligheter och att maximera aktieägarvärde. Partnerskap med Ambusol genererar intäkter kopplat till teknik för drug delivery Ambusol är ett bolag med ett unikt tillvägagångssätt för att behandla cancer som bygger på mångårig forskning av Professor Gunnar Ronquist vid Uppsala universitet. Genom det licensavtal som kommunicerades den 2 september förenar vi Ambusols metod och erfarenhet med Fluicells spjutspetsteknik för att skapa nya sätt att behandla cancer. Avtalet med Ambusol omfattar fem cancerindikationer med ett initialt fokus på glioblastom, en aggressiv form av hjärncancer där Ambusols behandlingsmetod redan visat på stor potential i kliniska prövningar. Avtalet tillför Fluicell värde på flera olika plan i form av fasta och rörliga intäkter på lång och kort sikt. Dels erhåller Fluicell löpande licensavgifter till ett sammanlagt värde om 29 MSEK, uppdelat på årliga betalningar. Fluicell kommer också erhålla betalning för den utveckling som vi kommer att bedriva för att anpassa Fluicells teknik till Ambusols behandlingsmetod, vilket kommer utgöra en viktig inkomstkälla som stärker Fluicells kassaflöde i närtid och minskar Bolagets kapitaliseringsbehov. Utöver detta kommer utvecklingsmässiga och kommersiella milstolpsbetalningar till ett sammanlagt värde om 111,5 MSEK, knutna till de fem olika cancerindikationer som ingår i avtalet, samt royalties på framtida produktförsäljning. Fluicell kommer inte heller bära några kostnader i projektet. Sammantaget utgör detta avtal ett viktigt steg i Fluicells kommersiella utveckling som genererar intäkter såväl i närtid som på lång sikt och som även utökar vår verksamhet till att tillhandahålla unika tekniska lösningar för drug delivery inom det enskilt största sjukdomsområdet sett till globalt marknadsvärde. Vi har nu i september påbörjat arbete i projektet. Banbrytande diabetessamarbete med Breakthrough T1D och Mayo Clinic Den 11 september hade vi den stora glädjen att berätta att vår partner i vårt Breakthrough T1D-finansierade projekt inom typ 1-diabetes är sjukhuset Mayo Clinic i Rochester och diabetesforskaren Dr. Quinn Peterson. Mayo Clinic i Rochester har toppat Newsweek/Statistas ranking av världens bästa sjukhus sedan undersökningen påbörjades 2019 och är utöver detta även ansett som nummer ett inom diabetesforskning i USA. Att Mayo Clinic och Breakthrough T1D, som är ansett som världens främsta organisation med fokus på typ 1-diabetes, väljer att inleda ett samarbete med Fluicell är både ett kraftfullt erkännande av det värde som vår teknik tillför och en betydande möjlighet för oss att ta avgörande steg framåt i vår utveckling av vävnadsbaserade terapier i riktning mot klinik. Samarbetet med dessa två framstående organisationer stärker Fluicells ställning på marknaden på ett sätt som ökar våra möjligheter till ytterligare affärsöverenskommelser och partnerskap. Stärkt ställning för Nexocyte genom ökad instrumentförsäljning Parallellt med det tecknade licensavtalet med Ambusol och den beviljade projektfinansieringen från Breakthrough T1D har även Nexocytes ställning som forskningsplattform fortsatt att stärkas. Ett exempel är försäljningen av ett Biopixlar-system till det framstående forskningsinstitutet The Francis Crick Institute demonstrerar på ett tydligt sätt det värde som Fluicells teknik tillför spjutspetsforskning inom biologi och medicin. Försäljningen visar också på den stora bredd som finns i Fluicells affärsmodell. Försäljning av forskningsinstrument utgör ett viktigt komplement till våra huvudfokusområden som diversifierar våra intäktsströmmar och som bidrar till att stärka Fluicells varumärke och ställning på våra nyckelmarknader. Vi ser Biopixlar som en teknik som ligger före sin tid och vi tror att den upprepade försäljningen till elitlab vi nu sett har goda förutsättningar att skapa ringar på vattnet med nya kunder som efterföljare. Rent generellt ser vi just nu en positiv trend på labtechmarknaden efter den nedgång som präglat tiden efter covid 19-pandemin vilket också skapar möjligheter till ytterligare försäljning. Nya möjligheter bortom Fluicell Tack vare den omfattande mångsidigheten i Fluicells plattform identifierar vi regelbundet nya möjliga tillämpningar där vår teknik antingen kan erbjuda påtagliga fördelar eller till och med göra sådant som tidigare ansetts omöjligt. Vi har under en tid, vid sidan av våra reguljära projekt, vidareutvecklat en sådan möjlighet med stor genombrottspotential inom området biologisk screening. Det är vår bedömning att de bästa förutsättningarna att tillvarata denna potential och maximera aktieägarvärde ges om vidareutvecklingen av denna screeningteknik sker i en separat struktur utanför Fluicells ordinarie verksamhet. Under de kommande sex till tolv månaderna kommer vi därför att driva en process för att utvärdera olika alternativ, där etablerandet av ett nytt bolag baserat på teknologin är ett möjligt scenario. Målsättningen med denna process är att både generera nya intäktsströmmar för Fluicell och skapa optimala förutsättningar att lansera en teknik som sträcker sig bortom vår nuvarande kapacitet. Fluicell har ett team, en teknik och en ip-portfölj med omfattande djup och bredd samt ett flertal spelpjäser till vårt förfogande som ger oss möjlighet att bedriva affärsutveckling med ett strategiskt perspektiv. Jag kan därför konstatera att vi just nu befinner oss i en mycket spännande tid för Fluicell.

Exsitec is already a valued partner in the Swedish and Norwegian markets. In exchange for Exsitec’s new comprehensive partner status as a fully-fledged service provider, Konsolidator receives a fixed fee against a 4-year-increasing ARR model to Exsitec. This move is another step in the 2025-2027 Resilient Growth strategy as Konsolidator expects lower churn and higher aggregate revenues from Exsitec and the Swedish and Norwegian end-users going forward. Niklas Ek, Group CEO at Exsitec AB, explains : “This deal confirms our strategic investment in our business area. Konsolidator fits perfectly into our portfolio and complements our offerings within business intelligence. We look forward to helping our new customers get real value from digital tools that truly make a difference”. Claus Finderup Grove, CEO of Konsolidator, agrees and continues : Adding customer success to the partner value chain is the last step in creating an entirely partner-driven business model in Sweden and Norway. Exsitec understands our customers and shares our vision of making CFOs better, not least by providing them with more reliable data through our SaaS-based software. I do not doubt that this deal will expand our reach, reduce costs, and scale faster than the existing modus operandi.” This will not affect guidance as the ARR is unaffected in 2025.

With this decision, AcadeMedia now has a pipeline of approximately 2,000–2,500 new preschool places in regions with strong demand. Today, AcadeMedia operates 103 preschools in Germany, offering 8,400 preschool places. Since entering the German market in 2017, the company’s expansion strategy has focused on organic growth, with a target of 10–15 new openings per year. The newly approved preschool places will be established over the next three years. The need for preschool places in Germany remains substantial, with an estimated shortage of around 300,000 places. Access to preschool has a major impact on both the labor market and gender equality in the country. Despite ongoing expansion of preschool capacity, only 37 percent of children under the age of three are currently enrolled. AcadeMedia therefore sees strong potential for continued growth in the coming years, both through new establishments and acquisitions. “The demand for more preschools in Germany remains very high. Our expansion helps address this important societal need while also showcasing AcadeMedia’s strong ability to grow sustainably and organically over the long term,” says Kristofer Hammar, Director of Business Development at AcadeMedia.

See note 5. Comments by Daniel Ervér, CEO The positive sales trend continued in the third quarter. Sales increased by 2 percent in local currencies during the period, while at the same time the number of stores decreased by 4 percent at the end of the quarter compared with the same point in time last year. Through a stronger customer offering, an improved gross margin and good cost control, we have strengthened operating profit compared with the same quarter last year. The increase in profit shows that we are on the right track as a result of the progress we have made in our plan. This is also reflected in the reception we received on the launch of H&M in Brazil in August. With the H&M brand’s global strength and a locally relevant customer offering, we have taken an important step into a large fashion market. We see good potential to grow both in Brazil and elsewhere in Latin America. In September we opened a new flagship store in Le Marais, Paris, with a specially curated assortment, presentation and interior design concept.

Nu firar Picadeli över 300 salladsbarer i Finland vilket gör Picadeli till en av de största snabbmatskedjorna i landet sett till antal försäljningsställen. Sedan Picadeli lanserades i Finland 2013 har konceptet vuxit från några få salladsbarer i Helsingfors till att omfatta hela landet. Idag syns de gröna skålarna överallt från storstädernas livsmedelsbutiker till skidorter långt uppe i Lappland. Hälften av salladsbarerna ligger utanför Helsingforsregionen, vilket tydligt visar att efterfrågan finns både i storstäder och mindre orter. – Vår resa i Finland är en fantastisk del av en ännu större tillväxtresa. Picadeli växer snabbt, inte bara i Norden utan också på flera europeiska marknader och i USA. Att vi nu har över 300 salladsbarer i Finland visar vilken kraft konceptet har och vi ser en enorm potential att fortsätta göra hälsosam snabbmat lättillgänglig för ännu fler människor, säger David von Laskowski, vd och koncernchef för Picadeli och Greenfood Group. Bakom framgången ligger en enkel insikt: hälsosam mat måste vara lättillgänglig, prisvärd och god annars väljer människor den bort. Picadeli arbetar därför ständigt med att förnya sortimentet med nya, spännande ingredienser och smaker som lockar både unga och äldre. Samtidigt är teknologin en avgörande del av konceptet. Det som för ögat ser ut som en vanlig salladsbar är i själva verket en svensk foodtech-innovation. Picadelis uppkopplade kyldiskar drivs av AI och algoritmer som analyserar lagernivåer, försäljningshistorik, planogram och till och med väderprognoser. På så sätt kan butiker beställa exakt det kunderna vill ha samtidigt som matsvinnet minimeras och utbudet alltid är relevant. Teknologin gör det också möjligt att växa i snabb takt utan att kompromissa med hållbarhet. En genomsnittlig Picadelisallad har ett koldioxidavtryck på 0,9 kilo, nästan hälften av en europeisk standardlunch som i snitt släpper ut 1,48 kilo. Picadeli är en del av svenska Greenfood Group, en pionjär inom hälsosam mat i Europa. Konceptet finns idag i Sverige, Frankrike, Monaco, Belgien, Luxemburg, Tyskland, Finland, Danmark, Estland och USA. Sammanlagt säljs över 70 miljoner hälsosamma måltider varje år. Magnus Holtinger Wallin Head of Communications Om Greenfood Greenfood är en ledande europeisk aktör som skapar hälsosam och hållbar mat som är god, prisvärd och lättillgänglig. Från Picadelis digitaliserade salladsbar och färdigrätter, till frukt och grönt direkt från odlingar spridda över en stor del av världen. Genom våra tre affärsområden tillhandahåller Greenfood färsk, hälsosam växtbaserad mat i olika stadier av förädling till kunder inom dagligvaruhandeln, samt hotell, restaurang och catering. År 2024 uppgick Greenfoods omsättning till 5,6 miljarder SEK. Greenfood har verksamhet i 11 länder med huvudkontor i det historiska hjärtat av verksamheten: Helsingborg, Sverige. I Greenfoods portfölj finns flera starka varumärken, till exempel: Picadeli, Daily Greens, SallaCarte, Green Deli och Ahlgood. Läs mer på .

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that C3.ai and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm urges investors in C3.ai who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. C3.ai, Inc. (AI) Securities Class Action: According to the complaint, filed under the caption Liggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuit alleges that these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive. The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%. The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later than October 21, 2025. “We’re focused on whether C3.ai’s public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health was affecting the company’s ability to close deals and meet financial targets,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

ThinkCareBelieve's article is a compliation of this week's events sourcing a collection of articles, videos, notable quotes, images, notes and insights that mark this week as being unique to America's Journey into the Golden Age. The stories that developed this week are shaping a brighter, stronger, greater America. There is no doubt that we have becoming wiser and stronger. Week 36 began with a Grand Memorial honoring Charlie Kirk, a beloved Christian Patiriot who was taken from us way too early by assassin's bullet. Charlie's legacy lives on with surging interest in starting new chapters of Turning Point USA, skyrocketing Bible sales and beautiful connection/reconnection of people with churches. The article also covers President Trump's Address to the United Nations General Assembly this week with an historic Address announcing decisive efforts to halt nuclear/bioweapons programs and global human trafficking. President Trump then had Pull-Aside meetings with the leaders of EU, Argentia, France, Uzbekastan, Ukraine and the Secretary of the UN General Assembly. The article covers President Trump's announcement of an FDA Advisory on the use of Tylenol/Acetamiophen for mothers during pregnancy and for babies when given vaccines. Caution for the use of Tylenol during pregnancy is supported by the company that makes Tylenol. The Head of the FDA announced that the FDA is filing a federal register notice to change the label on an exciting treatment called prescription Leucovorin which may be able to help children with Autism. Some clinicians have reported that Leucovorin has demonstrated some improvements in autism speech symptoms. The War on Terrorism ramped up this week with President Trump signing an NSPM, a National Security Presidential Memorandum for the first-ever comprehensie national counter-terrorism strategy to uproot the domestic terrorism networks on American soil. ThinkCareBelieve's shows that Peace may finally come to the Middle East with the unveiling of President Trump's 21-point plan to end the conflict in Gaza and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff stating that he expects to have a breakthrough in the next few days. President Trump is the President of Peace. The article has the newest indicators of the strengthening U.S. economy with new home sales being much higher than expected and the third and final revision for 2Q 2025 GDP even better than expected. President Trump worked his ""Egg Magic"" on the U.S. economy and it is paying off eggxactly as planned. Secretary Kennedy is addressing the corruption involved in organ transplants and that important announcement is included in the article. America is getting on track to being healthy again with the swearing in of Dr. Ben Carson as our National Nutrition Advisor. An important update to the number of Missing Children found in the U.S. is 30,000 of the still over 300,000 children still missing. Efforts are still underway and ThinkCareBelieve has made a plea for Americans in the article to call their Representatives on behalf of aiding law enforcement efforts to find and rescue the children. Read the Call Initiative: ThinkCareBelieve is an outlook. ThinkCareBelieve’s mission for Peace advocacy facilitates positive outcomes and expanded possibilities. To achieve Peace, we will find the commonalities between diverse groups and bring the focus on common needs, working together toward shared goals. Activism is an important aspect of ThinkCareBelieve, because public participation and awareness to issues needing exposure to light leads to justice. Improved transparency in government can lead to changes in policy and procedure resulting in more fluid communication between the public and the government that serves them. America needs hope right now, and Americans need to be more involved in their government. ###"

SO WHAT: If you purchased Fluor securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Fluor class action, go to or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) costs associated with the Gordie Howe International Bridge (“Gordie Howe”), the Interstate 365 Lyndon B. Johnson (“I-635/LBJ”) and Interstate 35E (“I-35”) highways in Texas projects were growing because of, inter alia, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (2) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on Fluor’s business and financial results; (3) accordingly, Fluor’s financial guidance for the full year 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of Fluor’s risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on Fluor’s business and financial results was understated; and (4) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

NEW YORK, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- What’s Happening: - Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). - Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Allegation Details: - According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. - On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” - Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

The suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, comes after a dramatic stock price decline in August following the company’s earnings report. Video: The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. - Class Period: May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 27, 2025 - Contact the Firm Now: - Phone: 844-916-0895 - Email: - Website Form: LifeMD, Inc. (LFMD) Securities Class Action: The lawsuit, captioned Johnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7 and August 5, 2025. It alleges that LifeMD made false and misleading statements, particularly on May 6, 2025, when it reported its first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The complaint claims that the company’s optimistic outlook, which cited a “category-defining competitive moat” in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand, was false as it misleadingly failed to account for crucial business challenges. The suit contends that LifeMD was experiencing rising customer acquisition costs in its RexMD segment and a higher-than-anticipated refund rate in its weight management business, issues that it did not disclose to investors at the time. The alleged deception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings per share estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance. During the earnings call, management cited ""temporary elevated customer acquisition costs"" for its RexMD business and issues with patient refunds for its weight management offerings. The following day, LifeMD's stock price plummeted by over 44%. For investors who suffered substantial losses during this period, the lawsuit represents an opportunity to recover damages. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Hagens Berman, a national plaintiffs’ rights firm, is investigating these claims. “We’re investigating whether LifeMD knew of but failed to disclose key operational problems,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Management invites investors and stakeholders to a webinar on Friday, 26 September 2025 at 10:30 CET, where the the annual report will be presented. Register here: Mdundo.com A/S strengthened its position as one of Africa’s leading music services in FY 2024/25, reaching 40.5 million monthly active users and launching new partnerships with major telecom operators and payment providers. While the year was affected by billing challenges and a weaker advertising market, management took firm steps to reduce costs and streamline operations. With a leaner organisation, growing subscription revenues, and strong fundamentals in Africa’s digital music market, the company remains confident in its long-term growth potential and ability to deliver value to shareholders. Highlights: User Growth: Monthly active users (MAUs) grew 12.5% to 40.5 million, surpassing the company’s target of 40 million. Subscription Growth: Subscription revenue increased by 18% year-on-year, despite billing challenges with two major telecom partners. New partnerships with MTN Cameroon and Vodacom South Africa were launched, alongside wallet-based billing through Opera MiniPay. Advertising Decline: Advertising revenue fell by 51% as a result of declining CPMs in African markets, particularly Nigeria. Financial Performance: Revenue for the year amounted to DKK 11.0 million (2023/24: DKK 11.9 million). EBITDA ended at DKK -5.5 million (2023/24: DKK -6.4 million). EBITDA is influenced by a one-off provision made during the audit process in relation to account receivables (-0.4 million) Cash Position: Year-end cash stood at DKK 4.7 million (DKK 5.5 million including funds held with a Nigerian partner), compared to DKK 11.1 million in June 2024. Cost Discipline: Operating expenses were reduced by 19%, administrative and overhead costs by DKK 0.9 million and a reduced headcount, establishing a leaner operating model focused on product development and business development. Strategic Priorities: Management’s near-term focus is built around three priorities: Resolving telco billing challenges and diversifying payment channels: Management is working to resolve ongoing billing challenges with two major telecom partners while expanding into wallets, cards, and diaspora subscriptions. These initiatives aim to stabilise subscription revenue and create more predictable growth. Optimising cost base and building a leaner organisation: The company has reduced OPEX by 19% and streamlined its organisation. These measures create a leaner operating model with greater financial discipline and flexibility. Exploring strategic outcomes from the Deloitte-led ownership review: The Board is reviewing strategic options to maximise shareholder value. The Company expects to give an update on the strategic review before the annual general meeting Guidance for FY 2025/26: Revenue: DKK 12–15 million (2024/25: DKK 11.0 million) EBITDA: DKK -2 to -3 million (2024/25: DKK -5.5 million) Cash Position: DKK 1-2 million (2024/25: DKK 4.7 million) MAUs: 45 million (2024/25: 40.5 million) Management expects improved subscription revenue and tighter cost control to drive progress towards profitability, while continuing to explore strategic options for shareholder value creation.

The Alabama Port Authority has ordered two Konecranes Rubber-Tired Gantry (RTG) cranes for its new intermodal facility in Montgomery, Alabama. The order was booked in Q3 2025 and delivery is scheduled for Q4 2026. Container volumes at Alabama’s Port of Mobile grew from approximately 502,000 TEUs in 2021 to more than 563,000 TEUs in 2023. With more growth expected, the Alabama Port Authority is now developing the Montgomery Intermodal Container Transfer Facility (ICTF). The two new Konecranes RTGs will provide the backbone for container handling at the ICTF, supporting efficient transfers to rail and truck transportation. In addition to Active Load Control, which prevents container sway, the RTGs will have a range of Konecranes Smart Features that make operations safer, faster and automation ready. Auto-steering, Auto-positioning and Auto-TOS Reporting work together to ensure efficient operation and accurate container placement, seamlessly integrated with the terminal operating system (TOS). Stack Collision Prevention and Auto Path Optimizing enhance safety and yard efficiency, while Auto-Truck Guiding directs road trucks accurately for container pick-up and drop-off. This is the Alabama Port Authority’s first investment in Konecranes RTGs, extending a relationship that began in 2001 with the delivery of a Konecranes Gottwald Mobile Harbor Crane. That crane is still in operation, handling containers and breakbulk cargo. “We’ve seen how durable and dependable Konecranes technology is in our daily operations. This track record gave us the confidence to expand the relationship with these RTGs. The new cranes will set the standard for efficiency and handling capacity as we launch the intermodal terminal and scale up operations,” says Doug Otto, Interim Director and CEO of the Alabama Port Authority. “The agreement shows that when performance and reliability are critical – customers turn to Konecranes. We’re proud to support the Alabama Port Authority in this ambitious greenfield project,” says Alan Garcia, Director Regional Sales Americas, Konecranes, Port Solutions. This is part of Konecranes’ path to port automation, where container terminals improve productivity and safety in manageable steps. From smart features up to full automation, the path can include supervised operation and remote operation to smoothly introduce the power of automation.

NEW YORK, Sept. 27, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- What’s Happening: - Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, is investigating potential claims against Methode Electronics Inc. (NYSE:MEI) on behalf of long-term stockholders following a class action complaint that was filed against Methode on August 26, 2024 with a Class Period from June 23, 2022 and March 6, 2024. Our investigation concerns whether the board of directors of Methode have breached their fiduciary duties to the company. Details: - According to the Complaint: (i) Methode Electronics had lost highly skilled and experienced employees during the COVID-19 pandemic necessary to successfully complete Methode Electronics’ transition from its historic low mix, high volume production model to a high mix, low production model at its Monterrey facility; (ii) Methode Electronics’ attempts to replace its General Motors center console production with more diversified, specialized products for a wider array of vehicle manufacturers and OEMs, in particular in the electric vehicle (“EV”) space, had been plagued by production planning deficiencies, inventory shortages, vendor and supplier problems, and, ultimately, botched execution of Methode Electronics’ strategic plans; (iii) Methode Electronics’ manufacturing systems at its critical Monterrey facility suffered from a variety of logistical defects, such as improper system coding, shipping errors, erroneous delivery times, deficient quality control systems, and failures to timely and efficiently procure necessary raw materials; (iv) Methode Electronics had fallen substantially behind on the launch of new EV programs out of its Monterrey facility, preventing Methode Electronics from timely receiving revenue from new EV program awards; and (v) as a result, Methode Electronics was not on track to achieve the 2023 diluted earnings-per-share guidance or the 3-year 6% organic sales compound annual growth rate represented to investors and such estimates lacked a reasonable factual basis. Next Steps: - If you are a long-term stockholder of Methode, have information, would like to learn more about these claims, or have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights or interests with respect to these matters, please contact Brandon Walker or Marion Passmore by email at , by telephone at (212) 355-4648, or by filling out this contact form.

Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 - Transaction volume was 11,606 units for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 40.4% from 8,264 units in the last quarter and an increase of 107.1% from 5,605 units in the same period last year. - Retail transaction volume was 10,385 units for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 37.6% from 7,545 units in the last quarter and an increase of 153.9% from 4,090 units in the same period last year. - Total revenues were RMB658.3 million (US$91.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 30.6% from RMB504.2 million in the last quarter and an increase of 64.1% from RMB401.2 million in the same period last year. - Gross margin was 5.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with 7.0% in the last quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. - Loss from operations was RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB35.3 million in the last quarter and RMB62.5 million in the same period last year. - Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA [1] was a loss of RMB16.5 million (US$2.3 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with a loss of RMB8.9 million in the last quarter and a loss of RMB33.9 million in the same period last year. Mr. Kun Dai, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Uxin, commented, ""Our business sustained its strong growth momentum in the second quarter of 2025, with retail transaction volume reaching 10,385 units, representing a 154% year-over-year increase and marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth above 140%. Importantly, we have also maintained healthy operating efficiency, with inventory turnover days stable at around 30, and customer satisfaction, as measured by NPS (net promoter score), at an industry-leading 65. Reflecting this strength, we now expect retail transaction volume growth of over 125% year-over-year in the third quarter. Accordingly, we are raising our full-year 2025 growth guidance to approximately 130% compared to calendar year 2024."" Mr. Dai continued, ""Since opening in February, our Wuhan superstore has performed ahead of expectations, achieving monthly sales of about 1,400 units with steadily improving profitability. At the same time, the expansion of our new superstores is progressing on schedule, with our Zhengzhou superstore officially commencing operations on September 27. We believe that the continued ramp-up of newly launched superstores, together with the sales momentum at our existing locations, will serve as strong and sustainable growth drivers for our business performance in the years ahead."" Mr. Feng Lin, Chief Financial Officer of Uxin, stated, ""Our strong sales growth this quarter was driven by improved inventory availability at existing stores and the continued ramp-up of our new superstore in Wuhan. Total revenues reached RMB658.3 million, including RMB607.6 million from retail vehicle sales, representing 87% year-over-year growth and 31% sequential growth. Our gross margin was 5.2%, reflecting the temporary impact of the new car price war in China, as well as the early-stage ramp-up of our Wuhan superstore. Looking ahead, we anticipate that unhealthy price competition in China's new car market will be largely resolved thanks to supportive government policies and sales and profitability of our Wuhan superstore will continue to improve. As a result, we anticipate a strong rebound in our overall gross margin in the near future. Specifically, for the third quarter of 2025, we expect retail transaction volume of 13,500 to 14,000 units, representing over 125% year-over-year growth, total revenues of between RMB830 million and RMB860 million, and gross margin recovery to approximately 7.5%."" Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 Total revenues were RMB658.3 million (US$91.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 30.6% from RMB504.2 million in the last quarter and an increase of 64.1% from RMB401.2 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to the increase in retail vehicle sales revenue. Retail vehicle sales revenue was RMB607.6 million (US$84.8 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 30.5% from RMB465.5 million in the last quarter and an increase of 87.0% from RMB325.0 million in the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, retail transaction volume was 10,385 units, representing an increase of 37.6% from 7,545 units last quarter and an increase of 153.9% from 4,090 units in the same period last year. By offering quality products and services, the Company's superstores have earned customer trust and established Uxin as the well-recognized brand in regional markets, leading to a high in-store customer conversion rate. Additionally, since the Company's newly launched superstore in Wuhan commenced trial operations in February 2025, both its inventory levels and sales have increased rapidly. Wholesale vehicle sales revenue was RMB29.9 million (US$4.2 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB22.5 million in the last quarter and RMB63.9 million in the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, wholesale transaction volume was 1,221 units, representing an increase of 69.8% from 719 units last quarter and a decrease of 19.4% from 1,515 units in the same period last year. Wholesale vehicle sales represent vehicles purchased by the Company from individuals that do not meet the Company's retail standards and are subsequently sold through online and offline channels. Other revenue was RMB20.8 million (US$2.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB16.2 million in the last quarter and RMB12.3 million in the same period last year. Cost of revenues was RMB624.1 million (US$87.1 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB468.9 million in the last quarter and RMB375.6 million in the same period last year. Gross margin was 5.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with 7.0% in the last quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross margin was mainly due to aggressive promotions in the new car sector in China during this quarter, which also put pressure on the gross margin for used cars. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was mainly due to the trial operation of our new superstore in Wuhan, which commenced in February 2025. As the store is still in the early stage of operation, it is currently in a gross profit ramp-up phase. The Company expects that its overall gross margin will recover in the third quarter of 2025. Total operating expenses were RMB96.7 million (US$13.5 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Total operating expenses excluding the impact of share-based compensation were RMB86.8 million. - Sales and marketing expenses were RMB74.2 million (US$10.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 20.3% from RMB61.7 million in the last quarter and an increase of 25.0% from RMB59.4 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to the increased salaries for the sales teams. - General and administrative expenses were RMB19.4 million (US$2.7 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 6.0% from RMB18.3 million in the last quarter and a decrease of 30.9% from RMB28.1 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the impact of share-based compensation expenses. - Research and development expenses were RMB3.1 million (US$0.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 6.6% from RMB2.9 million in the last quarter and a decrease of 8.6% from RMB3.4 million in the same period last year. Other operating income, net was RMB19.4 million (US$2.7 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB11.9 million for the last quarter and RMB2.8 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to gains from derecognition of certain long-aged liabilities. Loss from operations was RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB35.3 million in the last quarter and RMB62.5 million in the same period last year. Interest expenses were RMB23.1 million (US$3.2 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 2.5% from RMB22.5 million in the last quarter and an increase of 1.0% from RMB22.9 million in the same period last year. Net loss from operations was net loss of RMB67.6 million (US$9.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with net loss of RMB51.4 million in the last quarter and net loss of RMB49.8 million in the same period last year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was a loss of RMB16.5 million (US$2.3 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with a loss of RMB8.9 million in the last quarter and a loss of RMB33.9 million in the same period last year. Liquidity The Company has incurred net losses since inception. For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Company incurred net loss of RMB67.6 million and operating cash outflow of RMB131.8 million, and the Company's current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately RMB202.2 million and the Company had accumulated deficit in the amount of RMB19.7 billion as of June 30, 2025. Based on the Company's liquidity assessment, which considers the management's plan to address these adverse conditions and events including growing its vehicle sales revenue by increasing the sales volume, improving the gross profit margin by increasing the value-added services offered to its customers, maintaining vehicle turnover rate by managing reasonable vehicle prices, raising funds from planned financings, and adjusting its operation scale if and when necessary, the Company believes that it is probable to effectively implement these plans and accordingly, its current cash and cash equivalents which included funds from equity and debt financings and the cash flows from operations are sufficient for the Company to meet its anticipated working capital requirements and other capital commitments and the Company will be able to meet its payment obligations when liabilities that fall due within the next twelve months from the date of this release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses certain non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss from operations per share – basic and diluted, as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange (losses)/gain, other income/(expenses), structure realignment cost which was mainly severance cost and equity in income of affiliates. The Company defines adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share – basic and diluted as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share excluding impact of share-based compensation, deemed dividend to preferred shareholders due to triggering of a down round feature and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitate investors' assessment of its operating performance as this measure excludes certain finance or non-cash items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations. The Company believe that excluding these items enables us to evaluate our performance period-over-period more effectively and relative to our competitors. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA is that it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation, other income/(expenses) and foreign exchange (losses)/gain have been and may continue to be incurred in the business. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of Uxin's non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.

In that time, the company has appointed its new Global CEO, Konstantin Anissimov, strengthened its leadership team, and achieved greater international expansion. Now that 2025 has entered the fall season, Currency.com is setting its sights on an ambitious new phase of growth. In June, Currency.com hosted a landmark event in Gibraltar — where the company has one of its many licences — presenting its vision for the future of finance to global partners, regulators, and government representatives. The gathering signalled a new chapter for the company, emphasizing its mission to create an accessible digital finance ecosystem. Building on this momentum, Currency.com strengthened its U.S. presence with the appointments of Enrico Serafini as CEO, U.S., and Dave Ackerman as COO, U.S. Their combined expertise in scaling fintech ventures positions the company to rapidly accelerate its expansion across the American market. Regulatory progress has been another key focus. The company recently secured its 31st Money Transmitter License in Tennessee, taking another step toward full coverage across all 50 U.S. states. This milestone reflects Currency.com's dedication to delivering a seamless, customer-centric financial platform that bridges traditional and decentralized finance. Currency.com has also advanced its digital infrastructure with the launch of a new mobile application available in the USA and beyond. This move highlights the company's mobile-first strategy and vision to become a comprehensive financial super app and platform. In parallel, the company is investing in AI-powered infrastructure to enhance security, scalability, and efficiency. Early adoption across R&D and operations has already reduced deployment cycles dramatically, enabling faster delivery of new features. Furthermore, a new partnership with ComplyControl to pilot AI-driven compliance has allowed Currency.com to accelerate and enhance its readiness for regulatory frameworks such as Europe's MiCA. Reflecting on the momentum since its relaunch, Currency.com has already reached significant revenue milestones, with ambitious plans for further growth in the coming 2026. As the fall begins, Currency.com is preparing to roll out updates to its brand identity and the website. This is done as a way of reflecting the company's relaunch and renewed focus on product innovation. While specific product developments still remain under wraps, the company reaffirmed that further innovating and enhancing its financial solutions will remain a central priority. The leadership team will also be present at key upcoming industry events, including TOKEN2049 Singapore, San Francisco Tech Week and Money 20/20 USA in Las Vegas, to engage with partners and share its vision for the future of finance. ""We see our mission as more than building a company — we are helping shape the future of finance itself,"" said Mr. Anissimov. ""With our world-class leadership team now in place, Currency.com is rapidly accelerating its activities, and we have many game-changing developments in the works that we're excited to share with you all soon!""

Pilots are already underway with global enterprise clients in Retail, CPG, Energy and Chemicals. TEL AVIV, Israel, Sept. 29, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Gain, a deeptech startup providing intelligent AI Employees for hire, today emerged from stealth, announcing a $12M seed funding round led by The Garage. Other investors include BlueRed Partners and Bazan Group. Gain has created an autonomous workforce layer that manages end-to-end procurement and operational workflows — from category and merchandising strategy, sourcing and negotiations to contract execution, transaction processing and exception management — all seamlessly integrated with ERP, productivity, collaboration and procurement technologies. Geopolitical tensions and trade wars have pushed supply chains into a state of constant disruption and uncertainty, making procurement increasingly complex. In industries with long-tail spend (e.g., retail, CPG, energy, chemicals), hundreds of small, low-value purchases slip through the cracks, yet together they represent a meaningful share of total expenses, creating hidden costs. Early AI copilots are helping automate these repetitive negotiations and transactions, but they stop short of replacing human judgment or managing unstructured cases where cultural nuance, regulatory compliance, and context really matter. Far exceeding agentic capabilities, Gain's AI Employees handle end-to-end procurement and supply chain processes, acting like dependable teammates who own the more burdensome, time-consuming work. Gain charges only by output, at a fraction of the human cost. ""We've gained unique experience supporting customer- and vendor-facing agentic solutions that drive revenue, and we see Gain as a key standout in this space,"" said Eyal Radler, Managing Partner at The Garage. ""Alongside its groundbreaking R&D work, Gain is disrupting the traditional SaaS pay-per-seat model with its pay-per-outcome approach to encourage early adoption. The team has a unique advantage in its unparalleled access to customers, which today is often the most significant moat. In addition, they are creating proprietary data sets that further strengthen their position and build a durable long-term edge. We're very excited to be working with the team and look forward to ushering in our new AI workforce."" Yishai Klein, Managing Partner at Singapore-based BlueRed Partners adds, ""Gain provides a disruptive and visionary solution for tackling the complex procurement environment and processes across multiple industries and markets. They boast an extremely impressive and proven leadership team. We're thrilled to be supporting the team from the outset, and we look forward to helping them penetrate the Asia-Pacific region."" Developed by world-class AI and cybersecurity experts, Gain's technology combines advanced reasoning, domain-trained models and orchestration layers. This enables its AI Employees to work as a cohesive team in a highly secure and pressure-tested environment. Each Employee is tailored to the customer's environment, then refined through specialized training camps, simulations and live feedback until they consistently outperform humans, maintain compliance and deliver measurable ROI. ""For large and complex energy organizations like ours, the ability to optimize long-tail spend represents a significant opportunity to reduce costs across a wide range of procurement activities,"" said Netta Benari, Head of Business Development & Innovation at Bazan Group. ""Gain has identified a compelling use case for AI in procurement and demonstrated the technical expertise to deliver it. As both a partner in this pilot and a strategic investor, we look forward to deepening our collaboration with Gain on multiple fronts."" Israel's largest brewer, Tempo Beer Industries, is another company piloting the technology. Tempo's CEO Daniel Beer adds, ""Tempo has been at the forefront in automation and robotics for years, driving innovation across industries and operations. Joining forces with Gain to pioneer the adoption of AI Employees in procurement is a natural next step in leading the next wave of change. The concept of an 'AI employee' managing the entire process from start to finish is particularly well-suited to our needs. We are undergoing testing with Natalie and Bob, and it's fascinating to see how AI Employees become part of the team."" Gain's highly experienced founding team is headed by CEO Michael Gabay, founder and former CEO of advanced retail automation platform Trigo. Gabay observes, ""After a decade working with leading grocers and CPGs, I saw the big challenges in sourcing and procurement. Basic automation can't handle the uncertainty and complexity of this field, so we built a team with deep expertise in AI, big data, procurement, and cybersecurity to create AI Employees that outperform even 20-year veterans. Our AI Employees don't replace jobs—they support teams by tackling work that otherwise goes undone and delivering real value. Pilot feedback has been very strong, and we're excited to expand deployments."" Key Features of Gain AI Employees: - Pay per outcome — predictable costs aligned to results - Autonomy with oversight — fully autonomous execution with optional human-in-the-loop; customers retain complete visibility and control - Tailored training — tuned to each industry, geography, supply base and culture - Secure by design — built with end-to-end encryption and enterprise-grade safeguards Gain's AI Employees available for hire: - Natalie — Category Strategy + Negotiation Expert Natalie sets category strategies, identifies opportunities, runs complex negotiations, negotiates multi–supplier strategies, and secures optimal outcomes, guided by simulation, machine learning, and market intelligence. - Bob — Tactical Buyer Bob manages contracts and execution — agreements, approvals, ERP updates — as well as everyday transactions and exceptions. The seed investment will support the next phase of R&D efforts, including the launch of Gain's next upcoming AI Employees, and expansion of the product teams, as well as business growth across the United States and Europe. About Gain Gain is a new workforce layer, embedding AI Employees that do more than assist. They perform at exceptional levels of ability, giving procurement, merchandising and supply chain teams greater capacity, stronger compliance and tighter cost control. All measurable. All visible. Built by battle-tested AI and cybersecurity experts, Gain delivers a workforce with unlimited capacity defined by results, not tasks. Go to GetGain.com for more information.

All of the company’s flights have been canceled. The company will work closely with authorities and employees to implement necessary measures to wind down operations. There are several reasons for this decision, including: the company’s performance has long been weaker than expected, ticket sales have been poor in recent weeks and months following negative media coverage of its operations, and there has been discontent among some employees due to changes in the company’s strategy. Great hopes had been pinned on the revised business model introduced last fall, which at the time was considered a source of considerable optimism. Unfortunately, it has now become clear that these changes cannot deliver results sufficient to overcome the company’s deep-rooted challenges that have built up over time. In hindsight, the new business plan should have been implemented earlier. In light of the above, PLAY is ceasing operations today. Thousands of passengers will need to reorganize their return journeys, around 400 people will lose their jobs, and the company’s partners will suffer losses. On this occasion, the Board and management of PLAY emphasize that every effort was made to reach a different outcome. This decision is the most painful one imaginable in this situation and has only been taken because all other options were deemed exhausted. The Board sincerely apologizes to everyone negatively affected by this outcome.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that C3.ai and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm urges investors in C3.ai who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Feb. 26, 2025 – Aug. 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 21, 2025 Visit: Contact the Firm Now: 844-916-0895 C3.ai, Inc. (AI) Securities Class Action: According to the complaint, filed under the caption Liggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuit alleges that these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive. The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%. The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later than October 21, 2025. “We’re focused on whether C3.ai’s public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health was affecting the company’s ability to close deals and meet financial targets,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Defendants represented that this “refresh cycle” was ""by far the largest we’ve seen probably ever,” would generate “around $400 million to $450 million in product revenue” in 2025 and 2026, and would create strong opportunities to cross-sell additional products and services. Defendants also represented that the refresh cycle would “gain momentum” in the second half of 2025 and beyond. These statements were materially false and misleading. In truth, Defendants knew that the refresh cycle would never be as lucrative as they represented because it consisted of old products that were a “small percentage” of the Company’s business. Moreover, Defendants misrepresented and concealed that they did not have a clear picture of the true number of FortiGate firewalls that could be upgraded. And while telling investors that the refresh would gain momentum over the course of two years, Fortinet misrepresented and concealed that it had aggressively pushed through roughly half of the refresh in a period of just a few months, by the end of 2Q 2025.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Fluor securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Fluor class action, go to or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar. Many of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) costs associated with the Gordie Howe International Bridge (“Gordie Howe”), the Interstate 365 Lyndon B. Johnson (“I-635/LBJ”) and Interstate 35E (“I-35”) highways in Texas projects were growing because of, inter alia, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (2) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on Fluor’s business and financial results; (3) accordingly, Fluor’s financial guidance for the full year 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of Fluor’s risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on Fluor’s business and financial results was understated; and (4) as a result, defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Fluor class action, go to call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

Announces Agreements to Sell Two LR2 Product Tankers and an Update on its Outstanding Debt,"MONACO, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:STNG) (“Scorpio Tankers,” or the “Company”) announced today that it has entered into agreements to sell two vessels and provided an update on its outstanding debt. Vessel Sales The Company has recently entered into agreements to sell two 2019 built scrubber-fitted LR2 product tankers, STI Lobelia and STI Lavender, for $61.2 million per vessel. The sales are expected to close within the fourth quarter of 2025. Emanuele Lauro, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented ""These sales offer the dual benefit of capitalizing on cyclically high secondhand vessel values while further strengthening our balance sheet. At $131 million on a pro-forma basis, the Company’s net debt could reach zero in the near future, an outcome which underscores both the cash-generating power of this market and our commitment to deleveraging.” Update on Current Liquidity and Debt The table below summarizes the Company’s outstanding indebtedness as of the dates presented, and on a pro-forma basis to illustrate the impact of announced vessel sales and debt repayments that are pending closing: During the third quarter of 2025, the Company sold 4,778,000 common shares in DHT Holdings Inc. (“DHT”) at an average price of $12.50 per share. The Company currently owns 4,054,480 common shares in DHT. * Amounts reflect the balances as of September 25, 2025, adjusted for announced debt and lease repayments and net proceeds from vessel sales (after estimated selling costs) which have not yet closed. These include: - The exercise of the purchase options on three vessels that are currently financed through sale and leaseback arrangements. Two of the vessels, STI Guard and STI Gallantry, are scheduled to be purchased in December 2025 and the third vessel, STI Symphony, is scheduled to be purchased in February 2026. The aggregate outstanding lease obligation on these vessels is currently $67.8 million. - The agreements to sell the 2020 built scrubber-fitted MR product tanker, STI Maestro for $42.0 million, along with the 2019 built scrubber-fitted LR2 product tankers, STI Lobelia and STI Lavender, for $61.2 million per vessel. These sales are expected to close within the fourth quarter of 2025. The outstanding debt on STI Maestro of $5.1 million was repaid on the 2023 $1.0 Billion Credit Facility in September 2025, with a corresponding $10.2 million reduction in the undrawn revolving portion of the facility. An aggregate of $14.0 million is expected to be paid on the 2023 $1.0 Billion Credit Facility with respect to STI Lobelia and STI Lavender, with a corresponding $30.7 million reduction in the undrawn revolving portion of the facility. About Scorpio Tankers Inc. Scorpio Tankers Inc. is a provider of marine transportation of petroleum products worldwide. Scorpio Tankers Inc. currently owns or lease finances 99 product tankers (38 LR2 tankers, 47 MR tankers and 14 Handymax tankers) with an average age of 9.5 years.

The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides safe harbor protections for forward‐looking statements in order to encourage companies to provide prospective information about their business. Forward‐looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical facts.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR TRONOX INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2025, Tronox released its second quarter 2025 financial results, revealing a significant reduction in sales for its TiO2 product, citing “softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics.” Additionally, the Company revised its 2025 financial outlook, lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%. On this news, Tronox’s stock price fell $1.95, or 37.9%, to close at $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company was ill-equipped to adequately forecast demand for its pigment and zircon products or otherwise minimize the impact of potential demand fluctuations; (2) the Company continued to promote its lofty margin projections which relied upon continually increased sales volumes in its pigment and zircon division; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Tronox common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than November 3, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

(Nasdaq: OTLK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on optimizing the standard of care for bevacizumab for the treatment of retina diseases, today announced that it has completed the Type A Meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the complete response letter (CRL) dated August 27, 2025 regarding the biologics license application (BLA) resubmission for ONS-5010, an investigational ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab under development to treat wet AMD. Based on the discussion with the FDA, Outlook Therapeutics expects to resubmit its BLA before the end of calendar year 2025, after reviewing the agency’s feedback and meeting minutes. “We had a productive discussion with the FDA. Based on our meeting, and pending receipt of the agency’s written minutes, we plan to resubmit the BLA later this year. We remain committed to providing patients, physicians and payors in the U.S. with a safe and effective ophthalmic bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD,” commented Bob Jahr, Chief Executive Officer of Outlook Therapeutics. About ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma) ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ is an ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for the treatment of wet AMD. LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma) is the subject of a centralized Marketing Authorization granted by the European Commission in the EU and Marketing Authorization granted by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK for the treatment of wet AMD. In the United States, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg) is investigational. In certain European Union Member States ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ must receive pricing and reimbursement approval before it can be sold. Bevacizumab-vikg (bevacizumab gamma in the EU and UK) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively binds with high affinity to all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and neutralizes VEGF’s biologic activity through a steric blocking of the binding of VEGF to its receptors Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2) on the surface of endothelial cells. Following intravitreal injection, the binding of bevacizumab to VEGF prevents the interaction of VEGF with its receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation in the retina. About Outlook Therapeutics, Inc. Outlook Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg, bevacizumab gamma) to optimize the standard of care for bevacizumab for the treatment of retina diseases. LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma) is the first ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab to receive European Commission and MHRA Marketing Authorization for the treatment of wet AMD. Outlook Therapeutics commenced commercial launch of LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab gamma) in Germany and the UK as a treatment for wet AMD. In the United States, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™ (bevacizumab-vikg) is investigational. If approved in the United States, ONS-5010/LYTENAVA™, would be the first approved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab for use in retinal indications, including wet AMD.

NEW YORK, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- What’s Happening: - Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm, announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo” or the “Company”) (NYSE:NVO) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Novo securities between May 7, 2025, to July 28, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”). - Investors have until September 30, 2025 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. Allegation Details: - According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Novo’s growth potential; notably, that its asserted potential to capitalize on the compounded market greatly understated the potential impact of the personalization exception to the compounded GLP-1 exclusion and overstated the likelihood such patients would switch to Novo’s branded alternatives, and further greatly overstated the potential GLP-1 market or otherwise Novo’s capability to penetrate said markets to achieve continued growth. - On July 29, 2025, Novo announced it was lowering its sales and profit outlook ahead of reporting its results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed the guide down on “lowered growth expectations for the second half of 2025” for both Wegovy and Ozempic due to “the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition.” - Following this news, the price of Novo’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $69.00 per share on July 28, 2025, Novo’s stock price fell to $53.94 per share on July 29, 2025, a decline of about 21.83% in the span of just a single day.

LOS ANGELES, Sept. 28, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the Weekly Report Issue 022, FX 4 Special Edition, and also the 5th Monthly Report. Earlier this year, we promised to announce the product plan for FX’s second possible model, the FX 4, in Q3. Today, we are delivering on that promise. Before that, let me first share a key update from the EAI Flywheel this week. We have confirmed the FX Super One Middle East Final Launch event will be held on October 28. And we plan to start the first deliveries in the Middle East in November. This is a major milestone for both FF and FX, signaling a pivotal shift for our Middle East “Third Pole” as we transition from an operational phase to revenue generation. Right now, our teams are in full preparation for the launch. Engineering and production are working overtime, software upgrades are ongoing, and critical third-party ecosystem validations are in progress. Recently, in Ras Al Khaimah, UAE, we also completed testing of the Super One’s HVAC system, laying a solid foundation for the upcoming upgrade to a stronger AC system. In addition, by invitation of the organizers, FF and FX will join WETEX 2025 in Dubai from September 30 to October 2. WETEX is one of the largest and most influential exhibitions for sustainable and clean energy in the Middle East. We will bring both the FF 91 and the FX Super One to the event, and invite UAE royal family members, government officials, and industry elites from around the globe to experience our products. Now let’s move to the most important part today — the FX 4 product execution plan. The FX 4 is the first potential model under the FX brand designed for the volume market, especially the huge blue-ocean segment under $40,000. It would be positioned as a compact 5-seat SUV, and just like Super One, it will offer both battery electric and AIHER versions. The FX 4 could become a representative of extreme price-experience ratio, aiming to disrupt the traditional SUV market and reshape the purchase choices of mainstream users in the U.S. FX 4 is not only for young people and families’ daily commuting. It also covers a wider range of multi-functional use cases — from light off-road to camping — becoming a versatile partner for users’ diverse lifestyles. On the sales side, we believe our Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales could unleash even greater momentum for the FX 4, making the Blue Ocean + Blockbuster Product strategy a reality. I believe the launch of FX 4 can bring three core values: 1. User Value: There is a vast, untapped opportunity in the US auto market. While New Energy Vehicle penetration has reached nearly 50% in China, it stands at just 8% in the United States. Especially in the $20,000 to $40,000 range, there are almost no competitive AIEV products. The FX 4 would be engineered to fill this structural void. By meeting the essential needs of the broadest possible consumer base, it could dramatically speed up our mission to deliver “An AIEV for Everyone.” 2. Industry Value: The FX 4 is poised to accelerate the transformation of the U.S. AIEV industry with its extreme price-experience ratio. This is made possible by FF and FX’s unique Global Automotive Industry Bridge Strategy, which leverages the cost and efficiency advantages of China’s supply chain and the power of FF’s Five Areas of Empowerment. 3. Corporate value: Following the success of the FX Super One in opening the blue-ocean market for MPVs, the FX 4 is now poised to capture a second critical blue-ocean market: the U.S. segment under $40,000. It is designed to be our keystone mass-market product and the true Disruptor to RAV4 in the AIEV era. This could create a powerful “Spire + Base” synergy between FF and FX, fully implementing our unique Light 4, Swift 4, Focused 5, and Empowering 5 model Next, let me share the upcoming release activities for FX 4: On October 28, at the Middle East Final Launch event for Super One, we will also announce progress for the potential FX 4 in North America, along with the first design rendering. This November, at the LA Auto Show, we plan to host the first unveiling of the FX 4's product strategy. At the same event, we also plan to launch the first-ever test drive and ride experiences for the entire FF and FX vehicle lineup. In January 2026 at CES in Las Vegas, we plan to launch the co-creation and sales campaign for our two planned Blue Ocean products — FX Super One and FX 4 — and release more details about our unique Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales model. Beyond FX, FF is making good progress as well: This past Friday, FF delivered an FF 91 2.0 to Calvin Gong, President of Pinnacle, one of the largest Chinese real estate companies in Southern California. Calvin and Pinnacle will also join us as co-creation officers and partners. On October 8, we will hold the “Drive Home Together” co-creation ceremony, continuing to deepen our “Luxury Car + Luxury Home” collaboration model. And finally, Crypto Flywheel: Since FF announced the $30M investment and my personal $4M strategic investment in QLGN at 919, the market response has been very positive. Based on QLGN’s closing price on Friday, our upcoming $30M investment would equate to a more than 100% unrealized gain. We expect to complete the closing of this strategic investment next week. Going forward, FFAI will stay fully focused on the EAI business, putting all efforts into accelerating product roll-off and delivery milestones. Thank you. And see you next week.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Captioned Maglione v. Fluor Corporation, No. 25-cv-02496 (N.D. Tex.), the Fluor class action lawsuit charges Fluor and certain of Fluor’s top current and former executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Fluor class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at . CASE ALLEGATIONS: Fluor provides engineering, procurement, and construction; fabrication and modularization; and project management services. Fluor’s infrastructure projects include work on the Gordie Howe International Bridge (“Gordie Howe”), as well as the Interstate 365 Lyndon B. Johnson (“I-635/LBJ”) and Interstate 35E (“I-35”) highways in Texas, according to the complaint. The Fluor class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) costs associated with the Gordie Howe, I-635/LBJ, and I-35 projects were growing because of, among other things, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (ii) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on Fluor’s business and financial results; and (iii) accordingly, Fluor’s financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of Fluor’s risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on Fluor’s business and financial results was understated. The Fluor class action lawsuit further alleges that, on August 1, 2025, Fluor reported second quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.43, missing consensus estimates by $0.13, and revenue of $3.98 billion, representing a 5.9% year-over-year decline and missing consensus estimates by $570 million. Defendants blamed these disappointing results on, among other things, growing costs in multiple infrastructure projects due to subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays, as well as reduced capital spending by customers, the complaint alleges. Fluor also provided a negatively revised financial outlook for fiscal year 2025, citing “client hesitation around economic uncertainty and its impact on new awards and project delays and results for the quarter.” The complaint also alleges that Fluor’s CEO, defendant James R. Breuer, further disclosed during an earnings call that the infrastructure projects that had negatively impacted Fluor’s second quarter 2025 results were the Gordie Howe, I-635/LBJ, and I-35 projects. Following this news, the price of Fluor stock fell by more than 27%, according to the Fluor class action lawsuit. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Fluor securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Fluor class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Fluor class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Fluor class action lawsuit.

(FTNT) Shareholders Who Lost Money Urged To Contact Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP About Securities Fraud Lawsuit","LOS ANGELES, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP reminds investors of the upcoming November 21, 2025 deadline to file a lead plaintiff motion in the class action filed on behalf of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Fortinet, Inc. (“Fortinet” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: FTNT) common stock between November 8, 2024 through August 6, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR FORTINET INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On August 6, 2025, Fortinet released its second quarter 2025 financial results, revealing that the Company was “approximately 40% to 50% of the way through the 2026 [firewall] upgrade cycle at the end of the second quarter based on the remaining active units and service contracts[.]” Additionally, the Company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance for the upcoming third quarter, projecting revenue between $1.67 billion and $1.73 billion. On this news, Fortinet’s stock price fell $21.28, or 22%, to close at $75.30 per share on August 7, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the refresh cycle would never be as lucrative as they represented, nor could it, because it consisted of old products that were a “small percentage” of the Company’s business; (2) Defendants did not have a clear picture of the true number of FortiGate firewalls that could be upgraded; (3) while telling investors that the refresh would gain momentum over the course of two years, Fortinet misrepresented and concealed that it had aggressively pushed through roughly half of the refresh in a period of months, by the end of 2Q 2025; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Fortinet common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than November 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

The North American tire market is strong for premium tires, radials, sustainable solutions, and smart tire technologies. The U.S. is a big market because it has high vehicle ownership and logistics expansion. Canada is associated with winter and all-season tires, while Mexico supports the region through a growing manufacturing base and increasing domestic automotive sales. Stringent fuel efficiency standards and safety regulations have driven advancements in tire technology. E-commerce and logistics ride high further on the demand for replacement tires, keeping the aftermarket segment rather crucial all over the region. Key Trends & Drivers - The Rising Vehicle Ownership: Considering a growing middle class in Asia-Pacific and Latin America, vehicle ownership is on a rapid rise in the categories of passenger cars and two-wheelers. Mostly, demand is driven by increasing affordability, urbanization, and infrastructure development activities. Thus, OEM tire sales increase accordingly, and the aftermarket, in turn, throws recurring opportunities for tire replacement. - Aftermarket Development: Other aftermarket demands push the intentions for growth and are further supported by road conditions, accidents, and causes for shorter replacement cycles. The faster growth of e-commerce websites and multi-brand tire outlets has increased accessibility and choice for consumers. Additionally, increased awareness of tire safety and performance provides additional thrust to premium replacement product demand. - Technological Evolution: Continuous technical advances in radial, tubeless, and smart tires are reshaping the market. Milestones on this path foster better fuel efficiency, safety checks, and longer life for the respective tires. Eco-measures, including low-rolling-resistance and recyclable tires, are being encouraged with the onset of stringent regulations. Any adoption of technological measures for tire manufacturing would thus guarantee market growth in the long term and aid sustainability objectives. Request a Customized Copy of the Rubber Tire Market Report @ - Raw Material Volatility: Natural rubber and synthetic rubber constitute pricing elements for tire manufacture. Price fluctuations caused by climate change, geopolitical dislocations, or crude oil price swings do have a direct impact on production costs. Manufacturers are having trouble maintaining stable pricing and keeping their margins intact, and so raw material volatility remains the perennial market dynamic. - Regulatory Influence: Global fuel efficiency, emission, and road safety laws directly dictate product development strategies. For instance, Europe has regulations emphasizing low-rolling-resistance tires, while North America focuses on eco-friendly compounds. Regimes such as these promote innovations in sustainable tires, recycling, and retreading, the very next step in industry focus after creating opportunities that must be seized by foresighted manufacturers. - Competitive Landscape: Corrosion of the rubber tire market has become an ever-growing crocodile, where Bridgestone, Michelin, and Goodyear dominate the premium segment on a global scale, while regional players compete on affordability. Companies undergo mergers, expansion of capacities, and diversification of product ranges to strengthen their positioning. The highly competitive nature and market climate dictate continuous innovation to provide consumers with cost-effective, high-performance, sustainable tire solutions.

Request a Customized Copy of the Rubber Tire Market Report @ SWOT Analysis - Strengths: The tire market benefits enormously from the large, recurring demand base created by vehicle production worldwide and its supply cycle. The leading manufacturers possess strong R&D provide for innovation in areas such as radial, tubeless, and smart tires. OEM associations help secure the steady flow of revenues. Accordingly, established profiles have diversified their product portfolios to cater to passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, OTR vehicles, and special-purpose vehicles. Globalised networks, coupled with a strong aftermarket presence, enhance accessibility. Innovations in eco-friendly and fuel-efficient tires allow the industry to align with regulatory obligations and sustainability trends, ensuring its long-term resilience in both developed and emerging markets. - Weaknesses: Latex and other synthetic rubbers present the major raw material concerns of the industry. Their supply is prone to fluctuations in price, creating uncertain working conditions. Capital-intensive production and ongoing investment in R&D tend to squeeze realizable profits, mostly from smaller producers. The manufacturing of tires, with its energy-intensive processes that lead to carbonization, is the target of criticism. Finally, bias-ply in developing countries is limiting the growth of the premium segment. Intense competition from regional and global players is putting pressure on prices, while dependence on OEM contracts makes companies vulnerable to cyclical fluctuations in automotive production volumes, thereby affecting their financial stability. - Opportunities: There is a serious opportunity for the development of sustainable and eco-friendly tires utilizing bio-based materials, recyclable compounds, and retreading solutions. Integration of various smart tire technologies interfacing with sensors for on-the-fly monitoring creates value propositions for both passenger and commercial vehicles. Emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa impart strong growth potential through increased vehicle ownership and infrastructure buildup. As electrification gains prominence, there is a growing need for specialized tires that offer higher load capacity and enhanced efficiency. Online retail is gaining more and more traction, thus making them more accessible in the aftermarket scenario, and government schemes for promoting green mobility provide an impetus for faster adoption of such tire-based solutions. Together, they create openings to growth and differentiation. - Threats: Being volatile in nature, raw material prices, especially those of steel and aluminum, weigh heavily. Rising tariffs, trade barriers, and geopolitics prove harmful to the market and also complicate international supply chains. Climatic conditions or regional instabilities cause volatility in the supply of natural rubber, which adds to the risk. This brings up the long-term consideration that demand for passenger car tires may decrease due to shared mobility, autonomous fleets, and reduced ownership of private vehicles. In price-sensitive markets, established players face significant competition primarily from Asian low-cost producers. Compliance would be costly for these smaller producers in terms of sustainability and emission standards. Likewise, another issue that squeezes margins is the rising cost of raw materials and energy, whereas an economic recession would halt the demand for both OEM tires and aftermarket tires.

Local car production sustains a relatively strong OEM demand, but the constant replacement of tires drives most of the revenue from aftermarket sales. Exports to neighboring countries also serve to boost Brazil’s capacity as a regional tire hub. - Brazil Rubber Tire Market: The Saudi Arabia rubber tire market with high vehicle ownership, expanding logistics, and infrastructure projects. Severe climatic conditions routinely require aftermarket tires, which dominate demand. Premium radial tires grew in demand, and government initiatives for economic diversification cast a positive outlook on both passenger and commercial vehicle tire segments over the long term.

(NASDAQ: LFMD) and its executives. The suit alleges the telehealth company presented a misleadingly optimistic picture of its financial health and growth, ultimately resulting in a dramatic stock price decline in August. The action was filed in the Eastern District of New York. The lawsuit, Johnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7, 2025, and August 5, 2025, and is seeking to recover damages for investors who suffered substantial losses Video: The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. - Class Period: May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 27, 2025 - Contact the Firm Now: - Phone: 844-916-0895 - Email: - Website Form: Allegations: Optimistic Guidance Unraveled by Internal Issues: The complaint highlights a pivotal moment on May 6, 2025, when LifeMD reported strong first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The company touted a “category-defining competitive moat” in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand. However, the lawsuit contends that this optimistic outlook was misleading because the company allegedly failed to disclose critical, ongoing business challenges, including: - Rising Customer Acquisition Costs (RexMD): The company was reportedly experiencing a surge in costs to acquire new customers in its RexMD segment. - Higher-Than-Anticipated Refund Rate: There was a higher-than-expected rate of patient refunds in its weight management business. The alleged deception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance. During the earnings call, management cited the very issues the lawsuit alleges were previously concealed: “temporary elevated customer acquisition costs” for RexMD and problems with patient refunds for its weight management offerings. The following day, LifeMD’s stock price plummeted by over 44%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Hagens Berman, a national plaintiffs’ rights firm, is actively investigating these claims on behalf of damaged investors. “The core issue here is whether LifeMD's management provided an accurate foundation for its bullish financial guidance,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. “We are investigating if the company knew about the severe impact of rising customer acquisition costs and refund issues on its key revenue streams, yet chose to conceal these facts to artificially inflate its stock price.” If you invested in LifeMD and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now » If you’d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the LifeMD case and our investigation, read more » Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding LifeMD should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

Investors with Substantial Losses Have Opportunity to Lead Securities Class Action Lawsuit","SAN DIEGO, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNTH) securities between February 26, 2025 and August 5, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until Monday, November 10, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Lantheus class action lawsuit. Captioned Margolis v. Lantheus Holdings, Inc., No. 25-cv-07491 (S.D.N.Y.), the Lantheus class action lawsuit charges Lantheus and certain of Lantheus’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Lantheus class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at . CASE ALLEGATIONS: Lantheus develops, manufactures, and commercializes diagnostic and therapeutic products that assist clinicians in diagnosis and treatment of heart, cancer, and other diseases worldwide. According to the complaint, Lantheus’s key Radiopharmaceutical Oncology product is Pylarify, a PET imaging agent used to assist in both diagnosing and subsequently treating prostate cancer. The Lantheus class action lawsuit alleges that defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Lantheus’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth while also minimizing risk from competition and pricing dynamics, seasonality, and macroeconomic fluctuations. In truth, according to the complaint, Lantheus’s optimistic reports of Pylarify’s sales growth potential and pricing normalization fell short of reality and Lantheus, despite defendants’ claims, did not have an accurate understanding of the pricing and competitive dynamics of Pylarify’s market. The Lantheus class action lawsuit further alleges that on May 7, 2025, Lantheus reported its first quarter 2025 results, disclosing that Pylarify sales had decreased year-over-year due to an alleged “temporal competitive disruption.” The complaint alleges that defendants further reduced their previous full-year projections due to Pylarify’s shortfall, reducing the “year-over-year range to flat-to-low single-digit percent growth for the full year versus our prior view of low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth.” On this news, the price of Lantheus stock fell more than 23%, according to the complaint. Then, on August 6, 2025, the Lantheus class action lawsuit further alleges that Lantheus again announced disappointing results and significantly reduced growth expectations for Pylarify, which had fallen 8.3% year-over-year, and slashed fiscal year 2025 growth projections further. On this news, the price of Lantheus stock fell nearly 29%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Lantheus securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Lantheus class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Lantheus class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Lantheus class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Lantheus class action lawsuit.

(NYSE: SNAP) securities between April 29, 2025 and August 5, 2025, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until Monday, October 20, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Snap class action lawsuit. Captioned Abdul-Hameed v. Snap Inc., No. 25-cv-07844 (C.D.

Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at . CASE ALLEGATIONS: Snap operates as a technology company. The Snap class action lawsuit alleges that defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Snap’s expected advertising revenue and anticipated growth while emphasizing potential macroeconomic instability. In truth, according to the complaint, Snap’s optimistic reports of advertising growth and earnings potential fell short of reality as they relied far too heavily on Snap’s ability to execute on its potential and Snap was already experiencing the ramifications of a significant execution error when defendants claimed a lack of visibility due to macroeconomic conditions. The Snap class action lawsuit further alleges that on August 5, 2025, defendants released disappointing second quarter fiscal year 2025 results, disclosing that advertising revenue decelerated significantly in the quarter, in part, due to Snap having “shipped a change that caused some campaigns to clear the auction at substantially reduced prices.” On this news, the price of Snap stock fell more than 17%, according to the complaint.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR FLUOR INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On August 1, 2025, Fluor released its second quarter 2025 financial results, missing consensus estimates, citing growing costs in multiple infrastructure projects due to subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays, as well as reduced capital spending by customers. The Company also lowered its full year 2025 outlook due to “client hesitation around economic uncertainty and its impact on new awards and project delays and results for the quarter[.]” On this news, Fluor’s stock price fell $15.35, or 27%, to close at $41.42 per share on August 1, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) costs associated with the Gordie Howe, I-635/LBJ, and I-35 projects were growing because of, inter alia, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (2) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on the Company’s business and financial results; (3) accordingly, Fluor’s financial guidance for FY 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of the Company’s risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on the Company’s business and financial results was understated; and (4) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Fluor securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than November 14, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

So what: If you purchased Fluor securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. What to do next: To join the Fluor class action, go to or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than November 14, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) costs associated with the Gordie Howe International Bridge (""Gordie Howe""), the Interstate 365 Lyndon B. Johnson (""I-635/LBJ"") and Interstate 35E (""I-35"") highways in Texas projects were growing because of, inter alia, subcontractor design errors, price increases, and scheduling delays; (2) the foregoing, as well as customer reduction in capital spending and client hesitation around economic uncertainty, was having, or was likely to have, a significant negative impact on Fluor's business and financial results; (3) accordingly, Fluor's financial guidance for the full year 2025 was unreliable and/or unrealistic, the effectiveness of Fluor's risk mitigation strategy was overstated, and the impact of economic uncertainty on Fluor's business and financial results was understated; and (4) as a result, defendants' public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Fluor class action, go to call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email [email protected] for information on the class action. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point.

A recent report by ABI Research, a global technology intelligence firm, stated that AI-RAN revenues are projected to reach approximately US$6.18 billion by 2032, with significant acceleration anticipated from 2029 onward. Despite this promising forecast, current operator adoption remains cautious due to a lack of independently verified return on investment and field-proven performance results. Even though vendor interest is gaining momentum, as evidenced by a membership growth rate of the AI-RAN Alliance from 11 initial members a year ago to over 80 today, operator interest is less abundant at only 8 members. The gap between vendor and operator participation signals some industry skepticism regarding the near-term value of AI-RAN. Existing pilots like SoftBank's AITRAS platform and NVIDIA's pilots in Shenzhen are promising, but those initiatives still lack third-party validation of systemwide cost savings and performance improvement. ""The real growth in AI-RAN will only come when performance benchmarks are validated in the field,"" explains Samuel Bowling, Research Analyst at ABI Research. ""Operators need evidence that AI-RAN can deliver technical and financial outcomes at scale, with a justifiable cost model. Without that, adoption will continue to lag behind vendor enthusiasm."" One of the central factors influencing adoption is the ongoing debate around compute architecture. GPU-based platforms such as NVIDIA's Aerial RAN Computer-1 and ARC-Compact provide high-performance for use cases like massive MIMO and beamforming, though some worry remains about their high energy consumption, reliance on proprietary software stacks, and potential vendor lock-in. Meanwhile, CPU-based solutions and custom silicon implementations continue to meet current AI requirements while being more energy efficient and lower cost, which supports operators' needs for flexibility and operational efficiency. This uncertainty over architectural direction continues to slow AI-RAN decision-making across markets. ""Operators need more than hype, they need transparent, validated evidence that AI-RAN delivers real-world performance and long-term value,"" says Bowling. ""The AI-RAN Alliance must now move beyond vision statements and facilitate real pilot deployments with Tier One operators, standardize benchmarks, and publish clear comparisons across GPU, CPU, and custom silicon solutions. Demonstrating cost savings and performance in urban, rural, and remote environments will be critical to building trust and moving from trials to widespread commercial deployments by 2030.""

The investigation centers on whether the Company made false and/or misleading statements or omitted information critical to investors. On August 1, 2025, Fluor announced its second-quarter financial results and reduced its full-year forecast. The Company attributed its underwhelming performance to rising expenses across several infrastructure projects—citing subcontractor design flaws, cost escalations, and timeline setbacks. It further stated that clients are cutting back on capital expenditures. These challenges were not previously disclosed when the Company reaffirmed its full-year outlook.

ZUG, Switzerland, Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Altoo AG today announced results from its 2025 client survey, confirming the Altoo Wealth Platform has become indispensable to ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices. Clients cite a consolidated wealth view, intuitive navigation, and strong transparency as key reasons they rely on Altoo daily. As in 2024, clients again highlight the total consolidated wealth view, ease of use, and technical security as defining strengths. What clients value Clients point to three factors. First, a complete overview of bankable and non-bankable assets, transactions and prices across institutions. Second, an intuitively structured interface that makes it simple to move from a top-level view to detail. Third, transparency that strengthens reporting and investment decisions. Feedback from last year describing Altoo as a ""game changer"" and a ""world-class asset management platform"" continues to be reflected in the sentiment this year.

Without extensive voluntary commitments by corporate buyers to purchase clean energy, fewer projects will be financed and built, and the U.S. will struggle to meet growing energy demand. A new study commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers Association (CEBA) provides some of the strongest data to date that long-term corporate virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) are crucial in getting new renewable energy projects off the ground. Misti Groves, senior vice president of U.S. Strategy at CEBA, noted, ""It confirms that corporate buyers are critical to ensuring the U.S. can build enough clean energy at the pace and scale that's needed to meet skyrocketing power demand from the growth in artificial intelligence, electrification, and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing."" David Groleau, executive vice president of Pine Gate Renewables, which develops, owns, and operates utility scale solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., said, ""Corporate buyers are the backbone of clean energy deployment, anchoring project financing and shaping the future of reliable, cost-effective power."" The study, which was completed by renewable energy data company REsurety, analyzed the economic performance of 251 wind and solar projects across three major power markets — Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and PJM Interconnection — and found that revenues for such projects often face significant financial headwinds without corporate buyer support. Corporate clean energy buyers often enter into long-term contracts with clean energy projects to purchase the future electricity produced for a fixed price, through a contract called a VPPA. It's only possible to finance a project if the loan provider knows who will buy the electricity and at what price, so without these contracts, projects won't get the necessary loans to finance development. REsurety found that VPPAs reduce the number of projects facing financial distress — defined as a negative cash flow — by 90% in MISO and PJM, and 80% in ERCOT. ""In this next year, as renewable energy projects aim to meet deadlines for tax credits, the support and cooperation of corporate buyers will give developers the confidence to advance spending to secure tax credits to reduce the cost of renewable energy,"" said Joan Hutchinson, managing director of Offtake Advisory, Marathon Capital. Renewable energy certificates (RECs) also have an impact, reducing projects in financial distress by 30% and providing additional stable revenue. Over the past decade, corporate buyers have become a steadying force in the U.S. clean energy market, accounting for more than 40% of new U.S. clean energy capacity additions. Maintaining that momentum is essential to ensuring that U.S. clean energy electricity grows at the pace and scale needed to meet the momentous challenge of increasing demand. ""The acceleration of corporate purchases from clean energy projects transformed the U.S. market over the past 10 years, providing developers and owners long-term, stable revenues on projects and a view on future demand to help maintain continued growth,"" said Emily Cohen, chief commercial officer of Primergy. ""As new markets evolve, we are excited to see more corporates buying energy across the country to bring the benefits of new energy resources."" The Clean Energy Buyers Association is a business trade association that activates a community of energy customers and partners to deploy market and policy solutions for a carbon emissions-free energy system. CEBA's more than 400 members comprise one-fifth of the Fortune 500, represent more than $33 trillion in market capitalization, and include institutional energy customers of every type and size — corporate and industrial companies, universities, and cities.

Chin's Historic Keynote in South Korea Spotlights the Next Wave of Spine Innovations,"At the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Korean Spinal Neurosurgery Society in Seoul, KIC Ventures' Founder and CEO Unveils a Global Vision for Transforming Spine Surgery. FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As the spine industry today continues to double down on rigid fixation and hospital-driven procedures, orthopedic spine surgeon, professor, and KIC Ventures CEO & Founder Dr. Kingsley R. Chin stands out for having charted a different course years earlier. In his 2018 keynote at the 32nd Annual Meeting of the Korean Spinal Neurosurgery Society (KSNS) , Dr. Chin issued a bold and prescient call for change. Speaking on an international stage in Busan, South Korea, he predicted a future in which motion-preserving technologies and Less Exposure Spine Surgery (LESS™) techniques would move spine care out of hospitals and into outpatient settings. Calling Out the Fusion Paradigm In 2018, Dr. Chin highlighted how decades of industry-driven reliance on pedicle screws and interbody cages had resulted in costly, high-risk hospital procedures without meaningfully improving long-term outcomes. He argued that rigid fixation was an outdated model, dominated by hospitals and resistant to innovation. Instead, he championed a new era in which technologies are designed to preserve motion, respect anatomy, and move care from hospitals to ambulatory surgery centers — the foundation of KIC Ventures' REP principles: Restore function, Early treatment, Preserve anatomy. ""The fusion model—pedicle screws, cages, and rigid fixation—is failing patients and stifling innovation,"" Dr. Chin said in his address. ""The future belongs to motion-preserving devices delivered with Less Exposure Spine Surgery techniques in outpatient settings."" Evidence of a Market Shift Since Dr. Chin's 2018 keynote, his warnings have become reality. Several major players have exited or restructured their spine divisions, including Zimmer Biomet , NuVasive , and Stryker . Market caps for leading companies such as Orthofix and Globus Medical have also declined as traditional fusion-based models face increasing scrutiny. These market shifts underscore the validity of Dr. Chin's prediction that rigid fixation and hospital-centric approaches would struggle to sustain growth. Why MedTech Investors Should Listen While many medtech investors focus narrowly on short-term revenue targets and quarterly metrics, KIC Ventures has consistently looked ahead to where the market is heading. Dr. Chin's 2018 keynote was not only a prediction — it was a roadmap. Five years later, that roadmap is unfolding exactly as forecast. By trusting KIC Ventures' proven ability to anticipate and shape industry shifts — from motion preservation to Less Exposure Spine Surgery — investors can participate in the creation of entirely new categories rather than simply watching old ones shrink. The Vision: Motion Preservation, REP Principles, and LESS™ Philosophy At the center of Dr. Chin's keynote was AxioMed's viscoelastic total disc replacement—a motion-preserving device built on the REP principles and the LESS™ philosophy. Together with NANISX™, KIC Ventures' platform delivering differentiated technologies such as InSpan™, Sacrix™, and FacetFuse™ for LESS™ exposure stabilization and decompression in ASCs, these technologies embody the company's strategy of creating a full spectrum of motion-preserving and less-exposure spine solutions backed by global clinical evidence. NanoFUSE® complements this portfolio as the company's synthetic biologics and regenerative spine platform. Acting on the Prediction KIC Ventures has acted decisively on Dr. Chin's vision by advancing AxioMed's motion-preserving technology, expanding NANISx™ solutions for outpatient stabilization and decompression, and championing the Less Exposure Spine Surgery movement. Beyond disc replacement, KIC Ventures is opening new markets in interventional pain management and investing in the creation of a new interventional spine surgery specialty — redefining how spine care is delivered globally and offering investors a rare opportunity to participate in building these new categories from the ground up. Global Momentum In 2024, KIC Ventures attended EuroSpine in Austria, where the company showcased AxioMed technologies and deepened relationships with European partners. This year, KIC Ventures will participate in EuroSpine Copenhagen, reinforcing its global footprint and its leadership in motion-preserving spine solutions. Surgeon validation continues to grow internationally: AxioMed's cervical and lumbar discs have been validated by leading surgeons in Australia. Global Engagement at KSNS Dr. Chin's address at KSNS sparked significant interest among Korean neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons eager to explore how motion-preserving technologies could elevate patient outcomes. The keynote also underscored the importance of international collaboration to accelerate the transition from hospital-centric fusion to outpatient motion preservation. ""What we discussed in Busan was a turning point — we were showing the world that spine surgery does not have to be hospital-based and reliant on outdated fixation technologies,"" Dr. Chin reflected. ""We could already see the future unfolding."" A Personal and Professional Milestone For Dr. Chin, who was born and raised in Buff Bay, Jamaica, the keynote represented the culmination of years of dedication to advancing Less Exposure Spine Surgery and motion-preserving spine care: ""To stand in Busan as a professor, surgeon, and CEO — presenting a vision for outpatient disc replacement as the successor to traditional fusion — was deeply humbling,"" he said. ""It confirmed our belief that spine surgery must evolve."" Looking Ahead: A Vision That Endures Years later, Dr. Chin's predictions at KSNS remain strikingly prescient as the spine field continues its pivot toward outpatient care and motion-preserving technologies using Less Exposure Spine Surgery techniques. His 2018 keynote stands as an early marker of this global shift, showing that the move away from traditional fusion toward disc replacement in outpatient settings was not just possible but inevitable. About KIC Ventures Founded in 2013 as the venture arm of Kingsley Investment Company (KIC) LLC, KIC Ventures focuses exclusively on advancing outpatient spine surgery through its Less Exposure Spine Surgery (LESS™) philosophy. With a portfolio of innovative spine technologies and a commitment to empowering physicians, KIC Ventures has become the world's largest private equity firm with a majority-owned portfolio of differentiated spine companies focused on outpatient spine solutions.

First Half 202 5 Financial Results Total revenues for the first half of 2025 were RMB585.1 million (US$81.7 million)[1], a 14.2% year-over-year decrease. Hotel revenues were RMB488.0 million (US$68.1 million), a 9.5% year-over-year decrease due to an 11% year-over-year decrease in blended RevPAR across the first half year and the closure of 9 L&O hotels since the third quarter of last year. The decrease was partially offset by revenues from new openings. Restaurant revenues were RMB97.7 million (US$13.6 million), a 31.6% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the decrease in the number of L&O stores and lower ADS in the second quarter low season. Total revenues from leased-and-operated, or L&O, hotels and restaurants were RMB253.6 million (US$35.4 million)[1], a 20.3% year-over-year decrease. Total revenues from L&O hotels were RMB 194.8 million (US$27.2 million)[1], a 14.7% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was primarily attributable to the closing of 9 L&O hotels since the third quarter of last year, a 3.4% year-over-year decrease in RevPAR, and a reduction in sublease revenues mainly due to lease expiration. Total revenues from L&O restaurants were RMB59.1 million (US$8.2 million)[1], a 34.1% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the closure of 13 L&O restaurants since the third quarter of 2024 and the year-over-year decrease in ADS. Total revenues from franchised-and-managed, or F&M, hotels and restaurants were RMB294.9 million (US$41.2 million), a 5.7% year-over-year decrease. Total revenues from F&M hotels were RMB291.8 million (US$40.7 million)[1], a 5.6% year-over-year decrease, primarily due to a 11% decrease in F&M hotels' blended RevPAR across the first half year and partially offset by new openings. Total revenues from F&M restaurants were RMB3.2 million (US$0.4 million)[1], a 15.7% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the year-over-year decrease in ADS and partially offset by new openings. Total revenues from wholesale and others were RMB36.5 million (US$ 5.1 million)[1], a 28.5% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the decline in the wholesale segment of the restaurant business. Total operating costs and expenses Operating costs were RMB370.3 million (US$51.7 million)[1], a 10.2% year-over-year decrease. Operating costs of the hotel business were RMB286.9 million (US$40.0 million)[1], a 0.9% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower depreciation and amortization and lower consumable, food and beverage caused by the closing of L&O hotels, partially offset by the rental increase caused by the renewal of certain lease agreements. Operating costs of the restaurant business were RMB84.1 million (US$11.7 million)[1], a 28.3% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly due to the closure of L&O stores. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB27.5 million (US$3.8 million)[1], a 19.6% year-over-year decrease. Selling and marketing expenses of the hotel business were RMB23.0 million (US$3.2 million)[1], a19.9% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly due to lower advertising expenses, traveling and meal expenses. Selling and marketing expenses of the restaurant business were RMB4.6 million (US$0.6 million)[1], an 18.4% year-over-year decrease. General and administrative, or G&A expenses were RMB90.2 million (US$12.6 million)[1], a 12.6% year-over-year decrease. G&A expenses of the hotel business were RMB79.7 million (US$11.1 million)[1], a 14.7% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization and lower consulting fees. G&A expenses of the restaurant business were RMB10.5 million (US$1.5 million)[1], a 33.6% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to lower staff related expenses. Other general expenses of the hotel business were RMB11.6 million (US$1.6 million)[1], a 1.2% year-over-year decrease. These expenses for the first half of 2025 include only the provisions for loan receivables related to franchisee loans. Gross profit was RMB214.7 million (US$30.0 million)[1], a year-over-year decrease of 22.1%. Gross margin was 36.7%, compared to 40.4% in the first half of 2024. Gross profit of the hotel business was RMB201.1 million (US$28.1 million)[1], a 19.5% year-over-year decrease. Gross profit of the restaurant business was RMB13.6 million (US$1.9 million)[1], a 47.0% year-over-year decrease. Income from operations was RMB91.5 million (US$12.8 million)[1] , compared to RMB156.7 million in the first half of 2024, with a margin of 15.6%. Income from operations of the hotel business was RMB93.0 million (US$13.0 million)[1] , compared to income from operations of RMB151.9 million in the first half of 2024, with a margin of 19.1%. Income from operations of the hotel business in the first half of 2024 included the gain form the disposal of a property. Excluding this impact and the impact from the closing of L&O hotels, as well as the impact of bad debts, income from operations purely related to operations decreased by approximately 12.1%. Income (loss) from operations of the restaurant business in the first half of 2025 was a loss of RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million)[1], compared to income from operations of RMB4.7 million in the first half of 2024, with a margin of -1.5%. Net income in the first half of 2025 was RMB198.8 million (US$27.7 million)[1], compared to net income of RMB119.6 million in the first half of 2024, and net margin was 34.0%. N et income of the hotel business was RMB200.6 million (US$28.0 million)[1], compared to a net income of RMB120.4 million in the first half of 2024, and net margin was 41.1%. Hotel net income was impacted by the divestment of our ownership in Argyle, the realized gain from an equity investment, foreign exchange losses, the closure of L&O hotels, and bad debt expenses driven by accounts receivables. Excluding these factors, net income decreased by almost 9.5%. Net income (loss) of the restaurant business in the first half of 2025 was a loss of RMB1.8 million (US$0.3 million)[1], compared to a net income of RMB3.7 million in the first half of 2024, and net margin was -1.9%. Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) [2] was RMB149.7 million (US$20.9 million)[1], a year-over-year decrease of 22.2%.

Core net income (non-GAAP) was RMB92.1 million (US$12.9 million)[1], a year-over-year decrease of 29.6%. The core net margin, defined as core net income (non-GAAP) as a percentage of total revenues, for the first half of 2025 was 15.7%, compared to 19.2% in the first half of 2024. Earnings per American Depositary Share, or ADS, (basic and diluted) were RMB1.99 (US$0.28)[1], increased from RMB1.19 in the first half of 2024. Core net income per ADS (basic and diluted) (non-GAAP) was RMB0.91 (US$0.13)[1], decreased from RMB1.29 in the first half of 2024. Cash flow- Operating cash inflow was RMB104.8 million (US$14.6 million)[1] as a result of income from operations. Investing cash inflow for the first half of 2025 was RMB77.0 million (US$10.8 million)[1], which was primarily due to the disposal of our ownership in Argyle. Financing cash outflow was RMB0.2 million (US$0.03 million)[1], due to the repayment of bank loans by the end of June 2025. C ash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, investments in equity securities and time deposits. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had total cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short term investments, investments in equity securities and time deposits of RMB2,034.9 million (US$284.1 million)[1],compared to RMB1,839.1 million as of December 31, 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to continued operating cash inflow and the divestment of our investment in Argyle. Guidance Based on our performance in the first half of 2025 and considering the impact from closure of certain L&O hotels due to lease expiration and business strategy adjustments, we adjust our previous revenue guidance for the hotel business to -10% to -13% year-over-year. Dividend distribution The board of directors has approved the payment of a cash dividend of US$0.06 per ordinary share, or US$0.06 per American Depositary Share (""ADS"") payable to holders of the Company's ordinary shares shown on the Company's record at the close of trading on October 31, 2025 (the ""Record Date""). Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and core net income, as we present them, are useful financial metrics to assess our operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions, income taxes and certain non-core and non-recurring items in our financial statements. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business. The use of Adjusted EBITDA and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance. Depreciation and amortization expense for various long-term assets, income tax and share-based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and core net income do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest expense/income, gains/losses from investments in equity securities, income tax expenses, share-based compensation, share of loss in equity investees, government subsidies and other relevant items both in our reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. The terms Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When assessing our operating and financial performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA and core net income may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and core net income or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and core net income in the same manner as we do. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and core net income, to the consolidated statement of operations information are included at the end of this press release.

These agreements are the first to be reached under the Georgia PSC's newly approved rules and regulations, which are designed to provide Georgia Power with the flexibility to sustainably serve large-load customers while safeguarding residential and small business customers from additional costs. The company recently filed testimony with the Georgia PSC outlining how new contracts — driven largely by projected data center growth and other large-load customers — reinforce the need for additional generation resources to meet projected future demand. The filing is part of the ongoing All-Source Request for Proposals (RFP) certification proceeding and includes updates on projected customer demand, economic growth, and the company's load forecast. Georgia Power remains in active negotiations with multiple large-load customers representing several additional gigawatts of potential demand. Following the Georgia PSC's approval of updates to rules and regulations for the company earlier this year, potential large-load customers must now meet more stringent criteria — including providing financial commitments and demonstrating infrastructure readiness — to remain in the company's long-term development pipeline. These enhanced requirements help ensure that only the most credible and viable projects are included in Georgia Power's risk-adjusted load forecast. This growing pipeline of high-demand customers is a key factor enabling the company's three-year base rate freeze (excluding storm costs), helping to spread fixed costs across a broader customer base and protect residential and small business customers. Overall future customer demand remains strong with Georgia Power's risk-adjusted forecast projecting increased demand into the next decade, including 8,448 megawatts (MW) of projected growth between the winters of 2025/2026 and 2030/2031. Combined with continued progress on new customer contracts, this outlook further supports the company's request to certify approximately 9,900 MW of new capacity resources through the All-Source RFP, helping to ensure that Georgia's energy infrastructure keeps pace with economic development, and maintains reliable, resilient energy for customers. ""As Georgia continues to grow, our planning and forecasting teams are working every day to review the latest economic trends and customer data in coordination with our regulators at the Georgia PSC,"" said Aaron Mitchell, senior vice president for Strategic Growth for Georgia Power. ""These new contracts reflect not only the state's economic momentum, but also our commitment to protecting residential customers while responsibly planning for future energy needs."" New Rules & Regulations Provide Flexibility, Protect Customers In January, the Georgia PSC approved new rules and regulations that enable Georgia Power to serve large-load customers through customized contracts — including terms such as upfront infrastructure payments, long-term commitments, and financial guarantees — while helping ensure that residential and small business customers are shielded from bearing the costs associated with these high-demand projects.

Announces Permian Growth Projects and an Expansion of its Permian to Mont Belvieu NGL Pipeline Transportation System,"HOUSTON, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) (“Targa” or “the Company”) announced today new organic growth projects to support continuing NGL and natural gas production growth in the Permian Basin and to meet the infrastructure needs of its customers. With ~1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) currently being transported on Targa’s existing NGL transportation system, including volumes from the Pembrook II plant that came online during the third quarter of 2025 in the Permian Midland and is currently running at high utilization, Targa is moving forward with plans to construct the Speedway NGL Pipeline (“Speedway”). Speedway will transport NGLs from Targa’s existing assets and future plant additions, including a new processing plant announced today, in the Permian Basin to Targa’s fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas. The project consists of ~500 miles of 30 inch diameter pipeline and associated infrastructure with an initial capacity of ~500 thousand barrels per day (“MBbl/d”), expandable to 1,000 MBbl/d. Speedway is expected to be in-service in the third quarter of 2027 at an estimated cost of approximately $1.6 billion. To accommodate future growth on Targa’s Permian Delaware system, the Company is also moving forward with the construction of its next 275 million cubic feet per day (“MMcf/d”) gas processing plant, the Yeti plant, which is expected to be in-service in the third quarter of 2027. Including the Yeti plant, Targa is constructing five gas processing plants in the Permian that will be online over the next two years, with an aggregate inlet capacity of 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (“Bcf/d”) and estimated NGL production of ~175 to 200 MBbl/d. Targa also announced today a new 35-mile natural gas pipeline that will enhance connectivity across several Targa plants in the Permian Midland and a 55-mile conversion of an existing Targa pipeline into natural gas service (together ""Buffalo Run"") that will connect Targa's Midland and Delaware intra-basin natural gas systems. The combination of Buffalo Run and Targa's previously announced Bull Run Extension will enhance connectivity to multiple markets, including the Waha hub, and will add meaningful natural gas flow assurance and reliability for Targa's customers. Including the pipeline conversion, Buffalo Run is expected to be completed in stages and fully complete in early 2028. With today’s announcement of Speedway, Buffalo Run and the Yeti plant, Targa now estimates total net growth capital expenditures for 2025 to be around $3.3 billion, including already ordered pipe for Speedway and long-lead items already ordered for the Yeti plant. “We have benefited from meaningful volume growth across our Permian Basin assets this year, and our outlook for volume growth in 2026 continues to remain robust. Given the NGLs currently flowing through our system and numerous plant additions in progress, we will have significantly more volumes to move on Speedway when it comes into service. The strength of our outlook over the near, medium and long term is supported by multiple factors, including our continued volume ramp during the third quarter, the bottom-up forecast we see from our customer base, and the continued industry trend of rising gas-to-oil ratios in the basin. Speedway is critical to the continued execution of our core integrated wellhead to water strategy, will generate attractive and growing fee-based cash flows, and will provide Targa with significant operating leverage once in service,” said Matt Meloy, Targa’s Chief Executive Officer.

Reminds Investors of Tronox, Savara, Quantum, and Fly-E that Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Tronox Holdings plc (NYSE:TROX), Savara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA), Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO), and Fly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Tronox Holdings plc (NYSE:TROX) - Class Period: February 12, 2025, to July 30, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025 - According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Tronox’s ability to forecast the demand for its pigment and zircon products or otherwise the true state of its commercial division, despite making lofty long-term projections, Tronox’s forecasting processes fell short as sales continued to decline and costs increased, ultimately, derailing the Company’s revenue projections. - On July 30, 2025, Tronox announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, revealing a significant reduction in TiO2 sales for the quarter. The Company attributed the decline to “softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics.” As a result of the setback in sales, defendants revised the Company’s 2025 financial outlook lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%. - Following this news, Tronox’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $5.14 per share on July 30, 2025, Tronox’s stock price fell to $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, a decline of about 38% in the span of just a single day. - For more information on the Tronox lawsuit go to: Savara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA) - Class Period: March 7, 2024 to May 23, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025 - According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI Biologics License Application (""BLA"") lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; and (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital. - Plaintiff alleges that on May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release ""announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file (""RTF"")] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap]."" Specifically, Savara revealed that ""[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC)."" On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025. - For more information on the Savara lawsuit go to: Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO) - Class Period: November 15, 2024, to August 18, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025 - According to the lawsuit, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Quantum Corporation improperly recognized revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025; (2) as a result, Quantum Corporation would need to restate its previously filed financial statements for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. - For more information on the Quantum lawsuit go to: Fly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE) - Class Period: July 15, 2025, to August 14, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025 - According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to the Company's projected revenue outlook and anticipated sales. In truth, Fly-E's optimistic revenue goals and demand for its EV products and services fell short of reality; defendants continually praised Fly-E's brand reputation in the industry, cost reductions and favorable pricing from suppliers as a key component for Fly-E's ability to grow its sales network, while simultaneously minimizing risks associated with its lithium battery, supply chain changes and the regulatory environment and possible demand fluctuations for its E-Bikes and E-Scooters. - On August 14, 2025, Fly-E filed with the SEC a form NT 10-Q: Notification of inability to timely file Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The filing revealed a significant 32% decrease in Fly-E's net revenue compared to the same period in 2024. Notably, defendants stated that the primary driver for the revenue decrease was a decline of ""total units sold"" as customers were less inclined to purchase E-Bikes due to an ""increasing number of lithium battery explosion incidents in New York"". Although there was mention of sector wide lithium battery incidents in the 10-K filed on July 15, 2025, none were specific to Fly-E's lithium battery. Further, Defendants reiterated the fact that the EV industry is ""subject to extensive environmental, safety and other laws and regulations, which include products safety and testing, as well as battery safety and disposal."" On this news, the price of Fly-E's declined dramatically, from a closing market price of $7.76 per share on August 14, 2025, to $1.00 per share on August 15, 2025, a decline of about 87% in the span of just a single day. - For more information on the Fly-E lawsuit go to: About Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.

Investigation Seeks to Answer the Question -- Hagens Berman,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hagens Berman, a prominent shareholder rights law firm, is probing Coty Inc. (NYSE: COTY), one of the world’s largest beauty companies. The investigation follows a significant 21% drop in Coty's stock price on August 21, 2025, after the company disclosed what it called ""retailer inventory destocking issues"" alongside its weak Q4 and full-year financial results. Hagens Berman is looking into whether Coty may have misled investors about its growth trajectory and the success of its digital inventory strategy, known as SAP S/4HANA. The firm urges investors in Coty who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Visit: Contact the Firm Now: 844-916-0895 Coty Inc. (COTY) Investigation: Since August 2024, Coty has repeatedly stated that its digital transition “went off without a hitch.” However, the recent disclosures about retailer “destocking”—a term for retailers reducing their excess inventory—appear to be at odds with those earlier, optimistic claims. The investigation is exploring whether Coty may have been deliberately shipping excess inventory to its retail partners to mask its own inventory buildup and meet its earnings expectations, an undisclosed sales practice that would be misleading to investors. The August 21 earnings report revealed a steep year-over-year revenue decrease in both the Prestige and Consumer Beauty segments, which make up about 65% and 35% of the company's revenue, respectively. The company blamed this weak performance, in part, on the same retailer inventory issues it had previously downplayed. This revelation led to a swift and sharp decline in the stock’s value, which has not recovered. Hagens Berman’s Investigation on Behalf of Investors Hagens Berman is now investigating whether Coty and its executives made material misrepresentations that kept investors in the dark about the company’s true financial condition. “The question for us is whether Coty’s management may have intentionally downplayed the inventory problems to present an overly optimistic picture to the market,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Samsung Securities and UBS are serving as joint lead underwriters. Founded in 2019, SEMIFIVE has been providing comprehensive end-to-end AI ASIC solutions to a wide range of clients—including fabless companies and OEM device manufacturers—covering everything from AI chip specification and logic design to full production support. The global semiconductor industry is undergoing a significant transformation. As Moore's Law approaches its limits and the cost of AI accelerators rises sharply, demand is rapidly shifting away from general-purpose chips such as GPUs and CPUs toward customized ASICs. Capitalizing on this trend, SEMIFIVE's new order volume has surged nearly 17-fold in just four years, increasing from KRW 5.7 billion in 2020 to KRW 28.6 billion in 2022, and reaching KRW 100 billion in 2024. Industry experts attribute this growth to SEMIFIVE's platform-based design strategy. The company leverages its proprietary semiconductor design platform to maximize development efficiency in both time and cost, while also offering turnkey E2E (End-to-End) solutions that support the entire chip development lifecycle—from design to mass production. SEMIFIVE's AI ASIC business model is designed for sustainable growth: as development projects transition into mass production, revenue growth accelerates. With multiple projects currently entering the production phase, the company anticipates that its growth trajectory will gain further momentum. ""In the rapidly evolving AI semiconductor market, shortening time-to-market is key to securing competitiveness,"" said a SEMIFIVE spokesperson. ""SEMIFIVE is one of the few companies capable of supporting the entire AI ASIC development cycle swiftly and in accordance with customer requirements."" Building on its success in Korea, SEMIFIVE has accelerated its global expansion since 2025, securing consecutive AI semiconductor design projects from clients in the U.S., China, and Japan. Proceeds from the upcoming IPO will be used to ensure the smooth execution of SEMIFIVE's growing pipeline of mass-production projects, accelerate R&D in advanced design technologies such as chiplets, and further expand its global operations while strengthening the development of engineering talent. ""Our vision is to lead innovation in chip design for the era of custom AI semiconductors, just as foundries drove breakthroughs in manufacturing during the age of general-purpose CPUs and GPUs,"" said Brandon Cho, CEO and co-founder of SEMIFIVE. ""The surge in new orders signals a new wave of innovation in design. Through this IPO, SEMIFIVE will proactively address the growing demand for AI ASICs while scaling our capabilities to grow alongside global semiconductor leaders.""
