We report satisfactory earnings in Denmark, where developments are going as planned, and I expect a continuing gradual improvement going forward. Although demand in the Nordic market remains low, I note that market activities are improving in several locations and interesting customer dialogues are ongoing. The order backlog increased in Norway and Denmark during the quarter. Net sales and EBITA I am pleased that we, in a challenging market have increased both our margin and our earnings despite lower sales. Important factors for the margin development are our focus on margin before volume and the current project mix. Additional factors include our focus on restrictive project selection, cost control and pricing, as well as efficient production. Over the past year, our restrictive project selection has resulted in lower sales for both service and installation. However, this is a priority we are pleased to have, in order to be able to maintain the necessary balance between a focus on profitability and risk exposure. The variation in the market between different geographic areas is significant. Demand remains weak in the southern parts of Sweden and in the Finnish market, but also in other local markets. We continuously adapt our resources to the current market situation. The order backlog increased by almost SEK 1.3bn during the quarter, driven by a strong order intake in Denmark. The order backlog points to a stable installation volume in the coming quarters. The weak market situation in southern Sweden continues to have a negative impact on sales and profitability in the Swedish business. The business in southern Sweden lost 18 percent of its volume compared to the second quarter of 2024, corresponding to approximately SEK 230 million. Adjustments made to the organisation in southern Sweden have stabilised the EBITA margin, which is still at a low level. Other business operations in Sweden are stable. The Norwegian operations improved its project margins, which resulted in an improved EBITA margin. Organic growth was negative, as we had high production in a number of large projects in 2024. The project market in Norway remains challenging and it is important to keep adhering to our strategy of margin before volume. The Danish operations continues to develop in a positive direction. During the quarter, profitability improved significantly; this is in line with my previously communicated expectations. I expect a continuous improvement in profitability in the coming quarters, as new orders have good margins and sales from old loss-making projects are gradually decreasing. My assessment is that we will increase the EBITA margin close to 5 percent in 2025. The Finnish operations experienced a decrease of 15 percent in sales, but despite this decrease we managed to achieve acceptable profitability by adapting the organisation and costs to the current market situation. Cash flow Cash flow from operating activities and cash conversion declined. This was mainly due to an increase in accrued but not yet billed revenue in a large infrastructure project with a public sector client. The agreement with the customer stipulates that certain milestones have to be reached before invoicing can take place, and I expect this will occur in the second half of 2025. Acquisitions During the quarter, one acquisition was completed, which added annual sales of approximately SEK 346 million; at the beginning of the third quarter another acquisition was completed and this added annual sales of approximately SEK 45 million. As always, we focus on selecting the right acquisition candidates, which have a suitable culture and create value for Bravida. At present, identifying good acquisition targets is difficult, due to the weak and uncertain market conditions, but I want to emphasise that interesting acquisition discussions are ongoing continuously. Sustainability At Bravida, we take a long-term approach to sustainability in order to be a preferred supplier to our customers, an attractive employer and a leading stakeholder in the industry. I am very proud of the dedicated work we are putting into reducing workplace injuries is paying off. The LTIFR improved to 5.2, which is better than our current target of 5.5. The electrification of our vehicle fleet is reducing our own carbon footprint, and during the last 12 months we have reduced emissions from our vehicles by 15 percent, and by 40 percent from 2020 in relation to sales. Outlook For Bravida, I believe that the demand for service will remain stable. The installation volume will gradually improve, and benefit from a need for renovations, and investments in infrastructure, electrification and defence facilities. I have noticed a significantly better activity in the market, with more enquiries and interesting discussions, not least relating to infrastructure. However, there are considerable geographical differences in the demand for installation work relating to new builds. The markets in southern Sweden and Finland are still weak, whereas the market situation in the rest of Sweden, Denmark and Norway is generally stable, but with considerable geographical differences. We generally expect a continuing uncertain and hesitant market in 2025, impacted by the weak construction market and increased uncertainty in the world in general. For 2026–2027, the outlook is brighter, with increased demand for installation in new builds and renovation projects, according to third-party forecasts.

Outlook and guidance Finnair’s guidance regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result for 2025 has been clarified following the end of industrial action. Guidance excluding any direct impact of industrial action is unchanged. However, Finnair specifies that, based on the current information, the comparable operating result is estimated to be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Under Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025, the company provides additional information on the impacts of industrial action, as well as an estimate of capacity growth, revenue and comparable operating result in 2025, considering the direct impacts of industrial action. Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability and the threat of trade wars cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts are elevated. Excluding the direct impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. In 2025, profitability is further burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the second quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates above regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include direct impacts of industrial action. In total, the direct negative impact of industrial action in 2025 is estimated to be approximately 100 million euros on revenue, approximately 70 million euros on comparable operating result and approximately 5% on the total capacity, measured by ASKs. In the first half of 2025, industrial action had a direct impact of around -72 million euros on revenue and around -51 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, the three days of industrial action in July and the flights cancelled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following industrial action, including wet lease out flights, are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 25 million euros, other operating income by approximately 5 million euros and comparable operating result by approximately 20 million euros in the third quarter. Based on the cancellations confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a direct negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Considering the direct negative impacts of industrial action, Finnair plans to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 5% year-on-year and estimates its revenue to be within the range of 3.2–3.3 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 30–130 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the interim report January–September 2025. Previous outlook and guidance issued on 29 April 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability, the threat of trade wars and a tense labour market situation in Finland cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts have increased. Excluding the impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. In 2025, profitability is burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the first quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include impacts of industrial action. In the first quarter of 2025, industrial action had a negative impact of around 31 million euros on revenue and around 22 million euros on the comparable operating result. In April 2025, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of around 15 million euros on revenue and around 10 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, regardless of the duration of industrial action, Finnair has decided to cancel 230 flights scheduled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following the industrial action, which is estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 30 million euros and the comparable operating result by approximately 10 million euros. Based on the cancellations already confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the 2025 half-year report. CEO Turkka Kuusisto: The challenges Finnair faced at the beginning of the year continued into the second quarter. We carried over 3 million passengers, and our revenue grew slightly compared to the same period last year. However, our comparable operating result was particularly burdened by industrial action by the Finnish Airline Pilots’ Association in April and by the ground service personnel’s Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) in May and June. I want to extend my heartfelt apologies to each customer whose travel plans were disrupted by the industrial action. We reached collective labour agreements with the pilots, cabin crew, and travel agency staff during the quarter. The Service Sector Employers Palta and the IAU also came to an agreement after the period, so we are once again able to operate our flights with the reliability that is expected of us. The direct negative impact of the prolonged industrial action on second quarter revenue was around 41 million euros, on other operating income around 10 million euros, and on the comparable operating result around 29 million euros. We had to cancel over 1,300 flights during the quarter due to the industrial action, incurring costs related to customer rerouting and care, as well as compensation for delays. To support our customers’ important travel plans, we allowed them to reschedule flights away from the disruption days without additional fees, which reduced sales on the days to which flights were moved. The uncertainty caused by the disruptions also affected demand for our flights and customer satisfaction. Restoring customer trust and satisfaction is of primary importance to us, and we are systematically working towards this by taking care of our customers and their needs as well as possible, both in the development of our product and services and in our daily operations. Despite the disruptions caused by industrial action, our operational quality remained high, and we were able to operate 94% of our flights as planned. During the summer season, we operate about 350 flights per day, and even on disruption days, we managed to operate 60–75% of our flights. We have invested in improving the customer experience, particularly in terms of the smoothness of rerouting and customer communication, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of industrial action on our customers during the important summer travel season. During the quarter, general market uncertainties increased, which began to affect demand for transatlantic flights, and customers’ booking windows became shorter. Our North American traffic grew significantly, but the growth rate was more moderate than previously planned, and average ticket fares in the area declined. In other markets, demand developed as expected. We continued optimising our network and announced new summer 2026 routes to Toronto, Canada, and Alta in Northern Norway. We also added flights to Finnish Lapland for the winter 2025 season. In June, air travellers chose Finnair as the Best Airline in Northern Europe for the 15th consecutive time, and our cabin crew was also named the best in Northern Europe. This recognition is owed especially to Finnair employees in the front line who work with dedication every day to ensure safe and smooth flights.

Group operating income included a positive effect from the divestment of the Kelvinator trademark portfolio in India of SEK 180m. * Income for the period amounted to SEK 178m (-80) and earnings per share were SEK 0.66 (-0.30). * Operating cash flow after investments was SEK -741m (1,226), negatively impacted by an increase in working capital and the payment of the previously communicated French antitrust fine. President and CEO Yannick Fierling’s comment Market outperformance in North America, amid uncertain market conditions Organic sales growth was slightly positive in the quarter at 1.8%, driven by North America and Latin America. Business area Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa reported a slight organic sales decline, with a negative price development. In Europe, our main brands continued to outperform the market, whereas the general market demand declined somewhat with increased competitive pressure, and replacement driven demand. In North America, market demand declined slightly in the quarter, and we continued to outperform the market. In both Europe and North America, consumers continue to shift to lower price points and demand was impacted by uncertainty due to ongoing geopolitical developments. In Latin America, consumer demand increased slightly. As anticipated, in Brazil, growth was hampered by inflationary pressure and increased interest rates. Business area Latin America reported slight organic sales growth. Improved operating earnings with positive contribution from North America Operating margin improved, with a positive contribution from North America where list price increases offset increased costs related to U.S. tariffs introduced in the quarter. The competitive pressure and promotional activity were high in the quarter. Latin America continued to deliver an operating margin above our Group mid-term target of 6%. In Europe, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, the underlying operating income was lower mainly due to a negative price development. Operating cash flow was negative, impacted by a seasonal increase in working capital, a negative impact related to U.S. tariffs and a payment of the earlier announced French antitrust fine. Our market and business outlook for the year remains unchanged, and we reiterate our aim to offset tariff-related cost increases in North America through price increases. Looking ahead, consumer centricity and transformation in focus In the quarter, we executed well on our long-term strategic priorities. We continued our journey to strengthen our brands, with new marketing campaigns to support recently launched innovations. In the U.S. we are currently launching new Frigidaire ovens with stone-baked pizza mode. North America has been a focus point for improvements, and in the quarter, the business area reported a positive operating income. We continued to make good progress on cost-efficiency measures, delivering cost savings from procurement as well as product engineering. Maintaining a consumer-centric approach, as well as increasing speed and agility, are key components of our strategy. In the coming quarter, we will increase our focus on the major transformation areas and to drive speed and agility. The second quarter results demonstrate our commitment to deliver on our strategic priorities amid challenging market conditions.

Revenue (standard metal prices) is expected to be approximately EUR 2.65-2.75bn (previously approximately 2.37-2.52bn) and operational EBITDA is expected to be approximately EUR 360-390m (previously approximately EUR 330-380m). The financial outlook is subject to several assumptions including: Satisfactory execution of high-voltage projects and investments to deliver on expected profitability margins Satisfactory operational execution across business lines Stable market conditions for Applications and Service & Accessories Normalised offshore power cable repair work activity Stable supply chain with limited disruptions and access to the required labour, materials, and services Stable development in the global economy, foreign currency, and metal prices 13% organic growth and operational EBITDA of EUR 105m In Q2 2025, NKT’s revenue (in std. metal prices) amounted to EUR 723m, an increase of EUR 118m compared to Q2 2024, corresponding to 13% organic growth. In Solutions, the growth was driven by a high activity level and overall satisfactory project execution, while the increased revenue in Applications was driven by the acquisition of SolidAl in June 2024, and organic growth from additional medium-voltage production capacity. In Service & Accessories, revenue growth was driven by a higher activity level in the Accessories business. Operational EBITDA increased to a record-high level of EUR 105m in Q2 2025 compared to EUR 86m in Q2 2024. The increase was driven by the Applications and Service & Accessories business lines. The operational EBITDA margin* was 14.5%, slightly above the 14.2% reported in Q2 2024. At end-Q2 2025, the high-voltage order backlog was EUR 10.1bn (EUR 8.9bn in standard metal prices) compared to EUR 10.7bn (EUR 9.4bn in standard metal prices) at end-Q1 2025. During the quarter, NKT supplemented its high-voltage order backlog with a number of relatively smaller orders, including variation orders to existing projects.

CEO COMMENTS: FOCUSED ON OUR STRENGTHS, UNITED IN OUR PURPOSE – BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE Our overall group Q1 results reflect a quiet quarter for PC/Console releases. This year will be a transition year in terms of own major releases, and we will be highly focused on operational and strategic execution. Coinciding with the expected listing of Coffee Stain Group towards the end of 2025, Embracer will evolve into Fellowship Entertainment, an IP-first company powered by great creators and strong franchises in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. Through initiatives to improve and simplify our business, combined with a stronger release slate, we have the foundation for great long-term value creation. STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN OUR CREATIVE TALENT AND IP PORTFOLIO Over the last year we have made significant progress in transforming the group. Asmodee was successfully listed in February and we significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Coffee Stain Group is on track for its separate listing later this calendar year. With a powerful combination of strong IPs, engaged communities, and innovative talent, we are confident in its future as a standalone company. As Embracer evolves from a collective to a cohesive business in Fellowship Entertainment it will hold one of the most exciting IP portfolios in the industry with globally recognized franchises including The Lord of the Rings, Tomb Raider, Kingdom Come Deliverance, Metro, Dead Island, Darksiders and Remnant. We are laying the groundwork for a more agile and more empowered organization centered around such IPs. In our first quarter, organic growth amounted to -2% with net sales of SEK 3.4 billion and an adjusted EBIT of SEK 75 million, down from SEK 579 million in Q1 last year, or around SEK 250 million excluding the divested assets Easybrain and Gearbox. At the same time, our capex is down to SEK 784 million in Q1 from SEK 967 million a year prior excluding divested assets. On a trailing 12-month basis, free cash flow improved to SEK 1.2 billion, compared to SEK -0.2 billion in the preceding period. These are important steps with regards to underlying cash flow generation. The quarter saw a contribution in line with our expectations from our Mobile and Entertainment & Services businesses, but the quarter was slower than expected for PC/Console due to softness in our catalog. We continue to be excited that Kingdom Come Deliverance II is widely regarded as a Game of the Year contender. In Q1 several competitor games launched, taking player time and attention with the result that we saw a slowing in our gamer acquisition for Kingdom Come Deliverance II. We responded by doubling down on all efforts for Q2 and beyond; our teams are focused on expanding the game’s reach with major new content drops. We have seen an impact from these efforts already in early Q2. Legacy of the Forge, the second expansion, to be released this fall, will add real gameplay depth to increase engagement, with a third expansion scheduled for the holiday season. Touching on Q2, Killing Floor 3, released in July, has seen a mixed reception and has performed slightly below our initial expectations. With upcoming updates and open communication with players, we believe the game has made a solid enough start and can deliver long-term value. On August 1, Titan Quest II started in early access with encouraging engagement and player feedback after an extended period of time in development. We now look forward to expanded content and a full release, including on console, for this action RPG game that stands out in the marketplace. NEAR-TERM FOCUS, LONG-TERM VALUE As we move forward, we are taking a conservative approach for this current year, reflecting a measured view on the timing and performance of our PC/Console release schedule in addition to potential continued softness in our catalog following Q1. This year is a transition period as we lay the foundations of Fellowship Entertainment and focus on building a business led by key IP and empowered teams, in a structure enabling focus and operational discipline. It is paramount that we concentrate on the quality and long-term value of our releases rather than chasing short-term gains. We now expect our current financial year to deliver at least SEK 1.0 billion in Adjusted EBIT. On the whole, versus last year, we have incorporated further release shifts of one or several of the more important releases currently scheduled for Q4, as well as a slower growth trajectory for Mobile, negative FX effects and lower catalog sales. This conservative view provides upside potential, which we will work tirelessly to realize. For Q2, we expect to be roughly in line with Q1 on Adjusted EBIT, driven by the performance of already-released titles in July and August. We see no material changes to the management expectations for FY 2026/27 and FY 2027/28. We have one of the most exciting pipelines in the industry and we still have 9 AAA games currently slated, excluding any AAA games financed by partners. As previously noted, one or a couple of these games will most likely slip into FY 2028/29, but we do see a clear increase in release cadence as compared to our average of just over 1 AAA game per year in the past five years. We expect the increased released pipeline in combination with lower fixed costs will notably improve free cashflow FY 2026/27 onwards. Coffee Stain Group is performing in line with expectations, with an intact outlook. We see that there are challenges related to Fellowship Entertainment and we fully recognize these. Nevertheless, we also see potential for great long-term value creation. In recent months, I’ve spent significant time listening to our teams and companies. As we move into this next phase of our transformation, I want to share three immediate priorities for myself and the management team to improve profitability and free cash flow: 1. IP-led focus – We are doubling down on our greatest strength: empowering talented teams to deliver unforgettable experiences based on globally loved IPs. We accomplish this by an increased capital allocation to our core IPs. Over many years and across hundreds of game releases, our core IP had 3.1x ROI vs non-core at 1.6x. Core IP stood for 20% of capex a year ago, is expected to reach 40% this year, and it could reach 80% longer term, as we continue to reduce investments into non-core IP. Game development cycles are 3-5 years, and we are almost 2 years into this transition. 2. Operational discipline – We are not just renaming our group, but significantly rewiring the business to create one powerhouse unit within PC/Console. This comes through smarter collaboration, increased streamlining, shared services and with AI as an increasingly supportive force. These factors will be key to unlocking value and expanding margins. 3. Targeted cost initiatives – We focus on continuous improvement as well as targeted cost initiatives relating to underperforming businesses, to free up capital to deploy with better returns. These initiatives could potentially include divestments. Assets that we so far have categorized as non-strategic had a negative Adjusted EBIT contribution of SEK 250 million and margin impact of 2% percentage points on a pro forma basis over the past twelve months. Our intention is to return excess cash to shareholders – either through dividend or share buybacks. Before this will be communicated and executed, we need to decide and communicate the intended balance sheet for Coffee Stain Group at listing, as well as adjust some banking agreements that we deem are more technical adjustments due to our solid net cash position. ACKNOWLEDGING CHALLENGES, BUT STAYING THE COURSE This is a pivotal moment. It’s time to channel our energy and sharpen our focus. Our ambition is simple and focused: lead with distinctive IP; deliver with clarity and discipline; and realize our full potential. The choices we make now will determine not just what we achieve, but who we become. It is both an honor and a deep responsibility to lead Embracer, soon to be Fellowship Entertainment into the next chapter. I am grateful to the Board, and to Lars in particular, for the trust and belief placed in me. Lars’ entrepreneurial legacy has built the foundations on which we now stand. We’re ready to shape what’s next.

While reported margins declined year-over-year, the 2023 results included extraordinary settlements and asset sales that boosted profitability. Adjusting for these one-time items reveals that 2024 represents the company’s strongest operational performance to date, providing a solid foundation for sustainable growth. ■ Continued profitable growth in Germany to EUR 4 786 thousand revenues from EUR 4 209 thousand million revenues in 2023. ■ Continued struggle in Pakistan with EUR 4 303 thousand revenues from EUR 4 512 thousand revenues in 2023. In local currency the Pakistani company grew its revenues and generated a small net profit. ■ Continued stable performance in the Swiss company with EUR 6 551 thousand revenues. ■ Continued amortization of loans, to EUR 2 083 thousand, compared to EUR 3 105 thousand on January 1, 2024, representing a reduction of EUR 1 022 thousand (33%). ■ Interest from loans reduced to EUR 116 thousand (from EUR 191 thousand in 2023). ■ Stable management and board with Magnus Sparrholm and Erik Strömstedt steering the business. ■ The consolidated equity increased to EUR 776 490 thousand after reaching positive territory of EUR 90 thousand in 2023. Management Comments In 2024, Talkpool strengthened its finances and developed a new strategy based on its original focus on telecom network services. Preparations for future growth were made while costs were kept to a minimum. 2024 marked the final year in Talkpool’s effort to stabilize, reduce debt, and realign its business. Cash flow improved but remained strained due to debt repayments. The motto ”Reduce to the MAX” does not only just refer to cost reducing but also to maximize potential for future growth. Talkpool continued to streamline its operations, improving gross profit margins to 27.0% from 24.7% the previous year. While operational performance appeared unchanged in 2024 at first glance, the underlying operational profit margins improved to all-time-high levels. Extraordinary events in 2023 (mainly a settlement for the Pakistan acquisition) and more cautious accounting practices affected the 2024 financial results. Global challenges, such as continued Russian aggression and political turmoil, intensified. Talkpool’s business remained resilient and stable despite these multiple global challenges. Talkpool has built numerous communication networks across all continents during the past 25 years. The company intends to improve these networks and the underlying infrastructure by using smart technology developed by partner companies. 2025: Starting growth After years of improving efficiency, selling assets, cutting costs, and streamlining the business, Talkpool entered a growth phase in 2025. Talkpool exhibited at several trade shows and initiated a search for technology solutions that can fuel future growth. Talkpool started 2025 with strong interim financial results. Growth reached 6.4% year-on-year (vs. Q1 2024) with EUR 4.2 million in revenues, 29.7% gross margin, 14.7% EBITDA margin, and 8.1% earnings after tax (EAT) in the first quarter of 2025. Long-term 2030 targets of EUR 40 million revenues and 14% EBITDA were published along with a vision centered around using technology powered by artificial intelligence. The Pakistani business continued to report poor financial results in early 2025 but signed new orders in Q2 2025 that are expected to bring growth and profitability from the second half of the year. This represents the first positive news from Pakistan in many years. The weakening of the US dollar by 11% and PKR by 14% in the first half of 2025 is reducing Talkpool’s revenues that are reported in EUR. The parent company Talkpool AG underwent an extraordinary audit from April to August 2025 whereby the valuation of the German company was increased based on an independent valuation by BDO of EUR 20.5 million to compensate for a reduction in valuation of the Pakistani asset. This audit exercise resulted in a strengthened balance sheet, but also approximately EUR 1.5 million in losses and approximately EUR 50 000 in additional audit costs. It will not be possible for Talkpool to pay dividends to its shareholders due to COVID loan covenants and financial constraints of the parent company. The first phase of an options scheme was successful. The share options increased 50-fold in value as the share price increased from EUR 0.45 in March 2024 to EUR 1.25 in mid-2025. The overall options scheme runs until 2031. Talkpool’s business in the Caribbean continues to perform well. Several opportunities for generating new revenue streams have emerged in the Americas. The German business continues to perform well but at a reduced growth rate. German management is working to increase revenue streams from new clients. The current mid-size business is tightly controlled and highly focused on cash flow generation. The company is shifting from repaying loans to fuelling growth. The benefits for shareholders, clients, and staff have become visible. Financial Information Total debt 2022 Q3 - 2024 Q4 (EUR) Net debt decreased to EUR 0.79 million by the end of 2024. The cash improved slightly to EUR 1.41 million despite repaying EUR 0.91 million debt in 2024. The extraordinary impact in 2024 was EUR 101 thousand. This is lower than EUR 116 thousand in 2023 and EUR 1 816 thousand in 2022. There was almost no impact on the income statement from extraordinary events in 2024. Talkpool Group reduced and strengthened its consolidated balance sheet: ■ Overall balance (total assets = total liabilities + equity) shrunk to EUR 5 654 thousand, down from EUR 6 242 thousand a year ago ■ Equity reached EUR 776 490 thousand, up from EUR 90 thousand a year earlier. EBITDA 2022 - 2024 (EUR) The underlaying operational business improved in 2024. The adjusted EBITDA increased to EUR 1.6 million from 1.2 million despite more conservative accounting practices. The Gross Margin increased to 27.0% (EUR 4.3 million) in 2024, from 24.6% (EUR 3.8 million) in 2023.

CEO Mikko Karvinen comments on the development during the period: Nexstim continued its positive trend in terms of net sales growth and improved results during the first half of 2025. In H1 2025, we achieved total net sales of EUR 4.5 (3.2) million, representing growth of 41.8%. Gross margin increased by more than EUR 1 million from the comparable period last year to EUR 3.6 (2.6) million, which is a result of the favorable development of our sales volumes and prices. The increased customs duties in the United States did not have a significant impact on the results for the first half of 2025, and we have sought to minimize the potential impact of customs duties on future periods by taking them into account in new system sales offers. We were particularly pleased with the positive development of EBITDA during the first half of the year. EBITDA was EUR 0.2 (-0.5) million and was positively record-breaking for two consecutive half-years. The operating result for the first half of the year also showed improvement in the right direction, at EUR -0.2 (-0.9) million, with a result for the review period of EUR -0.3 (-0.9) million. The result was improved by a non-recurring item of EUR 0.2 million, which was the first installment of the license fee for the exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica. I thank Nexstim's customers, personnel, partners, and investors for the continuation of this positive development. In line with the main objective of Nexstim's 2025–2028 strategy, we have focused on profitable net sales growth, and our sales forecast for full year 2025 looks promising. This growth is now supported by our global distributor partner network, which was strengthened at the end of last year by the Brainlab cooperation agreement. We are now looking to take immediate advantage of this, particularly in the marketing and sales of diagnostics systems in the United States and Europe. In early 2025, we developed and trained our partner network for the Diagnostics business in close cooperation with Brainlab. This will enable us to effectively and comprehensively deliver our sales and marketing message to as many markets as possible among Brainlab's thousands of existing customers. In addition to this collaboration, Nexstim's direct sales and marketing still have significant opportunities for developing the Therapy business, research and neuroscience customers, and the clinic partner network. We aim to continue leveraging our expert and efficient global teams to ensure positive profitability development. This was reflected in the moderate 11 percent growth in operating expenses in early 2025, enabling a simultaneous 40 percent increase in gross margin. Business update We have continued to grow our Diagnostics (NBS, Navigated Brain Stimulation) and Therapy (NBT ® , Navigated Brain Therapy and NBS 6) businesses through the sale of new systems in our key markets in the US and Europe. Our growing installed base generates a steady stream of net sales which increases the stability and predictability of our operations. The Diagnostics business grew by 65.3% during the first half of 2025, with net sales of EUR 2.5 (1.5) million. We delivered a total of seven new diagnostic systems during H1 2025. To date, we have sold more than 250 diagnostic systems to research universities and leading hospitals around the world. We are pleased that more of our customers want to use Nexstim system for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The NBS System 5 configuration, NBS 5+, has enabled the use of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the same system. This offering means that all FDA 510(k) indications are available in the same system on the US market. Most of the diagnostic systems delivered in early 2025 have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We consider combination systems to be a clear competitive advantage and aim to launch the latest generation of NBS 6 combination systems in key markets during the second half of 2025, following regulatory approvals. Net sales from the therapy business decreased by 8.4% during the first half of 2025 and amounted to EUR 1.4 (1.6) million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in system sales in the Therapy business, which fell by 37.0% compared to the same period last year. During H1 2025, we delivered one purely therapeutic system to Europe and the rest of the world. This development was mainly since most of the therapy applications were delivered in connection with Diagnostics and Research and Neuroscience system. At the end of June 2025, there were a total of 116 Nexstim systems with therapy applications installed worldwide (43 in the United States and 73 in Europe and the rest of the world) for the treatment of depression and chronic neuropathic pain. This number includes both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems as well as NBS systems with optional NBT add-on software installed. With the new strategy period, we now also report separately the net sales of the Research and Neuroscience business, which grew by as much as 565.7% during the first half of 2025, amounting to EUR 0.6 (0.1) million. This rapid growth was due to the sale of two research systems and a EUR 0.2 million license fee from Sinaptica's exclusive agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned system already delivered, we had an open order backlog of eight systems at the end of June 2025. In June 2024, we announced disagreements regarding the licensing of our technology to the US medical technology company Magnus Medical, Inc. Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems. The importance of partnerships is likely to increase in the future in the Therapy business as well, as we leverage our unique expertise and technology in emerging treatment areas. Our second strategic objective for 2025 is to successfully support the long-term collaboration between Nexstim and Brainlab and to expand our network of other partners and clinics, primarily in the United States. I strongly believe that combining Nexstim's technological expertise and first-class services with Brainlab's innovative products, which have significant business growth potential and are well suited to Nexstim's offering and global customer base of leading hospitals, will create maximum value for patients, neurosurgeons, hospitals, and shareholders. Outside of Brainlab's exclusive rights, Nexstim will continue to independently develop, market, and sell its products and services in all markets for current and future neuroscience research solutions and therapeutic applications. This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area. The gross margin target set for 2025 is EUR 4 million. The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system. The development and launch of a new product generation will continue to be an essential part of Nexstim's operations during the 2025–2028 strategy period. NBS 6 is a new combination system built on Nexstim's unique, clinically established technology, with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Nexstim's NBS 6 system has FDA marketing and distribution approval for the treatment of major depression in the United States and is CE-approved in Europe for the treatment of major depression and chronic neuropathic pain. We will now continue to finalize the development of the system and progress regulatory approvals during 2025 so that, in line with our strategic objective, we will also have diagnostic applications launched in the key markets as part of the new NBS 6 system. Building future growth paths Our system clearly stands out from other TMS systems currently on the market, which do not have navigation features. In the future, the need for navigation functionality is likely to become even more important in technology, enabling more diverse treatment of brain disorders. This may open new markets for Nexstim in TMS treatments beyond severe depression and chronic neuropathic pain. The technological leadership, ease of use, and scalability of our product create an attractive foundation for growth through partnerships. In January 2025, the company announced the start of joint development of the SinaptiStim ® precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease together with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. (""Sinaptica""). The company announced that the planned delivery of the research system for the first validation testing, and future clinical trials was in March. Nexstim announced that it is developing the system according to Sinaptica's specifications, combining it with a high-resolution 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system from Bittium, which enables precision calibration of the therapy for each Alzheimer's patient. The new research system will be used in Sinaptica's upcoming clinical trials related to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with several studies planned to begin in 2025. At the end of June 2025, the Company announced that it had signed an exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. regarding the companies' planned collaboration in the field of Alzheimer's disease treatment. The signed agreement covers plans for 2025. The final agreement is expected to be drafted and signed before the end of the year. In June 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent with Sinaptica regarding the development, manufacture, and supply of Sinaptica's patented precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The system is based on Nexstim's NBS 6 medical TMS and neuronavigation systems and related software, including integrated EEG software. As part of the signed exclusive agreement, Sinaptica undertakes to order the research system it needs for clinical trials from Nexstim, and Nexstim will not commercialize its technology in the field of Alzheimer's disease independently or with partners other than Sinaptica. The agreed exclusivity is conditional upon payments of EUR 1.5 million in multiple installments to Nexstim during 2025. The planned partnership would be a global, 10-year exclusive arrangement. The financial structure of the partnership consists of a signing fee for the disclosed exclusivity rights, a milestone-based development project, and the sale of clinical and commercial system. The milestone-based project and purchases of clinical system are defined in more detail in the final agreements, which may be subject to change during negotiations. The long-term exclusive rights arrangement also depends on payments to be made by Sinaptica during 2025 and the signing of final agreements before the end of 2025. Building shareholder value while taking exceptional circumstances into account Despite the tense global political situation, our expectations for the rest of 2025 are positive in many ways. Our current business is heavily focused on the EU and the US, but with our new partners, we will continue to actively expand Nexstim's technology into the Asian market. Nexstim will continue its determined efforts to develop personalized and effective methods for the treatment and diagnosis of severe brain diseases and disorders. We strongly believe that our work will support long-term shareholder value growth in the form of increasingly strong competitive advantages, rapid growth, and improved financial results. Nexstim’s business areas Diagnostics Business Nexstim’s NBS 5 system is the only CE-marked and FDA-cleared non-invasive solution for pre-surgical mapping of the motor cortex in brain cancer. Clinical data has been generated demonstrating the value of Nexstim’s unique navigation system for pre-surgical mapping with regard to patient outcomes. The system allows surgeons to be better prepared and more aggressive with tumor resection, due to their confidence in the location of the motor and speech cortex because of pre-surgical mapping. More than 250 diagnostic systems have been sold to research universities and leading hospitals across the world. Therapy Business Nexstim’s NBT ® and NBS 6 systems are based on its unique navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (nTMS) technology, which allows for personalized, accurate, reproducible, and non-invasive brain stimulation. In May 2018, Nexstim launched its Navigated Brain Therapy (NBT ® ) system in the United States for the treatment of MDD, following FDA clearance in November 2017. Nexstim launched the NBS 6 system for therapy use in 2024. The NBS 6 is a new generation Nexstim system with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems are CE marked for the treatment of major depression and chronic pain, and have FDA approval for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Active commercial installed base of 116 therapy systems across four continents (including both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems and NBS systems with optional NBT ® add-on software installed). Research and Neuroscience Business The core of the Research and Neuroscience business is the sale of Nexstim systems and support and development services to leading research hospitals and clinics, in order to support leading expert customers (key opinion leaders, KOLs) working in these institutions at the forefront of technological and clinical development. The international research community is particularly interested in developing therapies based on the stimulation of connections/neural networks between different areas of the brain. Nexstim's unique electric field neuronavigation has proven to be particularly useful and necessary in this regard. TMS-EEG diagnostics and treatment development based on this methodology are a growing area of interest in research. Here, too, neuronavigation and Nexstim's real-time EEG (electroencephalography) software are particularly useful and are attracting growing interest.

Comparable EBIT is expected to be EUR 85–105 million. TOKMANNI GROUP CEO MIKA RAUTIAINEN During the second quarter of 2025, Tokmanni Group’s revenue grew, driven especially by Dollarstore’s strong performance in non-grocery sales. Dollarstore segment’s revenue grew by 8.8% in local currencies, with like-for-like revenue up by 5.1%. Tokmanni segment’s like-for-like revenue grew by 0.8%, mainly due to higher sales of groceries and Easter products, while demand for spring and summer season products was weak. Nevertheless, customer visits increased across Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. The development of Tokmanni Group’s gross margin was twofold. We succeeded in improving Dollarstore segment’s gross margin after a weak first quarter, with comparable gross profit rising by EUR 5.0 million compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, Tokmanni segment’s comparable gross margin declined by 1.4 percentage points. The decline was mainly due to decreased sales of higher-margin non-grocery sales, particularly spring and summer season products and increased share of grocery sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. We were not able to manage our operating expenses in line with our targets. As a result, fixed costs in both segments increased faster than revenue, largely due to higher personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel costs were driven up by wage increases, new store openings, and increased working hours partly because of the harmonisation of replenishment and warehouse management systems at the Group level. The Group’s weaker result compared to the corresponding period of the previous year was mainly due to these increased operating expenses and the lower gross margin percentage mentioned earlier. Measures to improve profitability at Tokmanni and Dollarstore are proceeding. These actions include strict cost control, particularly regarding personnel and marketing expenses, as well as efforts to enhance the efficiency of supply chain and store operations. We are also continuing the integration of Dollarstore into Tokmanni Group. In addition, we continue to develop our store network in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.

Comparable EBIT is expected to be EUR 85–105 million. TOKMANNI GROUP CEO MIKA RAUTIAINEN During the second quarter of 2025, Tokmanni Group’s revenue grew, driven especially by Dollarstore’s strong performance in non-grocery sales. Dollarstore segment’s revenue grew by 8.8% in local currencies, with like-for-like revenue up by 5.1%. Tokmanni segment’s like-for-like revenue grew by 0.8%, mainly due to higher sales of groceries and Easter products, while demand for spring and summer season products was weak. Nevertheless, customer visits increased across Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. The development of Tokmanni Group’s gross margin was twofold. We succeeded in improving Dollarstore segment’s gross margin after a weak first quarter, with comparable gross profit rising by EUR 5.0 million compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, Tokmanni segment’s comparable gross margin declined by 1.4 percentage points. The decline was mainly due to decreased sales of higher-margin non-grocery sales, particularly spring and summer season products and increased share of grocery sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. We were not able to manage our operating expenses in line with our targets. As a result, fixed costs in both segments increased faster than revenue, largely due to higher personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel costs were driven up by wage increases, new store openings, and increased working hours partly because of the harmonisation of replenishment and warehouse management systems at the Group level. The Group’s weaker result compared to the corresponding period of the previous year was mainly due to these increased operating expenses and the lower gross margin percentage mentioned earlier. Measures to improve profitability at Tokmanni and Dollarstore are proceeding. These actions include strict cost control, particularly regarding personnel and marketing expenses, as well as efforts to enhance the efficiency of supply chain and store operations. We are also continuing the integration of Dollarstore into Tokmanni Group. In addition, we continue to develop our store network in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.

The full Half-Year Report is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at . KH Group, April-June 2025 Net sales amounted to EUR 54.2 (52.2) million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 0.8 (2.4) million. Operating profit was EUR 0.5 (2.1) million Net profit for the period from continuing operations was EUR -0.6 (0.6) million. Earnings per share from continuing operations were EUR -0.01 (0.01). KH Group January–June 2025 Net sales amounted to EUR 95.9 (92.5) million. Comparable operating profit was EUR 1.0 (2.3) million. Operating profit was EUR 0.4 (1.6) million. Net profit for the period from continuing operations was EUR -1.0 (-1.1) million. Earnings per share from continuing operations were EUR -0.02 (-0.02). Equity per share at the end of the review period was EUR 0.83 (1.25). Return on equity for rolling 12 months was -40.8% (-18.9%). The Group’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 3.1 million at the end of the review period. Gearing at the end of the review period was 288.8% (239.6%). Gearing excluding lease liabilities was 188.0% (153.8%). CEO Ville Nikulainen: The Group’s net sales from continuing operations increased, but operating profit decreased year-on-year during the April–June review period. KH-Koneet’s net sales increased and operating profit decreased. The machine dealership and rental business grew in Finland in terms of both net sales and operating profit. In Sweden, the machine rental business, in particular, generated lower net sales and operating profit than in the comparison period. Sales of heavy crawler excavators in Finland continued to increase year-on-year. Nordic Rescue Group’s net sales declined, but operating profit for the second quarter was on a par with the comparison period. The order book strengthened during the review period in both Finland and Sweden. KH Group announced in March 2025 that it had initiated a sale process for Indoor Group. KH Group has engaged a financial advisor to explore various options for its Indoor Group shareholding. No final decision has been made on the sale of Indoor Group holdings and there is no certainty as to the timing, terms or completion of any such transaction. KH Group aims to complete the process during 2025. In Indoor Group, the general uncertainty in the market continued to have a negative impact on net sales and operating profit. The extensive operating model reform programme to improve Indoor Group’s profitability targets an annual improvement in operating profit of at least EUR 10 million by the end of 2026. A significant part of the targeted profitability improvement is estimated to be realised already during 2025. The change negotiations concluded in December 2024 will generate annual savings in wage costs of approximately EUR 6–7 million, which improved the company's result significantly in the second quarter. In June 2025, Indoor Group carried out change negotiations related to the renewal of the management model and the reorganisation of functions. The aim was to identify measures to improve profitability by approximately EUR 2 million per year. The outcome of the change negotiations was that up to 21 employment relationships will be terminated in Indoor Group, and temporary lay-offs will be implemented by the end of May 2026. In March 2025, KH Group acquired the remaining KH-Koneet Group Oy minority shares in accordance with the shareholder agreement. As a result, KH-Koneet is now a fully-owned subsidiary of KH Group Plc. In May, the Board of Directors of KH Group Plc resolved to establish a performance share plan for KH-Koneet's key employees. The plan replaced the performance-based matching share plan announced on 31 May 2024. The purpose of the new scheme is to align the goals of shareholders and key employees in order to increase the company's shareholder value in the long term, guide the key employees to achieve the company’s strategic objectives, and offer them a competitive incentive scheme based on the earning and accrual of KH Group shares. In 2025, the business areas will focus on securing net sales and operating profit as well as improving the efficiency of working capital. KH Group’s change in strategy is being advanced according to plan.""

Nordic Rescue Group's operating profit was on par with the comparison period despite lower net sales. The parent company’s share of the operating profit for the review period was EUR -1.2 (-1.0) million. Financial expenses were substantially lower than in the comparison period due to lower interest rates, the amortisation of interest-bearing financial liabilities, and changes in exchange rates. Events after the review period There were no significant events after the review period. Financial objectives and future outlook KH Group’s objective is to become an industrial group built around the KH-Koneet business and to divest other business areas in line with the Group's strategy. At the same time, active developments will continue regarding other business areas. Exit planning and the assessment of exit opportunities for the other business areas will also continue. During the next few years, the aim is to invest in the growth of the core business and pay dividends after significant exits within the limits established by the balance sheet structure and financing agreements. The guidance with the current Group structure of continuing operations for 2025 is as follows: the company estimates that both the net sales (EUR 194.0 million) and the comparable operating profit (EUR 7.2 million) will remain approximately at the same level year-on-year.

Highlights DKK 8.5bn revenue – a 2% decrease DKK 706m EBITDA – a 4% decrease DKK 542m cash flow from operations – a 61% improvement DKK 10.18 earnings per share – a 3% decrease 12.5% ROIC excluding goodwill – a 1.3 pp decrease Full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance narrowed within previous range. Statement by Jens Bjerg Sørensen, President of Schouw & Co. – Schouw & Co. experienced a challenging yet stable second quarter of 2025, with consolidated revenue and EBITDA slightly down on the second quarter of 2024. The diversified portfolio provided stability amid global economic changes, particularly in Chinese export markets. Despite the global challenges, we generated a solid operational cash flow of DKK 542 million. Especially BioMar, GPV and HydraSpecma showed continued solid resilience, while Borg Automotive faced difficult market conditions. We maintain a positive outlook, narrowing our full-year 2025 guidance within the previously announced range. We have previously announced that we are investigating whether a potential separate listing of BioMar would create value for the shareholders of Schouw & Co. The preparatory work continued as expected during the past quarter, and a banking syndicate has been established. If found to be value-creating, the listing of BioMar on the Copenhagen stock exchange can take place in the first half of 2026 .

EBITDA was down by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million, and profit before tax (EBT) was down by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million. As announced on 10 July 2025, our full-year revenue guidance for 2025 has been lowered to a range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%), while our earnings margin guidance is maintained at an EBITDA margin of 19-21% and an EBT margin of 11-13%. We therefore expect to achieve revenue and earnings at the same level as the record year of 2024. The Board of Directors of SP Group A/S today considered and approved the interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2025, which includes the following highlights (all changes are calculated in relation to the first half of 2024): Revenue fell by 1.2% to DKK 1,466.9 million in H1. Revenue for Q2 was down by 10.7% year on year. Earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million in H1 for an EBITDA margin of 19.8%. EBITDA for Q2 was down by 18.8% to DKK 124.8 million for an EBITDA margin of 18.3%. Profit before tax (EBT) fell by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million in H1 for an EBT margin of 11.2%. EBT for Q2 was down by 30.6% to DKK 63.6 million for an EBT margin of 9.4%. H1 sales of own products declined by 11.5% to DKK 388.4 million. Own products accounted for 26.5% of revenue for the period. Sales of other products grew in H1, while Healthcare, Foodtech and Cleantech suffered a setback. Cash flows from operating activities were a net inflow of DKK 228.7 million in H1 against DKK 256.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 756.9 million at 30 June 2025, compared to DKK 923.8 million at 30 June 2024. At 31 December 2024, NIBD amounted to DKK 821.1 million. NIBD was 1.3x LTM EBITDA. NIBD fell by DKK 64.2 million in H1 2025. SP Meditec is nearing completion of its production ramp-up in Peachtree City, near Atlanta, USA. Due to a high number of customer projects, we are currently exploring options to expand production capacity further. In Poland, we have initiated the conversion of one of our factory buildings for the manufacturing of components for medical devices. Ergomat has successfully launched new sales activities in Asia, including in key markets such as India and Japan. We expect only marginal impact from a new US–EU trade agreement. SP Group expects revenue growth for FY 2025 in the range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%) for an EBITDA margin of 19-21%. Lars Bering, CEO: “ Following a record-breaking first quarter in terms of revenue and earnings, SP Group generated lower-than-expected sales and earnings in the second quarter of 2025 due to the postponement of several orders and projects during the period. The Q2 performance was impacted by ongoing geopolitical unrest, leading to increased uncertainty in global markets with several of our customers postponing the launch of new projects. However, we are pleased to see increased activity in the defence industry, which has led to several exciting projects for SP. Our subsupplier production grew in the course of H1 2025, as did the inflow of medical device industry projects, resulting in high activity levels at our US factory and the factories in Europe. ” For further information: CEO Lars Bering Phone: +45 70 23 23 79 Invitation: Presentation of interim report for the first half of 2025 In continuation of the release of this interim report, SP Group will host a webcast on 20 August 2025 at 1:00 p.m. (in Danish) and at 3:00 p.m. (in English).

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year.

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year. Free cash flow in Q2 was DKK 32 million, compared to DKK 26 million in Q2 2024. This improvement was driven by higher earnings and an improvement in the net working capital. CAPEX amounted to DKK 18.3 million (Q2 2024: DKK 12.0 million), mainly related to the ERP project and the new lacquering facility. The lacquering facility was completed during the quarter and is expected to ramp up fully during the present quarter. After acquiring 45% of the online retailer Celebert ApS in 2021, we have now agreed to acquire the remaining 55% following the decision of the majority shareholder to exercise its put option. During the four years of co-ownership, Celebert has grown rapidly, and we are confident that, once the relevant regulatory approvals are in place, Celebert will continue this growth journey.

Bahnhof växer i Nordeuropa: • Norge: Kraftig tillväxt och strategiskt förvärv • Finland: Försäljningen ökar • Danmark: Bahnhof nu tillgängligt i fler nät • Tyskland: Säljstart 17 september Offensiv förvärvsstrategi: Bahnhof förvärvar Allentes bredbandskunder i Norge Datasäkerhet i krigets skugga: Bahnhof bygger IT-bunker i Göteborg Första halvåret 2025 i sammanfattning Omsättning: 1085,0 Mkr (992,3 Mkr) Resultat före avskrivningar (EBITDA): 167,9 Mkr (163,3 Mkr) Rörelseresultat (EBIT): 140,6 Mkr (130,9 Mkr) Resultat efter skatt: 114,5 Mkr (109,0 Mkr) Resultat efter skatt per aktie: 1,06 SEK (1,02 SEK) Nettomarginal: 13,4% (14,1%) Detta är en sammanfattning. Fullständiga siffror finns i den finansiella delen av rapporten. Siffror inom parentes avser motsvarande period januari till och med juni 2024. Fortsatt tillväxt i Norden med starka marginaler – nytt förvärv i Norge! Första halvåret 2025 präglas av fortsatt tillväxt med stabil lönsamhet. Rörelseresultatet ökar till 140,6 Mkr (130,9 Mkr), medan omsättningen stiger med 9,3 procent till 1 085,0 Mkr (992,3 Mkr). Nettomarginalen för delåret uppgår till 13,4 procent, vilket visar att Bahnhof lyckas hålla i marginalerna trots en offensiv utlandssatsning. De nya marknaderna är på god väg att utvecklas till en tillväxtmotor för koncernen. Vi finns nu i alla nordiska grannländer och inleder säljstart i Tyskland under början av hösten. Den organiska tillväxten på privatsidan i Sverige är fortsatt positiv, med villor och bostadsrätter som motor. Den 30 juni 2025 har Bahnhof i Sverige totalt 489 859 hushåll anslutna till någon av våra snabba fibertjänster – en organisk nettotillväxt på 1 297 nya kunder under det andra kvartalet. Det är för affärsområdet en starkare tillväxt än konkurrenter som Telia, Tele2 och Telenor (källa: bolagens publika rapportering för Q2). På företagssidan fortsätter Bahnhof att växa med stabila och blixtsnabba bredbandstjänster till kommersiella fastigheter och kontor. Vi har också förstärkt vår satsning på trådlösa höghastighetsnät för större privata och offentliga arbetsplatser. Det osäkra omvärldsläget driver på efterfrågan på kommunikations- och datatjänster i inhemsk regi. Mot den bakgrunden har vi påbörjat ett omfattande uppgraderingsprogram för både nät och datacenter. Det inkluderar även ett nytt strategiskt förvärv: ett av Sveriges största bergrum för industriproduktion i krigstid. Anläggningen, som byggdes av SKF under det kalla kriget för att skydda kullagertillverkningen, ligger strax utanför centrala Göteborg. Bahnhof tillträder i början av september. Finansiell situation i sammanfattning Kassaflödet för det första halvåret är -63,5 Mkr (-197,2 Mkr). Kassaflödet från verksamheten är i grunden mycket starkt, perioden belastas främst av en aktieutdelning på 215,1 Mkr (215,1 Mkr). Bahnhof har under perioden investerat totalt 34,2 Mkr (46,7 Mkr). Investeringarna avser löpande uppgraderingar av Bahnhofs nät och teknikplattformar på olika orter i Sverige, ett nytt ekonomisystem, renovering av kontorslokaler samt ett förvärv av en verksamhet i Norge. Den sista juni är likvida medel i Bahnhof 604,0 Mkr (560,6 Mkr). Vi placerar våra likvida medel med krav på god avkastning och låg risk, men med en särskild viktning för snabb tillgänglighet. Den starka kassan kommer att användas till investeringar i framtidsprojekt. Vi kommer att arbeta med kapitalet i tekniska och affärsmässiga nyinvesteringar i Sverige och utomlands. Förvärvsstrategin är aktivt sökande. Den utgår från en filosofi som bygger på att etablera nytt, eller att komplettera. Mogna och mer etablerade tjänster som vi redan driver byggs bäst i egen regi. Mål och vision Prognos 2025 Bahnhofs prognos för helåret 2025 är en omsättning på 2,2 miljarder kronor, med en rörelsemarginal på 12 procent. Prognosen bygger på vår analys och data om abonnemangsintäkter, samt vårt strategiska mål att ta marknadsandelar i Nordeuropa. Det senare kan komma att påverka de ekonomiska målen i ytterligare positiv riktning. Bahnhofs försäljning bygger på samma affärsmässiga principer som så kallade SaaS-bolag, som säljer innehåll och mjukvara med löpande abonnemang. De nya kunder som tillkommer blir en positiv del av Bahnhofs affär under många år. Vision Bahnhof ska vara en expansiv nordeuropeisk moln- och internetaktör som erbjuder säker, klimatsmart och innovativ kommunikationsteknik för företag och privatpersoner. Vi är offensiva, rörliga och vi tar tillvara alla möjligheter som följer av tekniska landvinningar. De tjänster vi bygger ska vara möjliga att skala upp, och tillhandahålla som löpande abonnemang. Bahnhofs styrka är innovationer och nytänkande, som förenas med en kostnadsmedveten och organisk tillväxt. Om kriget kommer Bahnhof organiserar verksamheten för en potentiell krigsfara. Vi planerar för att vara motståndskraftiga mot digitala eller väpnade angrepp på infrastruktur (egen och kunders). I samråd med Försvarsmakten har vi krigsplacerat personal i Bahnhof. Vi arbetar målmedvetet med datasäkerhet på olika områden. Det innefattar också skalskydd i bergrum. Bahnhof stödjer den ideella föreningen Totalförsvarets Förvaltningsorganisation med Bahnhof Cloud. Rysslands angreppskrig mot Ukraina Bahnhof stödjer väpnad och civil kamp mot Putins krig i Ukraina. Vi har donerat närmare ett ton nätverksutrustning till drönarförband. Ett antal av våra ukrainska medarbetare är i stridande förband vid fronten. Hållbarhetsdeklaration Bahnhof sätter människan i centrum! Vi värnar om individen och friheten på nätet. Strategiskt är våra kärnvärden nätneutralitet, kommunikationsfrihet och rätten till ett privatliv. Det är inte tomma ord. Vi tar ställning även i kontroversiella frågor där våra kärnvärden hotas. Vi står upp för våra kunder. Bahnhof driver teknik på ett sätt som inte i onödan gör av med energi eller äventyrar miljön. Bahnhof återanvänder energi i datacenter, och vi har ett återvinningsprogram för elektronik- och teknikutrustning. Bahnhof skapar ett arbetsklimat som odlar kreativitet, nyfikenhet och stort eget ansvar, med lika villkor för kvinnor, män och ickebinära. Bahnhof arbetar aktivt mot korruption och mygel i alla dess former. Transparenspolicy Bahnhof kommunicerar hur bredbandsmarknaden fungerar, hur vi, våra partners och underleverantörer samarbetar, samt hur prismodellerna ser ut inom vår bransch. Genom denna öppenhet vill vi bygga förtroende och säkerställa att våra kunder och samarbetspartners har full insyn i våra affärsmetoder, samt bidra till en hållbar bransch. Företagsmarknad Bahnhofs företagsaffär omsatte under det andra kvartalet (april–juni) 165,5 Mkr (158,7 Mkr), motsvarande en tillväxt på 4 procent jämfört med samma period 2024. Tjänsterna omfattar både nätaccess (bredband) till kontor, fastigheter och kommersiella lokaler – samt driftmiljöer i datacenter, där andelen avancerade molntjänster fortsätter att öka. Efterfrågan växer inom segmenten: DDoS-skydd och avancerade brandväggstjänster Säker datalagring i svenska anläggningar Hög tillgänglighet och geografisk redundans Kontors- och företagsnät med trådlös access Vi bygger alla våra lösningar med högsta krav på driftsäkerhet, fysisk säkerhet och långsiktig uthållighet – med tekniska specifikationer som ska klara även det yttersta stresstestet: krig. Som exempel har vi i centrala Malmö uppgraderat anläggningen ""Sparven"", tidigare Televerkets kommunikationsnav i Sydsverige under det kalla kriget. Den fungerar idag som en av regionens mest robusta noder för serverdrift, co-location och nättjänster. Bahnhofs kommande flaggskepp – Bunkerberget i Göteborg – är ett underjordiskt datacenter på 6 000 kvadratmeter som byggs för att uppnå minst Tier III-nivå i tillgänglighet, med full redundans (N+1) i kraft- och nätinfrastruktur. Anläggningen utrustas samtidigt med skydd mot tryckvågor, elektromagnetisk puls (EMP) och fysisk intrångssäkerhet enligt modern militär standard. Kombinationen gör Bunkerberget till ett av Europas mest robusta skyddsrum för digital kommunikation och samhällskritisk IT-infrastruktur. Samtliga våra datacenter – inklusive de tre stora anläggningarna i Stockholms innerstad – har dessutom uppgraderats med nya kylmaskiner för energieffektiv drift och värmeåtervinning. Privatmarknad Den organiska tillväxten på privatsidan i Sverige fortsätter. Den 30 juni 2025 hade 489 859 hushåll någon av Bahnhofs snabba fibertjänster. Under andra kvartalet (april–juni) växte vi med 1 297 nya kunder netto. Tillväxten drivs främst av bostadsrätter och villor. I öppna nät har höjda avgifter från nätägare – både privata och kommunala – i flera fall lett till att kollektiva lösningar i bostadsrättsföreningar blivit ett mer attraktivt alternativ. Bahnhof har under andra kvartalet haft en högre kundtillväxt i Sverige än samtliga av de största konkurrenterna: Telia, Tele2 och Telenor. Det visar respektive bolags egna rapporterade siffror för fasta nättjänster. Tekniskt ligger vi i framkant. I BRF:er är 2,5 Gbit/s numera standard, med möjlighet till uppgradering till 10 Gbit/s för enskilda hushåll. Trådlösa nät byggs som standard med ny WiFi 7 utrustning till alla hushåll. Samma höga prestanda gäller för Bahnhof Villafiber, som idag används av tiotusentals villaägare. Kombinationen av kapacitet, pris och tydlig integritet ger ett starkt erbjudande på en marknad där teknisk kvalitet annars ofta prioriteras bort. I kontrast till detta är bredband i många allmännyttiga hyreslägenheter fortfarande onödigt dyrt. Fastighetsbolagens egna påslag (ett exempel är fastighetsbolaget Stångåstaden i Linköping) döljs ofta i hyran och saknar koppling till den faktiska kostnaden för tjänsten. Bahnhof är en utmanare till den ordningen – med öppna villkor, modern teknik och rimliga priser för slutkunden! Tydlig kommunikation ledde BRF Jupiter till Bahnhof Bostadsrättsföreningen Jupiter är belägen i centrala Göteborg och präglas av ett tydligt fokus på delaktighet, transparens och långsiktighet. Medlemmar ska inte bara bo bra, de ska också kunna vara med och påverka föreningens utveckling. När det var dags att uppgradera föreningens bredbandslösning handlade det därför om mer än bara teknik. Det gällde att hitta en leverantör som kunde erbjuda en pålitlig helhetslösning, och som förstod vikten av tydlig kommunikation och engagemang. BRF Jupiter, som består av 46 lägenheter och bildades i samband med att fastigheten uppfördes 2008, har alltid varit noggrann i valet av leverantörer. Tidigare erfarenheter av driftproblem och otillräcklig kundtjänst gjorde att föreningen den här gången ställde särskilt höga krav i processen. ”Den överlägset bästa lösningen” Bahnhof visade snabbt att de kunde möta föreningens krav. Med ett erbjudande om skräddarsydda helhetslösningar anpassade för just bostadsrättsföreningar, och en transparent dialog från första kontakt, blev det snart tydligt att föreningen valt rätt. – Vi hade upplevt driftproblem och långa ledtider hos vår tidigare operatör. Bahnhof erbjöd den överlägset bästa lösningen för föreningen, med en smidig installation och bra kommunikation genom hela processen, säger Martin Blixt, föreningens ordförande. Professionellt, snabbt och välfungerande Installationen genomfördes utan anmärkningar, och upplevelsen har sedan dess varit mycket positiv. Framför allt lyfter föreningen fram det professionella bemötandet, den snabba återkopplingen och – inte minst – att tjänsten fungerar så bra. BRF Jupiter är mycket tydliga i sin rekommendation: – Vi skulle rekommendera alla bostadsrättsföreningar att välja Bahnhof! Letar din bostadsrättsförening också efter en pålitlig bredbandslösning? Kontakta Bahnhof och upptäck hur vi kan ge er framtidens internetuppkoppling redan idag ! Bahnhof Nordeuropa Bahnhof expanderar med full fart i Norden! Vi förbereder nu också säljstart i Tyskland den 17 september. Utlandsaffären är en strategisk satsning med syfte att bygga tillväxt i flera länder parallellt. Även om tekniska och affärsmässiga förutsättningar varierar, erbjuder vi konkurrenskraftiga tjänster för både privatpersoner och företag – på alla marknader. Norge: Här har vi vår starkaste position hittills. I slutet av juni förvärvade vi även streamingbolaget Allentes norska 5G-kundbas. Det är ett viktigt steg för att stärka närvaron och öka marknadsandelen. Norge blir därmed en pilotmarknad för bredare expansion, även med 5G som bärare av bredband. Finland: Tillväxten sker i både öppna nät och genom kollektiva uppkopplingar för BRF:er. Vi har etablerat säljkontor i Helsingfors och under hösten öppnar vi egen lokal kundtjänst i Finland. Det ger möjlighet att skala upp affären med lokal närvaro och bättre kundupplevelse. Danmark: Vi har anslutit oss till flera nya nät, vilket innebär att vi inom kort kan nå en stor del av den danska bredbandsmarknaden. Vår modell – med låg overhead och hög teknisk prestanda – gör det möjligt att ta marknadsandelar snabbt och kostnadseffektivt. Tyskland: Här är uppsidan störst! Trots att det är Europas största ekonomi är bredbandsmarknaden kraftigt eftersatt. Det skapar utrymme för disruptiva aktörer som Bahnhof. Vi har nu personal och kontor i Düsseldorf, samt teknisk närvaro i bland annat Berlin och Frankfurt. Vårt tyska dotterbolag, Bahnhof Nätverk GmbH, lanserar sina tjänster med säljstart i Berlin den 17 september. Omsättning Norden (exklusive Bahnhof Sverige) delåret 2025: Norge: 16,2 Mkr Finland: 7,6 Mkr Danmark: 0,86 Mkr Tyskland: 0,0 Mkr (säljstart under Q3) VD har ordet I mitten av juni samlades världseliten med statschefer, näringslivstoppar, högprofilerade tänkare, militärer och politiker för hemliga möten i centrala Stockholm. Konferensen pågick i flera dagar, med rigorös säkerhet och förtroliga samtal bakom hotellets fördragna gardiner. För ovanlighetens skull rapporterade media om händelsen i förväg. Konferensen med ämnen som till exempel AI, ukrainakriget och migration avslutades med en exklusiv middag i Wallenbergs grosshandlarvilla på Djurgården. Det var den mytomspunna ”Bilderberggruppen” som samlats för att avhandla aktuella världsfrågor. Vad som sades i själva samtalen är inte känt, annat än av de som var med förstås. Bahnhof stod tekniskt för bredbandsnätet och skyddet av datatrafiken för deltagarna. Vi skräddarsyr ju lösningar där kunder efterfrågar en kombination av blixtsnabbt bredband och datasäkerhet för hemlig kommunikation. Internet med sekretess är såklart en tjänst som finns för alla våra kunder. Den är inte bara förbehållen en liten exklusiv elit. Bortom det affärsmässiga borde det vara en mänsklig rättighet; att få ha en egen privat kommunikation. Ett fundament för en fri åsiktsbildning är att också kunna föra ett samtal utan att vara avlyssnad. Den rätten bör inte förbehållas bara ett litet fåtal höga beslutsfattare. De makthavare som ropar högst om mer avlyssning och storskalig övervakning, är ofta samma grupp som är mindre transparent med sina egna hemligheter. Det skapar en asymmetri som kan underminera demokratin. Delåret 2025 - Bahnhof stärker greppet om Norden! Vi är nu inne i en starkt positiv trend med ekonomisk tillväxt. Omsättningen ökar med 9,3 procent till 1 085,0 Mkr (992,3 Mkr). Nettomarginalen för delåret uppgick till 13,4 %. Det visar på fortsatt sund tillväxt med stark lönsamhet, trots ökade initiala kostnader i samband med utlandssatsningen. I halvtid har vi ett bra slagläge för att överträffa angivna prognosmål för helåret 2025. Vi har lyckats att etablera oss i alla våra nordiska grannländer, och nu växer affären i land efter land. Vi förbereder dessutom säljstart i Tyskland den 17 september. Marknaderna har olika affärsmässiga och tekniska villkor, men just det passar ett bolag som Bahnhof. Vi äger inte all infrastruktur själva, men vi levererar den bästa IP-kommunikationen till de bästa villkoren. Särskilt väl utvecklar sig affären i Norge och Finland. I slutet av juni förvärvar vi streamingbolaget Allentes 5G-kundbas i Norge. I Danmark räknar vi med att ett par nytillkommande nät ska ge ökad kundtillströmning under kommande kvartal. Vi har dessutom tagit ett antal bostadsrättsföreningar i Köpenhamn. I Sverige växer vi med 1 297 nya privatkunder netto. Om man jämför med de största konkurrenterna Telia, Tele2 och Telenor har Bahnhof Sverige en högre kundtillväxt än dem under det andra kvartalet (källa: bolagens egen publika rapportering avseende fasta nättjänster i Q2 år 2025). Den långsiktiga trenden är en stark organisk tillväxt i segmentet för villor och bostadsrättsföreningar. Våra tjänster kostar en bråkdel av vad slutkunder betalar för internet i allmännyttans hyreslägenheter. Det senare är en effekt av fastighetsbolagens påslag, som i praktiken är en dold hyra (och alltså inte en avgift bara för bredbandet). På företagssidan förbättrar vi tillväxten under det andra kvartalet. Det oförutsägbara omvärldsläget stärker oss som operatör. Bahnhof levererar bredband och oberoende molntjänster i datacenter som drivs med ett nordiskt perspektiv. Europa och oberoende IT-tjänster med datasäkerhet! Bahnhof erbjuder IT-tjänster och molnlösningar bortom strafftullar och amerikansk nykolonialism. Vårt synsätt kan syresätta Europas bredbandsmarknad – inte minst i Tyskland. Vi står för europeisk fighting spirit och mindre av digital defaitism! Det handlar om tekniskt oberoende, men också om politisk frihet. Bahnhofs bredband och molntjänster står på egna ben. Det är samma filosofi som får flera länder att välja bort det amerikanska stridsflyget F‑35 – för att slippa ett beroende som kan svänga med vad en nyckfull Donald Trump ätit till frukost. Vi lever i en orolig tid på flera sätt. Det vidriga ryska anfallskriget har slungat Europa tillbaka till en mörkare epok. Vill det sig riktigt illa befinner vi oss nu i ett slags förkrigsläge. Det krävs både digital och fysisk beredskap. Därför förbereder vi nu en strategisk satsning på att bygga ett datacenter i Bunkerberget – ett 6 000 kvadratmeter stort bergrum i närheten av centrala Göteborg. Anläggningen byggdes ursprungligen av Svenska Kullagerfabriken under det kalla kriget, med syftet att skydda verksamheten mot ett sovjetiskt angrepp. Från och med den 1 september övergår bergrummet i Bahnhofs ägo. Vi bygger nu om det med modern militär standard som riktmärke: skydd mot tryckvågor, skydd mot elektromagnetiska pulser (EMP), och redundans i både kraft- och nätförsörjning. Syftet är att skapa en säker hamn för samhällskritisk IT-infrastruktur – ett fysiskt skyddsrum för IT-tjänster och kommunikation. Låt oss kalla det för en digital port mot Europa. För den som är en inbiten umarell* kommer vissa av de publika delarna av bygget gå att följa på bunkerberget.se (* Begreppet kommer ursprungligen från Italien, och betyder ungefär ""liten farbror"". Det är en äldre herre, gärna med händerna på ryggen, som med stort intresse betraktar och kommenterar byggarbetsplatser utan att själv delta). Språkmodellerna tar över världen – nu svarar de på mejl! I början av 2023 skrev jag om LLM-revolutionen och Karel Capeks pjäs R.U.R. från år 1922. Det var ju han som myntade ordet ”robot” i dess moderna mening; en tänkande och självständig maskin. Rossums Universal Robots är alla dystopiers urmoder. Maskinerna tar makten och utplånar mänskligheten. Jag tror ändå den gode Karel och senare science fiction, ända bort till Terminator, underskattade faran. Dystopin är i verkligheten mycket värre! En kamrat till mig som bland annat jobbar med AI delade detta: ”Man kan nu med agent-mode låta AI svara på email och fortsätta med analyser och långa svar helt automatiskt i all oändlighet. Jag gjorde det med en säljare häromdagen som avbröt efter 7 - 8 mailvändor. Jag gjorde ingenting, min agent skötte snacket perfekt. Hade instruerat att verka intresserad och ställa frågor om varje funktion, men bara en fråga per email och hela tiden fråga om priser. Han nappade på betet och lade en massa tid på att svara :-). Det var elakt. Men nu ska ju den nya tekniken testas - och då får säljarna hitta sin strategi för att nå fram.” Det här var ett anekdotiskt exempel. Men här anar jag en dystopisk baksmälla med den nya tekniken. Det blir allt svårare att avgöra vad som är äkta människor. Vi drunknar i kommunikation som låter personlig, men som är maskintillverkad. Vi kvävs av personliga röster, politiska budskap, privata säljmejl och jobbansökningar, skräddarsydd reklam, enkäter och nyheter – men avsändaren är en burk. Och den låter precis som din vän, din kollega eller någon du måste vara mänskligt trevlig – eller otrevlig – mot. Vi är i början av LLM-revolutionen. I positiv mening får jag samma känsla som under slutet av 1990-talet när internet bröt igenom på allvar, och ännu var ett oskrivet blad av upptäckarglädje och vildvuxen innovation. Anden kan inte längre stoppas tillbaka i flaskan. Det är på sitt sätt väldigt kul! Vi lever i en skön ny värld där ingen snart vet vem som är en robot. Jag är teknikentusiast. Men kanske kommer ett slags positiv revansch för humanismen. De kreativa mänskliga promptarna blir viktigare än bara kodandet. Ord blir det nya programspråket. Vem vet, nästa Bilderbergmöte kanske hålls mellan maskiner helt utan mänsklig inblandning. Om det nu redan inte är så förstås. Och om det ens är jag själv som skrivit denna text… -Jo, det är det. Jag lovar! LOVAR! Stockholm, den 15 augusti 2025 Jon Karlung, VD Bahnhof AB Finansiell situation Närmare upplysningar om underliggande finansiella faktorer återfinns i denna rapport. Analyser för koncernen inkluderar även moderbolaget, såvida vi inte uttryckligen anger att det endast gäller moderbolaget. Eftersom moderbolaget är en så betydande del av koncernen är förklaringarna för koncernen också relevanta för moderbolaget. Utveckling av resultat och ställning Intäkterna för det första halvåret 2025 uppgick till 1 085,0 Mkr (992,3 Mkr). Bahnhofs intäkter består nästan enbart av abonnemangsintäkter från både företags- och privatkunder. Omsättningen påverkas inte av säsongsmässiga variationer. Rörelseresultatet (EBIT) uppgick till 140,6 Mkr (130,9 Mkr). Rörliga ersättningar till nätägare fortsätter öka – detta i kombination med utlandssatsningar och stora kampanjer i Sverige som sätter press på nettomarginalen i det korta perspektivet. Trots det förbättrar Bahnhof resultatet jämfört med samma period föregående år. Kassaflöde och finansiell situation Kassaflödet för det första halvåret 2025 är -63,5 Mkr (-197,2 Mkr). Den sista juni är likvida medel i Bahnhof 604,0 Mkr (560,6 Mkr). Leasingskulderna uppgår till 133,5 Mkr (131,2 Mkr). Kassaflödet från verksamheten är i grunden mycket starkt och perioden belastas av en aktieutdelning på 215,1 Mkr. Leasingskulden är en effekt av att Bahnhof tillämpar IFRS som redovisningsprincip. Det innebär att till exempel alla framtida hyreskostnader (för åratal framåt i tiden) bokas upp som en skuld i förväg. Skulden är alltså ingen traditionell skuld, annat än rent bokföringsmässigt. Bahnhof har under perioden investerat totalt 34,2 Mkr (46,7 Mkr). Investeringarna avser löpande uppgraderingar av Bahnhofs nät och teknikplattformar på olika orter i Sverige, ett nytt ekonomisystem samt renovering av kontorslokaler. Under årets första halvår förvärvades även majoritetsägande i den norska internetoperatören Brdy AS. Bahnhofkoncernen har idag en stark kassa som kommer att användas till investeringar i olika framtidsprojekt eller förvärv. Bolagsstruktur Moderbolag i Bahnhofkoncernen är Bahnhof AB (publ) med organisationsnummer 556519-9493 och säte i Stockholm. Bahnhof AB (publ) har ett svenskt dotterbolag, Elementica Data Center Construction AB (556715-9495) samt ett svenskt dotterbolag Bahnhof LABS AB (559347-4967). Bahnhof har dessutom ett portugisiskt dotterbolag Bahnhof Unipessoal LDA (PT 509519636), ett norskt dotterbolag Bahnhof Norge AS (986 108 351), ett danskt dotterbolag Bahnhof Elementica ApS (44155745), ett finskt dotterbolag Bahnhof Oy (3392491- 2). Utöver de helägda dotterbolagen äger Bahnhof AB 76% av det norska bolaget Brdy Holding AS (933 839 842) samt 90 procent av det tyska bolaget Bahnhof Nätverk GmbH (HRB 259489). Väsentliga risker och osäkerheter Bahnhof verkar på en marknad med många konkurrenter, olika tekniska lösningar och i en föränderlig omvärld. Bolaget och dess kunder kan bli utsatta för allvarliga dataintrång, myndigheters godtycke, politiska beslut som ändrar spelregler och ökar kostnader samt teknikskiften som dramatiskt ändrar förutsättningar för bolagets tjänster. Bahnhof har motståndskraft mot flera av dessa risker genom att vår kärnverksamhet är datasäkerhet. Vi har också en stor och bred kundbas med olika tjänster. Bahnhof är inte beroende av enstaka kunder, affärsområden eller tjänster. I ett sämre konjunkturläge säljer vi tjänster som få kan vara utan. I avtalen med våra kunder har vi klausuler som reglerar en ökad inflation och prisökningar från våra underleverantörer. I årsredovisningen för 2024 beskrivs väsentliga risker och osäkerheter utförligt. Riskbedömningen är oförändrad jämfört med årsredovisningen. Ingen förändring har skett jämfört med årsredovisning. Transaktioner med närstående De två huvudägarna är Jon Karlung och Andreas Norman som tillsammans äger drygt 50 procent av kapitalet i Bahnhof genom bolaget K.N. Telecom. Bahnhof har ett konsultavtal med K.N. Telecom och hyr en kontorsbyggnad av K.N. Telecom. Kontorsbyggnaden ligger i en fastighet i centrala Borlänge som är dimensionerad för ca 80 medarbetare (främst kundtjänst). Hyran är satt på marknadsmässiga villkor och Bahnhof betalar enligt avtal för närvarande 112 450 kronor per månad till K.N. Telecom AB. First North Bahnhof är noterat på Nasdaq First North Growth Market. Certified adviser är FNCA Sweden AB. Granskning Denna delårsrapport har inte varit föremål för granskning av företagets revisorer.

The M&A market has also heated up during the summer with some large investments and acquisitions that prove to us and customers that the Teneo hybrid ML, LLM is the right AI solution for Voice. Market Overview The mindshare of OpenAI has been deafening in the last few years. Sam Altman’s predictions gain more headlines than wars. This has led to all our customers experimenting with companies that provide wrappers on top of LLM´s. This is different than our approach – we use proprietary technology in Teneo to understand what customers are calling about. This technology is based on traditional Machine Learning as well as Small Language Models and in the development of the customer solution Large Language Models are used. Newly minted companies that have seen a lot of investments and gained attention such as Sierra.ai use only Large Language Models. In July we saw an acquisition that validates our approach. Cognigy, was acquired in July by NiCE (number two in Contact Center Software) at a valuation of 26 times sales including Professional Services. Total purchase price of 955 MUSD. Their technology is a platform using deterministic models just like ours. NiCE could of course have acquired any of the LLM wrapper companies at a much lower price but chose to acquire a comprehensive platform. This proves that to really have impact in the Contact Center you need to use deterministic technologies rather than only Large Language Models. Customers are slowly arriving at the same conclusion. We are currently engaged in three proofs of concepts where we see great increases in accuracy with our approach. The pure LLM players are currently increasing the sales cycle but luckily LLM´s are also more expensive to use in production so this does not increase price pressure. When considering Enterprise features such as security, accuracy, and performance Teneo remains uniquely positioned in the market, effectively managing high-volume telephony operations and automating up to 91% of incoming calls (more on this new number below), offering unmatched efficiency and reliability. Teneo.ai has a large proportion of our business with US customers. The company maintains a stable outlook, with no immediate risks aside from currency exchange rates identified from current U.S. administrative actions or proposed economic measures, including toll tariffs. Sales Cycles have increased as many customers are restrictive with investments in an uncertain environment. The positive side of the current development for Teneo is an increased focus on cost reductions which increases the interest in adding AI Agents into the workforce. Pipeline Development Sales and Marketing in the second quarter 2025 prioritized qualifying the opportunities created in the first quarter 2025 and putting focus on the closeable opportunities. We also broadened our geographical focus to include Turkey where we see interest in our solutions. Partnerships Two important additional partnerships were signed during the second quarter 2025. EBO.ai, a company focused on automation that delivers to the same National Healthcare unit that CGI and we renewed the agreement just after the second quarter 2025. Together we are building a role model hospital contact center built on Teneo in the Middle East that we also will be showcasing to UK and US prospects. By combining EBO´s healthcare trained AI models with Teneo we will be able to increase patient access and satisfaction while freeing up valuable care resources. We also welcome FGS as a partner. FGS is part of the Vodafone group and has a very strong presence in Turkish Enterprises. Their local knowledge combined with a strong Turkish enterprise interest in using AI to automate Customer Care make this ideal for Teneo collaboration and we already have several joint opportunities we are addressing. Analysts In the Contact Center space there is an analyst that is trusted by more enterprises than any other. That is DMG Consulting. In the DMG Consulting's 2025 enterprise report where we participated for the first time, Teneo.ai earned perfect customer satisfaction scores across seven key areas, including implementation, pricing, and overall vendor satisfaction. This achievement is particularly significant because it's based on feedback from actual enterprise customers, validating Teneo's voice-first agentic AI platform for contact center automation. The perfect scores underscore the Teneo´s ability to deliver value through high accuracy rates and substantial operational cost savings. For Teneo, this recognition solidifies our position as a trusted and leading partner in a competitive market, where customer satisfaction is a critical differentiator. Customer Feedback Our Teneo is the only tool that has the accuracy and performance to actually replace people answering the phone. In the second quarter 2025, we got this confirmed by one of our very large customers. This customer has 10 million inbound calls per month. In order to serve these customers correctly the most important component is understanding why they are calling. This is called Natural Language Understanding. This is the step that entails both the accuracy in transcribing speech to text and then parsing understanding from this text. In this customer the understanding was 99% - which is much better than any other solution. But even more importantly 91% of all calls were manged by Teneo instead of a human leading to higher customer satisfaction. That is 9.1 million automated calls per month. Astonishing ROI! Strategic Sales Events During second quarter 2025, we have focused on developing the opportunities that we created in the first quarter 2025. We have moved six to qualified, three into proposal sent and we have three in the stage Pilot/POC. This means that we are progressing our opportunities and focusing the work on closing. The pipeline almost doubled to 2 MEUR in weighted numbers primarily due to the progression of our opportunities. Our new sales pipeline is measured as a 12-month subscription value, excluding future API calls—though API calls make up most of our revenue. The pipeline is weighted based on the sales stage of each opportunity and does not include additional revenue from existing customers. For example, consider a sales opportunity for a new customer similar to one of our large existing clients. If this opportunity is in the *qualified* sales stage, it would be valued at: 9,900 times 12 months times 20% (weight for qualified stage) = approximately 24,000 EUR. While the long-term potential revenue from such a customer could be 3.5 MEUR per year, our pipeline reflects only 24,000 EUR at this stage. Since our first quarter 2025 report, our weighted pipeline has again almost doubled to 2 045 000 EUR from 1 050 000 EUR in our first quarter 2025 report. Our pipeline progression this quarter is mostly driven by our opportunities moving up in sales stages thereby increasing the probability of closing. We have fewer opportunities in total as we have qualified out some of the created opportunities in the first quarter 2025. The remaining pipeline includes major enterprises across various sectors, driven by factors such as the discontinuation of Nuance (the foundation for traditional keypad navigation systems) and our partnership with Genesys and the associated eco system. Our first opportunity where AWS has engaged together with our partner Cloudhesive is also a promising development opening up more avenues for pipeline development. Preparation for Teneo 8 rollout During the third quarter 2025 we will be rolling out the biggest update to our Teneo ever. The details will be released at a later stage during the quarter. In preparation for this we have been pushing legacy, chat only customers to accept upgrading to the new codebase. We delivered a record gross margin of 88% in the second quarter 2025, but in order to further bring up our gross margin we want all customers to use one and the same codebase. Customers that use chat only in Teneo do not see the value in the solutions as does a voice customer and therefore those that are not able to move to voice will likely not be moving to the new codebase. In our forward looking ARR metric we have taken this into account. Those customers are costly for us to serve and the functionality we are pushing in the new release is very important for our enterprise voice prospects and customers. Last quarters change in how we operate our SaaS has brought the cost savings and associated higher Gross Margin as projected. Autumn focus Looking ahead we have the partnerships and pipeline to deliver on our goal to hit 20 MUSD ARR within the first quarter 2026. Selling to large enterprises involves many stakeholders and many hoops to go through. Once we are in the process, we see that our message resonates and when we have the chance to prove our technology we never fail. We have enough qualified opportunity to reach our goal – now its closing focus. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated team, our valued partners, and exceptional customers for their continued collaboration. And of course, to our shareholders who continue to support us on this journey! Thank you all for your continued support and confidence.

The report is unaudited. In H1 2025, ViroGates experienced reduced customer activity, reflecting its ongoing strategic shift from focusing on the acute care and research markets towards focusing on the broader health and longevity market. Revenue reached DKK 1.9 million (H1 2024: DKK 2.3 million). The revenue loss is attributed to the transition to cater to a new customer segment, necessarily entailing a period of adjustment. The operating loss decreased to DKK 5.9 million (H1 2024: DKK 7.9 million), primarily due to contributions from the partnership with Sobi on an FDA clearance in the US for suPARnostic® TurbiLatex. Other major activities and developments included an expansion of the partnership agreement with Sobi, extending the scope of the existing agreement beyond the US. ViroGates also participated in the Aesthetic & Anti-Ageing Medicine World Congress in Monaco, positioning suPARnostic® as a tool for monitoring biological aging and chronic inflammation. Lastly, ViroGates announced a new proof-of-concept version of the suPARnostic® POC+ device, targeting decentralised longevity testing. Despite a complex commercial and regulatory landscape, ViroGates remains committed to balancing support for existing customers with building capabilities in general health and longevity, laying the groundwork for the Company’s future growth. ViroGates increased the number of recurring customers (defined as customers placing at least two orders with an accumulated value above 10,000 EUR in the past 12 months) from 17 by the end of H1 2024 to 19 by the end of H1 2025. This development is positive, as it reflects a broader base of repeat customers, lowering the dependency on singular, large accounts. Laboratories and health clinics remain smaller accounts, but represent the ability to grow significantly in value as suPARnostic® becomes a more established biomarker in the population health and longevity field. ViroGates restates its guidance and expects full-year revenue between DKK 5 to 7 million and an EBIT of DKK -8 to -11 million in 2025. Jakob Knudsen, CEO of ViroGates, says: “The first half of 2025 was characterised by low customer activity, reflecting the ongoing transitional phase for ViroGates. While commercial traction remains a work in progress, we have taken notable steps in our key partnership with Sobi, contributing to our other income, product innovation for our POC+ product, and expanding the relevance of suPARnostic® in the longevity and health market. We look particularly forward to getting traction in the US during H2 of 2025, as this is currently the most advanced market for health testing using biomarkers.” Financial results in H1 2025 Revenue decreased by 18% to TDKK 1,869 (TDKK 2,276) Operating expenses amounted to TDKK -9,485 (TDKK -9,586) Operating loss decreased by 26% to TDKK -5,871 (TDKK -7,926) Net loss decreased by 22% to TDKK -6,031 (TDKK -7,690) Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period amounted to 11,804 (TDKK 8,736) Business highlights in H1 2025 ViroGates and Sobi amended their existing agreement, confirming Sobi's commitment to fund and contribute with regulatory competencies to bring suPARnostic® TurbiLatex to market in the US and comply with regulations in the EU, cf.

Significant events after the end of the reporting period Cabonline defers certain interest payments for July in accordance with the terms and conditions of its sustainability-linked notes. Flygtaxi – part of Cabonline – selected as preferred partner in SAS Transfer. Cabonline to continue delivering trusted service trips in Örebro. CEO's comment Significant price pressure in public procurement During the second quarter, competition in public procurement increased. In line with our strategy, we continue to prioritise quality and long-term sustainability. We implemented our new communication platform, Hello, in the regions South, Stockholm and West to strengthen dialogue with drivers and transporters. Our new booking and dispatch system, iCabbi, was fine-tuned and we launched updated applications for drivers and passengers. Over time, the project is expected to deliver significant efficiency gains and an improved customer experience. During the quarter, we also continued to streamline operations. These measures are expected to result in lower personnel costs and reduced external expenses, including consultancy costs, in the latter part of 2025 with further effects expected in 2026. At Almedalen, we highlighted ways to improve the procurement of care-related travel – with a focus on quality, sustainability and secure working conditions. We emphasised that experience, accountability and delivery capacity should carry greater weight than price alone. Results in brief In the second quarter, Cabonline’s revenue amounted to SEK 1,118 million compared with SEK 1,225 million in the same period last year, an organic decrease of 8%. Adjusted EBITDA totalled SEK 54 million, a decrease of 4% compared to last year. The EBITDA margin reached 4.8%, compared to 4.6% last year. Performance by business segment In the public segment (B2P), we signed an agreement to continue operating school transport in Sigtuna during the appeal period. It is also gratifying that customer satisfaction with drivers reached a new record high in ANBARO, the national survey of perceived quality in elderly and patient service trips. Flygtaxi became Preferred Partner to SAS through a new Nordic agreement, further strengthening our offering in the air travel segment. Combined with the partnership with Finnair, launched in the second quarter, we now have a strong presence with the leading airlines in the Nordic region. The segment is still characterised by a high market share and stable margins. The number of trips declined by 3%, in line with the development in domestic travel. Business travel (B2B) volumes decreased year-on-year overall, reflecting continued market oversupply and price pressure. However, Sweden’s West region and Norway’s West and North regions delivered strong growth. Private travel (B2C) volumes also decreased year-on-year overall. However, we recorded growth in Norway as well as a positive effect in Helsinki following the implementation of the agreement with the central station. Several well-received collaborations were carried out, including Elitloppet at Solvalla, the National Day celebrations at the Royal Palace, and the Summer Club in Malmö. To stimulate demand and strengthen the brand, summer campaigns were launched at eleven strategically selected airports and central stations across the Nordic region. Sustainability and responsibility The targets linked to our sustainability-linked bonds were exceeded by a wide margin: 72% of passenger cars were powered by electricity or biogas, compared with the 2025 target of 50%. The share of electric vehicles reached 46% of the total fleet.

CEO's comment Significant price pressure in public procurement During the second quarter, competition in public procurement increased. In line with our strategy, we continue to prioritise quality and long-term sustainability. We implemented our new communication platform, Hello, in the regions South, Stockholm and West to strengthen dialogue with drivers and transporters. Our new booking and dispatch system, iCabbi, was fine-tuned and we launched updated applications for drivers and passengers. Over time, the project is expected to deliver significant efficiency gains and an improved customer experience. During the quarter, we also continued to streamline operations. These measures are expected to result in lower personnel costs and reduced external expenses, including consultancy costs, in the latter part of 2025 with further effects expected in 2026. At Almedalen, we highlighted ways to improve the procurement of care-related travel – with a focus on quality, sustainability and secure working conditions. We emphasised that experience, accountability and delivery capacity should carry greater weight than price alone. Results in brief In the second quarter, Cabonline’s revenue amounted to SEK 1,118 million compared with SEK 1,225 million in the same period last year, an organic decrease of 8%. Adjusted EBITDA totalled SEK 54 million, a decrease of 4% compared to last year. The EBITDA margin reached 4.8%, compared to 4.6% last year. Performance by business segment In the public segment (B2P), we signed an agreement to continue operating school transport in Sigtuna during the appeal period. It is also gratifying that customer satisfaction with drivers reached a new record high in ANBARO, the national survey of perceived quality in elderly and patient service trips. Flygtaxi became Preferred Partner to SAS through a new Nordic agreement, further strengthening our offering in the air travel segment. Combined with the partnership with Finnair, launched in the second quarter, we now have a strong presence with the leading airlines in the Nordic region. The segment is still characterised by a high market share and stable margins. The number of trips declined by 3%, in line with the development in domestic travel. Business travel (B2B) volumes decreased year-on-year overall, reflecting continued market oversupply and price pressure. However, Sweden’s West region and Norway’s West and North regions delivered strong growth. Private travel (B2C) volumes also decreased year-on-year overall. However, we recorded growth in Norway as well as a positive effect in Helsinki following the implementation of the agreement with the central station. Several well-received collaborations were carried out, including Elitloppet at Solvalla, the National Day celebrations at the Royal Palace, and the Summer Club in Malmö. To stimulate demand and strengthen the brand, summer campaigns were launched at eleven strategically selected airports and central stations across the Nordic region. Sustainability and responsibility The targets linked to our sustainability-linked bonds were exceeded by a wide margin: 72% of passenger cars were powered by electricity or biogas, compared with the 2025 target of 50%. The share of electric vehicles reached 46% of the total fleet. Looking ahead We are confident in our ability to deliver further efficiencies as we continue our platform upgrades and streamlining our operations. In the next quarter, we will implement iCabbi in the regions North, Halmstad and Jönköping. In parallel, Hello will also be rolled out in the regions North and Central. Efficiency across all our operations remains a priority, while we intensify our efforts to increase travel through our commercial initiatives. Our transformation journey has been marked by several significant advances. I look to the future with confidence and wish to express my gratitude to our employees, drivers and operators for your commitment, as well as to our customers and investors for your continued trust.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Adjusted key figures are used to improve comparability between reporting periods. The adjusted key figures are adjusted for the impacts of corporate transactions influencing comparability, as well as certain material non-operating items. More information on the calculation of the key figures is available in the tables section of the Half-Year Financial Report. Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Schedule for dividend payment In accordance with the decision of the Annual General Meeting of United Bankers Plc on 21 March 2025, the company will pay the second instalment of the dividend in the autumn as part of the dividend distribution for the financial year 2024.

In addition, Lehto has 12 electricity storage projects in development, with a combined capacity of approximately 55 MW.

Lehto is also in negotiations on leasing and installment financing for batteries. Events related to the restructuring program During the first half of the year, Lehto reduced its secured, unsecured, conditional and maximum liabilities defined in the restructuring program by a total of EUR 0.3 million. At the end of the second half of the year, approximately EUR 1.8 million of liabilities under the restructuring program must be reduced. Lehto Group Oyj and its subsidiary Lehto Components sold their assets during the review period for approximately EUR 0.3 million. The proceeds from the sales were mainly used to pay off restructuring liabilities. Events related to the shares On 31 January 2025, the 75,000,000 new shares issued in the conversion of Lehto's convertible bond were registered in the Trade Register.

Contrary to previous information, Lehto estimates that the transfer of the trading venue for the shares will not take place by the end of 2025, but only in the first half of 2026, when trading in the shares would also begin. Admission of shares to trading on the First North Growth Market requires the preparation of a prospectus and approval by Nasdaq Helsinki. Currently, trading in the shares is suspended. Financial development during the review period The Group's net sales from continuing operations, EUR 0.4 million, were at the level of the comparison period and consisted mainly of rental income from properties owned by the Group, electricity market incomes and income from the sale of inventories. The operating result from continuing operations was EUR -1.5 million (EUR -4.7 million in 1H24). The operating result was affected by low net sales, factory maintenance costs and costs related to the start-up of the energy construction business.

In this report, discontinued operations include Lehto Group Plc’s subsidiaries that went bankrupt and the Swedish operations. The Group's cash and cash equivalents decreased to EUR 0.8 million (EUR 2.2 million on 31 December 2024). The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was mainly due to the loss-making result and investments in electricity storage projects. The Group's personnel decreased during the review period. At the end of June, the Group had 57 (76 on 31 December 2024) employees, of whom 50 (67 on 31 December 2024) were on full-time or part-time layoffs. The laid-off employees are employees of Lehto Components Oy. Energy construction business during the review period During the review period, Lehto's focus was on developing electricity storage projects and coordinating the technical requirements and commercial solutions for electricity storage. Among other things, Lehto signed several land lease agreements for electricity storage locations, prepared technical plans related to the sites, negotiated with electricity grid companies on connecting electricity storage to electricity grids, and obtained permits related to the construction of electricity storage. During the review period, Lehto started the construction of five new electricity storage projects with a total capacity of approximately 2.2 MW. At the end of the review period, the projects in question were still under construction. The commissioning of the electricity storage projects requires passing tests and approval from the transmission grid company Fingrid. The construction permit processes for electricity storage projects and the permit processes of electricity grid companies have required more time than expected. At the end of the review period, Lehto had 12 electricity storage projects in the development phase, with a combined capacity of approximately 55 MW. The company estimates that some of the projects under development will be ready for production by the end of 2025. The projects have been financed with cash and project-specific loans from external investors. Loans from investors amounted to approximately EUR 0.5 million during the review period. Lehto is also in negotiations for leasing and installment financing of batteries. Balance sheet and financial position Consolidated balance sheet, EUR million 30 Jun 2025 30 Jun 2024 31 Dec 2024 Non-current assets 6.9 7.8 6.4 Current assets Inventories, excluding IFRS 16 assets 0.6 1.3 0.7 Current receivables 0.2 0.6 0.2 Cash and cash equivalents 0.8 0.7 2.2 Non-current assets held for sale 1.9 2.4 Assets total 10.4 10.4 11.8 Equity -0.7 -18.2 1.0 Financial liabilities 4.0 15.8 3.5 Lease liabilities 0.0 0.3 0.0 Advances received 0.0 Other paybles 4.4 12.5 4.7 Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale 2.7 2.6 Equity and liabilities total 10.4 10.4 11.8 Assets Non-current assets increased by EUR 0.5 million from the year-end as a result of investments in electricity storage made to the balance sheet. At the end of the review period, non-current assets were EUR 6.9 million and they mainly consist of Lehto Components Oy's Oulainen factory building and machinery and furniture. Non-current assets also include a total of EUR 1.5 million in ownerships and shares in real estate companies and one project company, as well as parts and components of electricity storage. Inventories, EUR 0.6 million, mainly consist of materials of Lehto Components Oy and finished products owned by Lehto Group Plc. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by EUR 1.7 million, which was due to a loss and investments in electricity storage. Non-current assets held for sale consist of lease rights related to Lehto Components Oy's Hartola factory, machinery and equipment. Liabilities The amount of financial liabilities increased by EUR 0.5 million during the review period as a result of loans taken out for electricity storage investments. At the end of the review period, the amount of financial liabilities was EUR 4.0 million, of which approximately EUR 3.5 million consists of secured RCF bank debt and approximately EUR 0.5 million of loans taken out for electricity storage investments. The RCF bank debt will be repaid according to the schedule specified in the company's restructuring program. The debt is secured by, among other things, all shares and most significant receivables of real estate companies owned by Lehto Group Oyj, as well as the assets of bankrupt subsidiaries. If the assets of the bankruptcy estates of subsidiaries are used to repay Lehto Group Oyj's RCF bank debt, the bankruptcy estates in question will become creditors of Lehto Group Oyj with the rights of the original creditor. Other liabilities are mainly unsecured liabilities according to the restructuring program and in addition, ordinary trade and accrued liabilities. Liabilities related to non-current assets held for sale are the realized and future rental obligations of Lehto Components Oy's Hartola factory in accordance with IFRS 16.

During 2025, Lehto aims to build significantly more new electricity storage capacity, which will be used primarily in the reserve and wholesale markets, but also in connection with the properties’ own energy solutions. During 2026-2028, Lehto aims to build new electricity storage capacity so that the net sales generated from electricity storage in 2028 would be approximately EUR 25 million and the operating result would be more than 10% of net sales. The business requires significant battery investments, which will be acquired partly by leasing and partly by purchasing for its own balance sheet. The working capital needs of the initial phase of the business will be managed through capital investments specified in Lehto’s restructuring program. Risks and uncertainties The most important risks for 2025 are described below. Liquidity and funding risk The company is in restructuring proceedings and in accordance with the restructuring program, the company's cash expenses can be financed in the following main aspects: The company's current operating expenses will be paid with capital investments in accordance with the restructuring program and with the income flows from completed electricity storage projects. The investments required by electricity storage projects will be financed with project-specific debt instruments. Payments of restructuring liabilities will be financed by the sale of assets At the time of publication of this half-yearly report, the company does not have significant regular income flows. The company's current cash resources are not sufficient to cover the company's current expenses, investments required by electricity storage projects and payments in accordance with the restructuring program. In the last quarter of the year, the company will have to make repayments of restructuring liabilities of approximately EUR 2.2 million. Although Lehto's reserve and wholesale market yields are expected to grow during 2025, the company must succeed in selling its assets and/or obtaining new equity or debt financing to meet its payment obligations. Failure to raise capital or sell assets could result in the company being unable to meet its payment obligations. Risks related to starting and expanding the energy construction business The business is still in its early stages and its expansion requires, among other things, technical assessment and planning, building procurement channels, finding suitable energy project sites, operational implementation of projects, obtaining financing, and finding partners and building cooperation models. Failure to implement these may lead to delays in starting the business and a deterioration in liquidity. Risks related to the sale of factory operations The company is in negotiations to sell the factory operations of Lehto Components Oy. It is possible that the factory operations cannot be sold or the factory premises and equipment cannot be leased. In such a situation, the company would be left with cost burdens related to the maintenance of the factories and the company might not be able to meet its payments. Resolutions of the Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting held on 22 May 2025 decided, in accordance with the proposal of the Board of Directors, that no dividend be paid based on the approved balance sheet for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2024. The number of members of the Company's Board of Directors was decided to be three. In accordance with the proposal of the Shareholders' Nomination Board, Timo Okkonen, Tarja Teppo and Hannu Lehto were re-elected as members of the Board of Directors. Jani Nokkanen had previously notified the Company that he was no longer available as a member of the Board of Directors. The term of office of the Board of Directors members will end at the Annual General Meeting in 2025. The Annual General Meeting authorized the Board of Directors to decide on the acquisition of the Company's own shares in one or more installments with funds belonging to the Company's unrestricted equity or without consideration, so that the maximum number of shares to be acquired is 16,200,000 shares. The amount corresponds to approximately 10 percent of all shares in the Company. The Annual General Meeting authorized the Board of Directors to decide on share issues and the issuance of stock options and other special rights entitling to shares, so that the Board of Directors is authorized to decide on the issuance of a total of 16,200,000 shares through a share issue or by issuing stock options or other special rights entitling to shares. The amount corresponds to approximately 10 percent of all shares in the company. The above-mentioned and other decisions of the Annual General Meeting are reported in the stock exchange release published on 22 May 2025. Events after the review period There are no events after the end of the review period that would have a material impact on Lehto's revenue, results or financial position. 20 August 2025 Lehto Group Plc Board of Directors Further information: Hannu Lehto, CEO +358 500 280 448 Veli-Pekka Paloranta, CFO +358 400 944 074 TABLES The preparation principles and calculation formulas for the half-yearly report are mainly the same as in the company's latest financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The going concern basis has no effect on the valuation of balance sheet items, as the valuation of the Group's assets is based on an estimate of the recoverable amounts in situations where they fall below the carrying amount determined on a going concern basis.

CEO KARI TUOMALA: IMPROVING PROFITABILITY SUPPORTS STRONG GROWTH In the first half of 2025, our revenue grew strongly to EUR 24.9 (6.7) million. This growth was driven in particular by successful deliveries of modular energy storage solutions in Finland and the delivery of power quality solutions and products to international customers. The development was driven by active demand in both the energy storage business supporting renewable energy and the power quality market, which promotes energy efficiency. During the review period, we succeeded in improving the profitability of the company's operations. We improved the productization of our deliveries, which resulted in greater efficiency in the operations of our own factory. In addition, we were able to leverage the experience and expertise gained from previous deliveries. Our operating margin (EBITDA) for the first half of the year was approximately EUR 0.3 million positive, whereas in the comparison period it was approximately EUR 3.4 million negative. Net sales for the comparison period were exceptionally low, which means that the periods are not entirely comparable. A significant part of the 2024 net sales and margin were recognized in the second half of the year, so to get a more accurate picture, it is worth using the whole previous year as a comparison, when net sales were EUR 35.8 million and EBITDA was EUR -0.8 million (-2.2% of net sales). Our strong growth continues to maintain pressure to control cost increases and realize economies of scale in production and deliveries. The efforts to improve profitability will continue. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged: the company's revenue will grow strongly compared to 2024, and EBITDA will be EUR 1–3 million. Solid order intake The green transition, electrification and growth in automation are strong trends that support sales both in Finland and internationally. Growth has been particularly strong in Finnish energy storage projects, and the need for investment is also reflected in the energy efficiency targets of the metal industry. Our order intake was at a strong level at the end of June: EUR 29.3 (46.8) million. The value of new orders in the first half of the year was EUR 26.2 (39.7) million. Our energy storage strategy is yielding results. During the reporting period, we delivered Finland's largest energy storage facility at the time, with a capacity of 38 MW/43 MWh, to Lappeenrannan Energia and eNordic. Our partnership was further strengthened by a follow-up order for another 30 MW/30 MWh energy storage system to be delivered to eNordic and Ardian. During the review period, we also completed several long-term delivery agreements, which were transferred to our lifecycle services, and our cooperation with our customers continues with the support of our service business. In the power quality business, a large active filter order for Egypt still accounts for a significant portion of our order intake. In addition, orders for compensators for the steel industry balance our order intake and its product range. Organization and product development support growth and profitability Our growth has been determined and based on our strong expertise in energy storage and power quality. We are also involved in the market by developing our own energy storage projects, where we can leverage both our technological expertise and our comprehensive understanding of the market. As a result, we can offer our customers the best returns and minimize Merus Power's risks through cost-effective and optimized implementation. We have built both our organization and our technology with a long-term focus on modular and scalable solutions. During the reporting period, we have seen clear evidence of the scalability of both our modular solutions and our expertise. Our number of employees grew by 24 to 151 in the first half of the year. The systematic growth of our personnel strengthens our ability to implement our growth strategy and ensure that we can deliver on our customer promises in the future. Investing in our own energy storage system With our own energy storage facility, Merus Power is able to meet product development needs and test the properties of energy storage in a real market environment. This has been a significant investment in the development of technology and services and demonstrates our commitment to market leadership. The development environment enables the continuous optimization of trading services and system operations. At the end of the review period in June, the company carried out a directed share issue to strengthen its equity capital and secure financing and other prerequisites for growth. The successful share issue raised approximately EUR 2.0 million, which will support the company's strategy in the short and medium term by improving profitability.

CEO KARI TUOMALA: IMPROVING PROFITABILITY SUPPORTS STRONG GROWTH In the first half of 2025, our revenue grew strongly to EUR 24.9 (6.7) million. This growth was driven in particular by successful deliveries of modular energy storage solutions in Finland and the delivery of power quality solutions and products to international customers. The development was driven by active demand in both the energy storage business supporting renewable energy and the power quality market, which promotes energy efficiency. During the review period, we succeeded in improving the profitability of the company's operations. We improved the productization of our deliveries, which resulted in greater efficiency in the operations of our own factory. In addition, we were able to leverage the experience and expertise gained from previous deliveries. Our operating margin (EBITDA) for the first half of the year was approximately EUR 0.3 million positive, whereas in the comparison period it was approximately EUR 3.4 million negative. Net sales for the comparison period were exceptionally low, which means that the periods are not entirely comparable. A significant part of the 2024 net sales and margin were recognized in the second half of the year, so to get a more accurate picture, it is worth using the whole previous year as a comparison, when net sales were EUR 35.8 million and EBITDA was EUR -0.8 million (-2.2% of net sales). Our strong growth continues to maintain pressure to control cost increases and realize economies of scale in production and deliveries. The efforts to improve profitability will continue.

In addition, orders for compensators for the steel industry balance our order intake and its product range. Organization and product development support growth and profitability Our growth has been determined and based on our strong expertise in energy storage and power quality. We are also involved in the market by developing our own energy storage projects, where we can leverage both our technological expertise and our comprehensive understanding of the market. As a result, we can offer our customers the best returns and minimize Merus Power's risks through cost-effective and optimized implementation. We have built both our organization and our technology with a long-term focus on modular and scalable solutions. During the reporting period, we have seen clear evidence of the scalability of both our modular solutions and our expertise. Our number of employees grew by 24 to 151 in the first half of the year. The systematic growth of our personnel strengthens our ability to implement our growth strategy and ensure that we can deliver on our customer promises in the future. Investing in our own energy storage system With our own energy storage facility, Merus Power is able to meet product development needs and test the properties of energy storage in a real market environment. This has been a significant investment in the development of technology and services and demonstrates our commitment to market leadership. The development environment enables the continuous optimization of trading services and system operations. At the end of the review period in June, the company carried out a directed share issue to strengthen its equity capital and secure financing and other prerequisites for growth. The successful share issue raised approximately EUR 2.0 million, which will support the company's strategy in the short and medium term by improving profitability.

The guidance,Interim Report Q2 2025: Commercial and operational agility drove market share gains and 46% EBITA growth,"Interim Report Q2 2025: Commercial and operational agility drove market share gains and 46% EBITA growth Published: 2025-08-21 06:59:30 CEST GN Store Nord A/S - Half Year financial report Interim Report Q2 2025: Commercial and operational agility drove market share gains and 46% EBITA growth Highlights The Hearing division delivered 8% organic revenue growth driven by broad-based market share gains of ReSound Vivia across global markets growing below structural trends. The strong growth led to 12% growth in divisional profit, equaling a divisional profit margin of 36% driven by operating leverage The Enterprise division was – as expected – challenged by market uncertainty due to the global trade environment. The organic revenue growth was -7% due to the market uncertainty and a difficult comparison base, while being supported by strong progress in FalCom. The divisional profit margin ended at 34% as a result of pricing discipline and cost focus, offsetting the direct tariff costs The Gaming division was – as expected – challenged by the tariff environment and weak consumer sentiment. Despite these challenges, Gaming performed well leading to 0% organic revenue growth on top of a very challenging comparison base. The divisional profit margin (excluding wind-down effects) ended at 12% as a result of pricing discipline and one-company supply chain benefits Group reported EBITA increased 46% to DKK 546 million (EBITA margin of 13%), reflecting gross margin improvements, strong cost focus due to the group-wide cost program and no extraordinary costs Free cash flow excl. M&A ended at DKK 353 million reflecting the earnings profile and positive impact on working capital. Net interest-bearing debt ended at DKK 9,850 million, equaling a reported leverage of 4.0x (reported leverage of 4.9x in Q2 2024) Following a successful execution in the first half of the year, and GN’s company-wide agility, the financial guidance for 2025 is confirmed. The organic revenue growth guidance of -3% to +3% (excluding wind-down effects) is narrowed to -2% to +2%. The guidance on EBITA-margin and free cash flow excl.

M&A (DKK million) Updated Prior Confirmed Confirmed -2% to +2% -3% to +3% 11% to 13% ~800 Key revenue assumptions for financial guidance 2025 Hearing division GN is exposed to an attractive hearing aid market, which has historically been growing 4-6% in volumes driven by ongoing favorable demographic trends. With an assumed -1% yearly ASP impact, the structural market value growth assumptions of 3-5%. As a consequence of the slower beginning of the year driven by the uncertain macroeconomic environment, it is currently expected that the market in 2025 will grow slower than its structural trend. Based on the strong sales momentum of ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi, GN in 2025 expects to continue to gain market share. In the beginning of 2025, we assumed the Hearing division to contribute with organic revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Due to the lower market growth assumption, it is currently assumed that the Hearing division will grow at the lower half of that range. Enterprise division The uncertainty and change in the trade environment are impacting our Enterprise division. We have taken significant actions to further diversify our manufacturing footprint to mitigate this, and we have also implemented targeted price adjustments in the US. With these initiatives in place, we are progressing well towards the existing assumptions for the year. In April 2025, we assumed the Enterprise division would contribute with organic revenue growth of -8% to 0%, and we are continuing to assume a contribution in the middle of this range. Gaming division Similar to the Enterprise market, the Gaming market is also impacted by the change in trade environment and general weak consumer sentiment. We have taken several mitigation actions including diversification of our manufacturing footprint and targeted price increases. These initiatives work well. In April 2025, we assumed the Gaming division to contribute with organic revenue growth of -6% to +2% (excluding the impact from the wind-down). Driven by the strong execution in the first half of the year, the Gaming division is now assuming to contribute with organic revenue growth in the upper half of that range. Key EBITA margin assumptions for the financial guidance of 2025 In light of the evolving changes in the global trade environment, GN launched significant mitigating actions in May 2025 to protect Group profitability. These significant actions included but were not limited to 1) Acceleration of diversification of manufacturing footprint; 2) U.S. price increases for Enterprise and Gaming; 3) Group-wide cost and cash initiatives. In the quarter, the changing trade environment has been managed well. The efforts to diversify the supply chain are continuing in line with original plans. Thanks to this diversification, the group-wide cost control efforts and the commercial actions that were taken across Enterprise and Gaming, the overall impact is being mitigated well. We are continuously assessing the developments and additional prudent and diligent actions will be taken as needed going forward. It is currently expected that the net impact from tariffs will impact group EBITA margin by around -1% in 2025 (as earlier communicated), of which around 0.5% has a more temporary effect. Quotes from Executive Management Peter Karlstromer, CEO of GN Store Nord, comments: “ While the macro-economic environment continues to pose challenges to GN and to our customers, we are very pleased with our execution and the progress we are making. In Hearing, our Vivia launch is going very well, leading to market share gains around the world. In Enterprise and Gaming, we have continued the diversification of our supply chain and also taken constructive commercial actions to manage the changing trade environment. We have done this well with limited negative impact while continuing to serve our customers with no disruption. All in all, we are gradually taking ourselves through a challenging period and remain very excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us across our markets and our group. Thanks to all customers, partners and employees for making this possible.” Financial overview Q2 2025 GN Store Nord Hearing division Enterprise division Gaming division Gaming Consumer DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Revenue 4,160 4,499 -8% 1,858 1,792 4% 1,713 1,873 -9% 589 611 -4% 0 223 -100% Organic growth 0%* 5% 8% 10% -7% -1% 0% 12% -100% 3% Gross profit 2,313 2,334 -1% 1,152 1,131 2% 961 1,015 -5% 191 186 3% 9 2 350% Gross profit margin 55.6% 51.9% 3.7%p 62.0% 63.1% -1.1%p 56.1% 54.2% 1.9%p 32.4% 30.4% 2.0%p NA 0.9% NA Divisional profit 1,323 1,239 7% 668 598 12% 583 651 -10% 70 2 Divisional profit margin 31.8% 27.5% 4.3%p 36.0% 33.4% 2.6%p 34.0% 34.8% -0.8%p 11.9% NA EBITA 546 374 46% EBITA margin 13.1% 8.3% 4.8%p Free cash flow excl.

Group revenue and EBIT in the first half of 2025 were record-high and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 2.3 billion, respectively. This can be compared to the same period last year with DKK 121 million in revenue and DKK -21 million in EBIT. A very significant improvement with the recognition of the upfront payment in the AbbVie-deal as the main explanation. Henrik Blou, CEO of Gubra said: “The first half year has been transformational, in a very positive way. We struck the biggest out-licensing deal so far for Gubra for our Amylin anti-obesity asset GUBamy. The partnership with AbbVie really underscores Gubra’s expertise in the metabolic space and our ability to develop novel peptide-based therapeutics. Following the deal, we decided to distribute DKK 1 billion to shareholders as an extraordinary dividend. A real strength for biotech company to be able to distribute a very meaningful amount back to shareholders while still maintaining sufficient capital to realize our strategy in the coming years. GUBAMY – PROGRESSING AS PLANNED In the second quarter, we published strong interim clinical results from the first part of the Phase 1 Multiple-Ascending-Dose study (MAD). The results exceeded our expectations. The study showed that GUBamy was well tolerated with adverse events being predominantly GI related, mild and consistent with data from the previous Single-Ascending-Dose study (SAD). On weight reduction, GUBamy delivered a remarkable weight loss. Once-weekly administration for six weeks of 1 mg or 2 mg GUBamy led to a dose dependent mean weight loss compared to a weight gain in the placebo group. LS Mean weight loss in the 2 mg cohort was -7.8% compared to an LS Mean weight gain of +2.0% in the placebo arm on day 43. The MAD study for testing higher doses during a longer treatment period is ongoing and is progressing as planned. As part of having AbbVie as partner, we are delighted to see them expanding development options in the study. Their experience and scale make a real difference. ADVANCING OUR UCN2 OBESITY PROGRAM We are equally enthusiastic about our next-in-line internal obesity program, UCN2, which is designed to promote a high-quality weight loss. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that UCN2 analogues, when administered alone, selectively reduce fat mass and simultaneously promote gains in lean body mass. When combined with other anti-obesity agents, UCN2 has shown the unique ability to completely prevent the loss of lean mass typically seen in diet-induced obese rats treated with agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Notably, UCN2 has also been shown to fully reverse the lean mass loss caused by prior semaglutide treatment. This positions UCN2 as a potentially valuable component in combination regimens, acting both as a protective and restorative agent. Beyond its metabolic effects, treatment with long-acting UCN2 analogues has resulted in improvements in cardiac and kidney function in preclinical models of chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. UCN2 is now being prepared for Phase 1 clinical study to start early 2026. GROUP REVENUE AND EARNINGS UP VERY SIGNIFICANTLY Group revenue and EBIT in the first half of 2025 were record-high and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 2.3 billion, respectively. This can be compared to the same period last year with DKK 121 million in revenue and DKK -21 million in EBIT. A very significant improvement with the recognition of the upfront payment in the AbbVie-deal as the main explanation. CRO BUSINESS – REVENUE SLIGHTLY BEHIND LAST YEAR Our CRO business has grown very significantly over the last two years and revenue has by far outpaced our mid-term annual growth guidance of 10%. In Q2 2025, we reported revenue of DKK 55 million which is 12% up compared to Q2 2024. However, H1 2025 revenue is 2% behind H1 2024, i.e. somewhat below our expectations. The explanation being the US market where we generally see longer decision timelines among our customers. The development in Europe is on the contrary very healthy with high growth in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. As a result of the slowdown we experience in the US, we have adjusted our full-year 2025 outlook for CRO revenue to be slightly below the revenue level in 2024 (previously 10-20% growth). EBIT- margin expectation for full-year 2025 for the CRO business has been reduced to around 20% (previously 25-31%). HANDING OVER THE BATON TO INCOMING CEO After almost 10 years in Gubra it is time for me now to hand over the baton to a new incoming CEO. I am really excited and proud of what we have achieved that has propelled Gubra into a completely different league. I have always admired leaders who found an appropriate point in time to step back, and I feel that now is the right time. I genuinely wish to thank the founders, the Board and our shareholders for all the trust and also all the fantastic colleagues that have brought Gubra to where we are today. It feels incredibly rewarding to leave the company in such a strong position, with significant potential still ahead, as Markus Rohrwild takes over as CEO starting September 8, 2025.” Key financial highlights for Q2 2025 Key ratio CRO segment D&P segment Group DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Revenue 54.9 49.0 2,379.7 6.6 2,434.6 55.6 Organic revenue growth 12% 18% 35956% -38% 4279% 7% Reported Cost of Sales & Opex -41.3 -38.9 -124.3 -36.2 -165.9 -75.3 Adj.

EBITDA amounted to SEK –12.4 million (–22.9). The reduced loss is mainly due to increased sales, combined with reduced operating costs. EBIT amounted to SEK –12.8 million (–25.5). Profit before tax amounted to SEK –13.1 million (–24.8). Earnings per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK –0.40 (–1.17). Cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 3.1 million (3.1) as of June 30, 2025. First half-year, January 1 – June 30, 2025 Net sales increased by 53 percent to SEK 88.5 million (57.7). The reason for sales increasing is the same as for the quarter. EBITDA amounted to SEK –15.5 million (–44.9). The reason for the reduced loss is the same as for the quarter. EBIT amounted to SEK –16.3 million (–50.2). Profit before tax amounted to SEK –18.6 million (–48.7). Earnings per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK –0.56 (–2.29). Cash and cash equivalents amounted to SEK 3.1 million (3.1) as of June 30, 2025. Significant events during the second quarter On April 14, 2025, Goodbye Kansas Studios received a significant order from a new commercial customer for the production of content for a large immersive video installation, a partially new market with interesting business opportunities. The total order value amounts to approximately SEK 20 million and the project will continue until the third quarter of 2025. At the Annual General Meeting on April 16, 2025, Per Anders Wärn, Staffan Eklöw, Thomas Lindgren, Naveen Paul and Rajeev Sharma were re-elected to the Board of Directors. Per Anders Wärn was re-elected as Chairman of the Board. On June 19, 2025, Goodbye Kansas Studios received a significant order from a new international customer for the production of a game trailer, in-game content, and motion capture for a game project. The total value of the order amounts to approximately SEK 31 million. The project will run until the first quarter of 2026. Significant events after the period On July 2, 2025, Goodbye Kansas Studios received an order from an existing international customer for the production of a new game trailer for a game project. The value of the order amounts to approximately SEK 8 million. The project will run until the fourth quarter of 2025. On August 4, 2025, Goodbye Kansas Studios received another large order from an existing international customer for the production of game cinematics for a game project. The value of the order amounts to a total of approximately SEK 29 million. The project has been initiated and will run until the second quarter of 2026. Thomas Lindgren has been appointed acting CEO of Goodbye Kansas Group. He will take office on Monday, August 25, succeeding Stefan Danieli. Thomas has been a board member of Goodbye Kansas since 2024 and has extensive experience as both CEO and board member in the gaming industry. He holds a degree in economics and business administration and was previously Chairman of Goodbye Kansas Game Invest, where he was responsible for strategic development and also led the sale of Game Invest to Embracer Group together with management. CEO comments Dear shareholders, After another quarter of strong growth, I can conclude that Goodbye Kansas is on the right track. We report a significant increase in sales compared to the corresponding period last year, a strong improvement in operating cash flow and an improved result, although still negative. We have previously flagged for variations between quarters and increased uncertainty in the market, but we remain fundamentally positive about the company’s outlook for the second half of the year and the financial year as a whole. The gaming market continues to drive our sales, but we were also pleased to secure an order for content for an immersive video installation during the quarter, a partly new market for us but where we hope to grow the business in the future. We have also secured some VFX projects, which is positive as it indicates that this segment has also begun its recovery. Third consecutive quarter with strong sales growth Sales in the second quarter increased by 59 percent to SEK 43.1 million with improvements in both EBITDA to SEK –12.4 million and operating cash flow, which totaled SEK –10.6 million. Sales are once again primarily driven by gaming projects, but the order for an immersive video installation also had a significant positive impact on sales. We were also able to secure a number of other new large orders during the quarter. Unfortunately, our margins were negatively impacted in the quarter due to some delayed production starts of projects, which caused lower utilization of staff. We have also seen a somewhat negative impact on earnings due to currency effects resulting from fluctuations primarily between SEK and USD. Our sales efforts have continued to yield results also after the quarter, as we have so far secured orders totalling more than SEK 40 million. This will drive continued sales growth in the second half of the year, which is a prerequisite for achieving profitability. Our focused sales work is yielding results in the market, while our production organization is fully focused on delivering quality, efficiency and creative content that lives up to customers’ high expectations. Additional orders for ongoing projects as well as new orders from returning customers clearly demonstrate the competence and capability of our production organization. Continued restrained development for VFX The VFX market has started to generate some sales volumes, but not yet of substantial size – however, customer activity has increased significantly. We are in concrete dialogues with a number of customers in both North America and the UK, where we believe that we have good opportunities of winning new assignments. Overall, we see significant revenue potential, in projects of various sizes, although more substantial revenues may take another quarter or so to materialize. At the same time, we continue to make progress in establishing our joint venture with NY VFXWAALA in India. The newly recruited COO is leading intensive recruitment efforts of production staff and we are very pleased with the strong response we have received. An expanded production capacity in Mumbai is crucial for us to be able to meet growing demand and order volume in a tougher competition, with improved margins. Several of the orders received during and after the quarter will be partly produced in our Indian joint venture company. Outlook Goodbye Kansas continues to grow and create the pre-conditions for robust profitability, but as this quarter shows, volatility is still relatively high. However, it is important to remember that Goodbye Kansas will be able to achieve positive EBITDA at significantly lower sales levels than has historically been the case thanks to comprehensive restructuring measures. We have previously communicated that uncertainty in the world around us has increased which makes the company’s markets more difficult to assess. At the same time we have secured new orders at a good pace and the orders we won during and after the quarter will drive revenues in the second half of this year, and into 2026. In addition, customer demand remains high, and customers have increasingly started to confirm orders earlier in negotiations, even though they do not immediately materialize in signed contracts. Of course, this is fundamentally positive and we are continuously working to formalize all assignments as quickly as possible through signed agreements. Our offering is niche while the market is substantial, and we are working purposefully to offer services in several market segments with good growth potential, which can be seen through recent orders for immersive videos. We also see increased activity in existing markets going forward, both in the US and Europe. A development that has accelerated this year is gaming companies’ strategic shift to increasingly outsource development and production. The gaming market is still considered to be our most important market going forward, but we are confident that VFX services will once again become an important source of revenue for Goodbye Kansas thanks to our strong offering. We also have ambitions regarding the product segment Animation, where we have hopes to win assignments in the future. Projects in animation often have a different and longer distribution over time, which contributes to a good and stabilizing product mix. A business-driven organization Goodbye Kansas is in an exciting transition with a strong customer offering, a well-established market position, growth and progressively better results while we also work to realize exciting development opportunities. It was against this background that I announced my intention to resign in late 2024, to hand over to new forces that can lead the company, and today we announced that board member Thomas Lindgren will take over as the company’s new CEO. Having worked closely with Thomas during his time on the Board, I am confident that he is the right man to take over the leadership of Goodbye Kansas. Thomas has a solid foundation in the gaming industry, a strong network in the market and well-established personal contacts among many of our customers and has been a fan of Goodbye Kansas for many years. Thomas is ideally placed to drive growth while maintaining cost control, strengthening the market position and at the same time supporting the company’s innovation and business development. With this report, I end my term as CEO of Goodbye Kansas Group – together with the Board, management and all employees, I have had the opportunity to initiate and complete a significant restructuring of the business. The process has been challenging in several respects and not without setbacks, but we have come through this and created a stronger Goodbye Kansas Group that is on the right track, and which has strong potential for profitable growth in several market segments. Finally, I would like to extend a warm thank you to Goodbye Kansas’ customers, investors, partners and employees, and of course wish Thomas the best of luck on the road ahead with Goodbye Kansas.

This was driven by continued growth in Endoscopy Solutions, which grew 15.9%, and solid performance in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, which grew 6.4%. This brings the organic growth for the first nine months to 14.3% and the EBIT margin to 13.9%. The financial guidance for organic revenue growth for 2024/25 is updated to reflect the continued solid growth and is now expected to be 12-14% (previously 11-14%). “I am pleased with the continued solid growth momentum in our third quarter. With 15.9% growth in Endoscopy Solutions and portfolio expansions in pulmonology and urology, we are deepening our presence in high-growth markets. On the back of solid revenue performance in Endoscopy Solutions and strong growth in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, we are raising the lower end of our organic revenue guidance to 12-14% for the full year. We maintain our EBIT margin guidance, supported by solid organic growth and operational leverage, even as we navigate FX and tariff-related dynamics. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and execution, which makes this continued progress possible. We look forward to welcoming institutional investors, analysts, and financial media to attend our Capital Markets Day on 1 October 2025, where we will share insights on strategy and market opportunities.” BRITT MEELBY JENSEN Chief Executive Officer Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Business highlights Advancing pulmonology market leadership position with the expansion of Ambu® SureSight™ Connect video laryngoscopy solution for pediatric patients. Strengthened urology offering with FDA clearance for Ambu® aScope™ 5 Cysto HD cysto-nephroscope for PCNL procedures. Continued sustainability leadership with launch of first-of-its-kind endoscope tack-back and recycling program, the Ambu® Recircle Program, in key markets. Scott Heinzelman appointed new President for North America and member of Ambu’s Executive Leadership Team, as of 25 August. Financial highlights Revenue increased organically by 12.0% (15.0%) to DKK 1,507m (DKK 1,383m), with reported growth of 9.0% (15.7%). Organic growth for the first nine months was 14.3% (14.9%), with reported growth of 14.2% (12.9%). Endoscopy Solutions increased organically by 15.9% (18.0%). The Pulmonology business group posted 11.2% (9.9%) organic growth, positively impacted by continued aScope™ 5 Broncho adoption, as well as the newly launched video laryngoscopy solution. The Urology, ENT, & GI business group posted 20.8% (27.6%) organic growth, mainly driven by the aScope™ 4 portfolio, with sustained strong growth momentum for aScope™ 5 Uretero. Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring increased organically by 6.4% (10.9%) and by 11.1% (6.4%) for the first nine months, driven by both volume and price increases. EBIT before special items (b.s.i.) was DKK 170m (DKK 178m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 11.3% (12.9%). EBIT b.s.i. for the first nine months ended at DKK 637m (DKK 498m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 13.9% (12.4%). EBIT margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs but positively impacted by continued operational leverage from solid organic growth. Free cash flow (FCF) before acquisitions totaled DKK 128m (DKK 163m), leaving FCF for the first nine months to DKK 277m. This was impacted by continued higher net working capital to mitigate the global geopolitical uncertainties and support growth, and profitability was impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs. As a result, FCF assumptions for FY 2024/25 are now DKK ~400m (previously DKK +500m). Raise of lower end of organic revenue guidance to 12-14% (previously 11-14%), driven by continued procedure growth and conversion towards single-use solutions. EBIT margin b.s.i. guidance is maintained, with investments continuing as planned to support long-term growth, despite FX headwind and increased tariff costs. 2024/25 financial guidance: Organic revenue growth : 12-14% (previously 11-14%) EBIT margin b.s.i. : 13-15% Q3 2024/25 conference call A conference call is broadcast live today, 22 August 2025 at 11:00 (CEST), via ambu.com/webcastQ32025 .

The operating result for the review period was EUR -2.8 million (-2.7), and the profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). Order book increased by 18% from the end of December last year (H2 2024: 22.2) and amounted to EUR 26.0 million (27.0) at the end of review period. January-June 2025 Honkarakenne Group’s net sales in January–June amounted to EUR 16.7 million (H1 2024: 14.5). Net sales increased by 15% from the corresponding period of the previous year. Operating profit was EUR -2.8 million (-2.7). Profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). Earnings per share was EUR -0.39 (-0.46). The Group’s financial position is strong, with equity ratio of 52.3% (55.7) and net financial liabilities of EUR -0.8 million (-3.2). Honkarakenne’s guidance for 2025 remains unchanged from the guidance updated on 12 February 2025. According to Honkarakenne’s view, the Group’s net sales in 2025 will be slightly higher than in the previous guidance and amount to EUR 38-45 million. The Group’s operating profit is EUR -2.6 – -0.0 million. GROUP’S KEY FIGURES 1–6/2025 1–6/2024 1–12/2024 Net sales, EUR million 16.7 14.5 36.7 Operating profit/loss, EUR million -2.8 -2.7 -2.4 Profit/loss before taxes, EUR million -2.9 -3.3 -2.6 Average number of employees 158 167 157 Average number of employees in person-years 155 159 153 Earnings per share, EUR -0.39 -0.46 -0.37 Equity ratio, % 52.3 55.7 59.7 Return on equity, % -18.6 -18.2 -14.3 Equity per share, EUR 1.93 2.23 2.32 Gearing ratio, % -7.4 -24.6 -3.5 Honkarakenne Oyj’s CEO Marko Saarelainen commented on the half-year report as follows: “As the review period began, the outlook for Finland's housing and construction industry was very challenging. The order intake for the first quarter declined slightly compared to last year. In early summer, the order intake developed positively, and the order book for the review period rose to EUR 26.2 million, an 18% increase from the end of last year. Despite increased net sales and efficiency measures, the operating profit landed in the red at EUR -2.8 million. Profit before tax improved EUR 0.4 million compared to last year but remained loss-making at EUR -2.9 million. Profitability was impacted by the sales mix being weighted towards domestic sales, as the export being lower than in the comparison period. Despite of cost reductions, fixed costs remained too high relative to net sales. This was partly influenced by development projects planned to support future growth and their implementation despite the challenging market conditions. In the domestic B2C business, consumer caution in decision-making was reflected in the order intake for the first half of the year. The domestic B2C business was able to increase net sales compared to last year, but profitability faced challenges. Overall the domestic business result was a hard-won victory in a challenging market, but looking ahead, the business requires efficiency measures to improve profitability. The project business achieved significant percentage growth, but the volume is still quite small. The B2B business began to be actively developed early in the year, both domestically and in exports. The B2B project pipeline is growing, and the outlook in this regard is cautiously positive. In the export business, order intake from Asia fell short of the comparison period. Uncertainties regarding Japanese regulatory requirements have slowed down business during the review period. The situation regarding Japan is likely to continue similarly in the latter half of the year. Order intake in the APAC region remained at the previous year's level, but no net sales were yet recognized during H1. Construction of the first phase of the India project progressed after the review period to a launch event held in July, where guests were able to hear about Honkarakenne's products, get acquainted with completed buildings, and the overall plan for the area development project. The European market area was slightly below the comparison year's order intake, excluding Germany, where orders received and net sales accumulated for the period were growing. Due to the development efforts of the German team, the company expects positive growth in order intake and net sales for consumer and project customers. The outlook for the rest of Europe remains partly challenging. Preparations for the production start of the new non-settling log, launched in May, were made during the first half of the year. After the review period, production of the new non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, started and the first deliveries to customers were made in early August. In the challenging geopolitical situation and Finland's historically weak construction industry cycle, I believe the company's resources, such as its strong market position, robust balance sheet, good financial standing, skilled personnel, and excellent product and collection, will provide Honka with a significant competitive advantage compared to its competitors."" NET SALES Honkarakenne Group’s net sales for the first half of 2025 increased by 15% to EUR 16.7 million (14.5). Honkarakenne presents its set sales data divided in two parts: Finland and Exports. Below we present the net sales based on this division for the first half of 2025 and the second half of 2024 with the comparison year. Geographical distribution of net sales: NET SALES DEVELOPMENT Net sales distribution, % 1–6/2025 1–6/2024 1-12/2024 Finland 80% 73% 71% Exports 20% 27% 29% Total 100 % 100% 100% Net sales, MEUR 1-6/2025 1-6/2024 Change 7-12/2024 1–12/2024 Finland 13.4 10.6 27% 15.6 26.2 Exports 3.3 3.9 -16% 6.6 10.5 Total 16.7 14.5 15% 22.2 36.7 Finland also includes billet sales and the sale of process by-products for recycling. Exports include all other countries except Finland. ORDER BOOK Group’s order book was 3% lower than in the comparison year and amounted to EUR 26.0 million (27.0). The order book increased by +18% from EUR 22.2 million at the end of December last year. This was driven by higher sales in both the domestic consumer business and the project and export business compared to the first and especially the last half of last year. Order book refers to orders with a delivery date within the next 24 months. Some orders may have a financing or building permit condition. TRENDS IN PROFIT AND PFOFITABILITY Operating profit for the review period stood at EUR -2.8 million (-2.7) and the profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). The lower profitability compared to comparison period was impacted by the sales mix being weighted towards domestic business, as the share of exports remained below the comparison period. Some domestic deliveries included winter seasons installation campaigns carried out late last year, which had lower profitability than normally. In addition, fixed costs during the review period were higher than in the comparison period, even though there were cost reductions in operations and temporary layoffs. FINANCING AND INVESTMENT At the end of the review period, Honkarakenne’s financial position was good. The Group’s equity ratio was 52.3% (55.7%) and net gearing ratio was -7.4% (-24.6%). The Group’s net financial liabilities amounted to EUR -0.8 million (-3.2), so the Group’s liquid assets exceeded its financial liabilities. The Group’s liquid assets totalled EUR 5.0 million (6.9). The Group also has a EUR 3.0 (3.0) overdraft facility, which has not been used in the review period or the comparison period. The Group’s gross investments amounted to EUR 0.7 million (0.7), excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with the IFRS 16 standard. Investments during the period mainly related to the replacement investment in the non-settling logs production line at the Karstula mill. PRODUCTS AND MARKET AREAS Honka's collection is being renewed and developed in a market-specific and customer-centric manner, and the design of the collections strongly focuses on the quality of living and the sustainability of buildings. Honka's convertible models are designed to enable a wide range of lifestyle variations, eliminating the need to build or buy new homes when life situations change, and ensuring there is no need to give up a natural, sustainable log house with healthy indoor air quality. In May, the company launched a new fourth-generation non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, whose wider-than-before vertical middle lamella increases the stability of log walls, enabling the construction of even larger projects such as apartment buildings and schools. In addition, the new log features an advanced design profile and a minimal seam groove between the logs, facilitating an easier implementation of modern architecture and various interior styles, as well as the combination of the log with other building materials such as glass, stone and steel. In connection with the launch, interior design concepts supporting the design of interior decoration for Honka log homes and holiday homes, along with the related HonkaLook Book brochure, were published. During the review period, the development of cost-effective leisure home and detached house models for the Finnish and Nordic markets continued, and new collection brochures for the Finnish market were released. In addition, larger-scale Honka Grand Design house models, featuring international architecture, were unveiled, specifically aimed at the company's international markets. Additionally, in the spring, the Pineo accommodation concept, targeted at international and domestic tourism and accommodation businesses, was launched, complete with buildings of various sizes. After the review period, Honka was an exhibitor at the Oulu Housing Fair in Honka Kömmeli, which received great interest. The show home is an architect-designed, individually tailored log house for a young couple building their first home, which features a traditional Finnish loft sauna. The log building represents a modern interpretation of the traditional architecture of the coastal region and the classic red ochre colour. Honka’s operations are certified with the ISO 9001 quality standard and the ISO 14001 environmental standard. In Finland , net sales were 27% higher than in the same period last year at EUR 13.4 million (10.6). The net sales growth resulted from a slightly higher order intake in the project and consumer businesses from the previous year, as well as sales from the beginning of the year that were delivered during the review period. During the review period, domestic orders received were lower than in the comparison period for the consumer business and the project business. The domestic operating environment is still awaiting a more meaningful recovery in terms of construction and new delivery agreements. Demand and order backlog are showing moderate growth. Final decisions on construction starts are delayed or further postponed in the uncertain economic situation. The company expects domestic demand to pick up and turn more favourable, also regarding construction starts. For the remainder of the year, new orders are estimated to reach the previous year's level or slightly higher, particularly in the project business and leisure homes. In exports , net sales were 16% lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year at EUR 3.3 million (3.9). The decline in revenue during the review period was primarily due to the varying delivery schedules of projects under delivery. These were individual deliveries of detached houses and holiday homes mainly to sites located in the Asian and European regions. Received orders were at the comparison period's level, and regional variations across different export countries are significant. In the European region, demand has finally picked up, leading to larger orders as well. Demand and orders received from the Asian region have remained stable. Exports are seeing increased demand and prospects, particularly for various-sized projects. These involve uncertainty regarding the timeframe within which demand could materialize and lead to new orders. Uncertainty regarding the operating environment outlook may weaken and curb increased demand and expected export growth. STRATEGY 2025-2028 The company specified the objectives of its strategy extending to the end of 2024 to better reflect the changes in the operating environment. Through the strategy, Honkarakenne's position as Finland's largest exporter of wooden buildings will be strengthened. With the export and customer experience strategy, the Group aims for controlled growth in net sales during the strategy period, with the focus on profitability. The performance targets are based on process efficiency, conceptualization, and management, which also improve customer and employee experience. Honkarakenne Group's vision is to offer truly the best living. The Group’s mission is to improve the quality of people’s lives and housing. Honkarakenne’s strategic objectives for the 2025–2028 period are: Strengthening customer experience Effectiveness in everything Renewable Honka spirit Managed international operations To implement the strategy, development projects and focus areas supporting the strategy's progress are refined within the Group's extended management team, in accordance with the Objectives and key results model. Honkarakenne states that it does not consider long-term targets as market guidance for any particular year of the strategy period. SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability is a key part of Honkarakenne’s strategy. Honkarakenne Group is continuously developing its production, services and selection to enable healthier, more ecological and better-quality living. Group focuses on building the future and choices are guided by human and natural vitality. Honkarakenne’s sustainability programme, `We are building the future’, is based on the changes we have identified in our operating environment, our ethical principles, recognised expectations of our staff and other stakeholders, and understanding the customer in our markets. As part of Honkarakenne's sustainability programme, the parent company uses 100% electricity produced with renewable energy and certified with a guarantee of origin with carbon dioxide emissions of 0 g/kWh at all its own sites. Honkarakenne also promotes sustainability through its various product solutions. In conjunction with the Rock and Star collection, which was launched during the period, Honka Säästö introduced a solution for safely shutting off both water and heat in living spaces. The solution allows the cottage to be kept unheated in the living areas during the winter season without the risk of freezing water pipes or damaging appliances. Logs as a breathable structure enable sustainable construction and, with the Honka Säästö solution, also electricity savings. THE HONKA BRAND The core of the Honka brand is the close relationship with nature and Finnish happiness. Honka's yellow is the colour of hope and joy. Honka helps every customer realize the dreams that are important to them and Honka has the honour to convey the vitality of the northern forests. SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS Honkarakenne operates in a business that is seasonal by nature. Especially in Finland, construction mostly takes place during summer, so there are more deliveries in summer and autumn than during the winter. Considering the existing market and demand conditions, the company aims to even out this seasonality especially with export activities. During the review period, the company's market situation was challenging in all its areas. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Group’s R&D costs in January-June were EUR 0.2 million (0.3), which was 1.0% (1.8%) of net sales. During the review period, a new fourth-generation non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, was developed, featuring a vertical middle lamella that is wider than before, increasing the stability of log walls and enabling the construction of increasingly larger buildings such as apartment buildings and schools. The new log was launched on the market in the spring and will go into production in early autumn. Honka’s interior design concepts and related new product solutions were developed. New concepts and products, including interior panels, were launched in the spring. During the review period, product solutions for larger buildings continued to be developed, including for the needs of the Honka MultiStorey™ building concept. In addition, the development of the Honka Healthy House™ concept was continued, and the concept was introduced to international markets early in the year. The aim of development projects is to increase the use of wood in construction to promote climate targets. Wood is renewable raw material and wood construction is part of sustainable use of forests. The Group has not capitalized development costs during the review period. PERSONNEL The Group’s average number of personnel, measured in person-years, totalled 155 (159) persons during the first half of the year. The decrease from the comparison period was 4 people. The Group’s average number of personnel, measured by employment relationships was 158 (167) during the first half of the year. During both the review period and the comparison period, the parent company's personnel were laid off varying periods due to low demand, low production and delivery volumes, as well as during a production stoppage, when the installation of a new non-settling log line was carried out. In March 2024, the Board of Directors of the parent company decided, on a share-based incentive program for senior management for the years 2024–2026. The purpose of the plan is to align key employees with the company's objectives and to incentivise the creation of shareholder value. The Performance-Based Share Plan 2024–2026 has a three-year vesting period and the metrics for the period are net sales and operating profit margin. Five people participate in the 2024–2026 incentive program, and the rewards correspond to a maximum of 75,000 shares in total. There were no expenses related to the incentive scheme during the reporting period. In March, a joint staff day was held at the Karstula factory for personnel and domestic representatives. In addition to spending time together, they were able to familiarize themselves with the production line for the new non-settling log, which was completed earlier this year, and learn about its operations. EXECUTIVE GROUP During the review period the Executive Group consisted of: Marko Saarelainen, CEO; Eino Hekali, Vice President, Product; Maarit Jylhä, CFO; Petri Perttula, Business Vice President, Operations Global B2B; and Juhani Saukko, Business Vice President, Operations Finland B2C.

The company’s share capital has not changed, remaining at EUR 9,897,936.00. Each class B share entitles to one (1) vote and a class A share to twenty (20) votes, bringing to total number of votes conferred by the shares during the review period to 11,913,243. Honkarakenne’s class B shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd’s Small Cap list with the ticker HONBS. The highest price of the listed class B share was EUR 3.05, and the lowest price was EUR 2.37.

At the end of the report period, the parent company held 321,052 of its own Series B shares with a total purchase price of EUR 1,186,556.34. Own shares account for 5.17% of all Honkarakenne shares and 2.69% of all votes. The acquisition cost of own shares reduces the free equity of both the parent company and the Group. FLAGGING NOTIFICATIONS No flagging notifications were received during the review period. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Honkarakenne Oyj complied with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies issued by the Securities Market Association in 2025. For more information about corporate governance, go to SHORT-TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The main risks and uncertainties of Honkarakenne relate to negative changes in the operating environment of the company and its customers, increased costs of raw materials and components, their availability and the functioning of the overall supply chains. If demand falls sharply in the operating environment and costs remain high, it may have significant effects on the company’s earnings development. The economic uncertainty in the Group’s operating environment is negatively reflected in business and consumer confidence. Economic risks continue to be driven by consumer confidence and employment concerns, inflation, interest rates and access to financing. The uncertainty of the military aggression initiated by Russia and all its effects on business are difficult to assess. Replacing the order book lost in the Russian and Ukrainian market area with other export markets may be prolonged or uncertain in the current global market situation. If the war is further prolonged or escalates, or if the instability in the Middle East would spread more widely, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and results of operations. The valuation of items in the balance sheet is based on the management’s current estimates. Any changes to these estimates may affect the company’s financial performance. REPORTING This report contains statements that relate to the future, and these statements are based on hypotheses that the company's management hold currently, and on the decisions and plans that are currently in place. Although the management believes that the hypotheses relating to the future are well-founded, there is no guarantee that the said hypotheses will prove to be correct. The half-year report has not been audited and the figures are unaudited. Figures in brackets refer to the corresponding period one year earlier, unless otherwise stated. Honkarakenne complies with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). An APM is a financial measure of performance other than a financial measure defined or specified in IFRS. Therefore, instead of the previous term ‘without non-recurring items’, the term ‘adjusted’ is used. The company classifies significant business transactions that are considered to affect comparisons between different reporting periods as adjustment items. Such transactions include significant reorganisation expenses, significant impairment losses or reversals thereof, significant capital gains and losses on assets, and other significant non-customary income or expenses. This half-year report bulletin has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. The half-year report bulletin should be read together with the 2024 financial statements. The accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are the same as in the financial statements for 2024, with the exception of standards and interpretations that have come into force on January 1 2025 or thereafter. The impact of the new standards and interpretations is described later in the section “New standards and interpretations”. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD There are no significant events. OUTLOOK FOR 2025 (published on 12 February 2025) According to Honkarakenne’s view, the Group’s net sales in 2025 will be slightly higher than in the previous guidance and amount to EUR 38-45 million. The Group’s operating profit is EUR -2.6 – -0.0 million. BASIS FOR THE OUTLOOK The company's outlook for the 2025 development is based on the existing order book, the expectation of challenges in the operating environment and on market development. Uncertainty about the development of the economic situation in Finland, interest rates and availability of financing may negatively affect demand from consumer and professional builders and their decision-making concerning construction, thus creating uncertainty in the starts of new construction projects. The company sees that strategic focus on export markets holds potential and supports profitable growth.

The half-year report bulletin should be read together with the 2024 financial statements. The accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are the same as in the financial statements for 2024, with the exception of standards and interpretations that have come into force on January 1 2025 or thereafter. The impact of the new standards and interpretations is described later in the section “New stardards and interpretations”. The Financial Statement Bulletin has not been audited and the figures are unaudited. The figures presented in the bulletin are rounded, so the sum of individual figures may differ from the amount shown. Figures in brackets refer to the corresponding period one year earlier, unless otherwise stated. New standards and interpretations The new standards or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2025 did not have a material impact on the figures presented for the review period. Alternative performance measures Honkarakenne complies with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). An APM is a financial measure of performance other than a financial measure defined or specified in IFRS. Therefore, instead of the previous term ‘without non-recurring items’, the term ‘adjusted’ is used. The company classifies significant business transactions that are considered to affect comparisons between different reporting periods as adjustment items. Such transactions include significant reorganisation expenses, significant impairment losses or reversals thereof, significant capital gains and losses on assets, and other significant non-customary income or expenses. In Honkarakenne’s view, Alternative Performance Measures provide significant additional information to management, investors, securities analysts and other parties on Honkarakenne’s operational result, financial position and cash flows, and are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties. Return on equity, equity ratio, net financial liabilities and gearing are presented as supplementary key figures, as in the company’s view they are useful indicators for assessing Honkarakenne’s ability to acquire financing and pay its debts. In addition, gross investments and R&D expenditure provide additional information on needs related to Honkarakenne’s operational cash flow. Segments Honkarakenne has two geographical operating segments that are combined into one segment for reporting purposes. Geographically, sales are divided as follows: Finland and Exports. As management’s internal reporting complies with IFRS reporting, separate reconciliations are not presented. Other notes to the report Related party transactions The Group’s related parties consist of subsidiaries and associated companies; the company's manage-ment and any companies in which they exert influence; and those involved in the Saarelainen share-holder agreement and any companies controlled by them. The management personnel considered to be related parties comprise the Board of Directors, President & CEO, and the company's Executive Group. The pricing of goods and services in transactions with related parties conforms to market-based pricing. During the review period, ordinary business transactions with related parties were made as follows: sales of goods and services to related parties amounted to EUR 0.1 million (0.1) and purchases from related parties to EUR 0.2 million (0.2). Financial statement of the Group include EUR 0.0 million (0.0) liabilities to related parties and EUR 0.0 million (0.0) receivables from related parties. No bad debts were recognised from related parties in 2025 or 2024. At the time of financial statements, the parent company has claims from subsidiaries of EUR 1.5 million (1.1) and debts to subsidiaries of EUR 0.1 million (0.1).

Second Quarter Highlights Record sales revenue of SEK 9,4M, a 67% year-over-year increase compared with the second quarter 2024 Minimal short-term impact from U.S.–EU tariffs US-FDA review underway for expanded labeling of ClearPoint Prism® to include 1.5T MRI compatibility, doubling the TAM in U.S Strong team and partner performance, continued market expansion, and a structurally lower cost base Board of directors strenghted with expertice in the neuro market and supply chain management to support continued growth Financial position remains on track ahead of TO8B warrant exercise in September Summary of the interim report (relates to the Group) First six months (01/01/2025–06/30/2025) Net sales totaled SEK 13,858,000 (SEK 8,762,000). Operating profit totaled SEK -10,775,000 (SEK -29,865,000). Profit/loss after financial items totaled SEK - 21,578,000 (SEK -26,163,000). Basic and diluted earnings per share totaled SEK -0,92 (SEK -3,46). The equity ratio on June 30, 2025, was 90% (63%). The second quarter (04/01/2025–06/30/2025) Net sales totaled SEK 9,362,000 (SEK 5,622,000). Operating profit totaled SEK -2,907,000 (SEK -12,873,000). Profit/loss after financial items totaled SEK -6,348,000 (SEK -13,592,000). Basic and diluted earnings per share totaled SEK -0,28 (SEK -1,87). The equity ratio on June 30, 2025, was 90% (63%). Significant events in the second quarter of 2025 CLS announced the submission of its 510(k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for expanding the indication of ClearPoint Prism to also include 1.5 T MRI guidance. At the Annual General Meeting, held 27 June 2025, the meeting resolved to re-elect Peter Max as a member of the Board of Directors and to elect Lena Höglund, Veronica Byfield, Thomas Binzer and Jerker Nygren. Peter Max was re-elected as Chairman of the Board. Significant events after the end of the period There were no significant events following the end of the quarter. Comments from CEO Dan J. Mogren The second quarter of 2025 reflects continued strong execution of our strategic and operational priorities and with sales in the quarter at record levels. Continued Revenue Growth & Cost Discipline Revenue grew by 67% compared to Q2 last year, driven by a particularly strong performance in our neurosurgery segment and exceptionally high sales volumes to our partner Clearpoint Neuro. This growth, combined with continued cost discipline, resulted in a gross margin of 70%, well above our full-year target of 60%, and a reduction in operating expenses of more than 30% versus the second quarter of 2024. For the first six months, Revenue growth was 58%, Gross Margin 69% and OPEX reduced more than 30% vs. 2024. U.S.-EU Trade Deal The recently announced U.S.–EU trade deal establishes a general 15% tariff ceiling on most EU goods, but the treatment of medical devices remains uncertain. While discussions continue and the impact on our business is minimal today, we continue to monitor the development. 510(k) Submission under review by US-FDA In late April, CLS submitted its 510(k) application to U.S. FDA to expand the labeling of the ClearPoint Prism® Neuro Laser Therapy System to include image guidance also with 1.5T MRI scanners. The application is currently under FDA review. Upon clearance, this label expansion would significantly broaden patient access to MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (NeuroLITT), allowing for accelerating adoption and growth even further. Strengthening of the Board of Directors In the second quarter, CLS also strengthened its governance with the election of four new members to the Board of Directors, as approved by our shareholders at the AGM on June 27. I am pleased that Peter Max continues in his role as Chairman, providing continuity as we welcome new perspectives and expertise within areas important to CLS, such as the neuro market and supply chain management, to support the company’s next phase of growth. Outlook Remains Strong Our long-term growth outlook remains strong, supported by solid partner relationships, continued market expansion in neurosurgery, and a robust pipeline of opportunities. With revenue growth and margins both exceeding targets, and our cost base structurally lower, we are confident in our ability to sustain high double-digit growth for 2025. Our financial position remains on plan, positioning CLS well ahead of the planned TO8B warrant exercise in September and enabling us to continue creating value for shareholders while advancing the commercial rollout of our technology with our strategic upstream and downstream partners. CLS Vision In a rapidly evolving global environment, it is essential for CLS to combine strong operational execution with a clear long-term vision. Our commitment is to ensure that shareholders, partners, and clinicians remain aligned with the transformative journey we are pursuing. Surgery is entering a new era. Advances in imaging, artificial intelligence, and minimally invasive techniques are converging with the growing medical need created by an increasing incidence of disorders worldwide that require surgery. Together, these factors are accelerating the adoption of image-guided minimally invasive surgery — not only to enhance surgical precision, but also to shorten recovery times, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes. CLS’s vision is to be at the forefront of this transformation. Through our synergistic partnership with Clearpoint Neuro, we are uniquely positioned to lead the global adoption of MR image-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (NeuroLITT) within neurosurgery. By combining CLS’s precision laser ablation technology with Clearpoint Neuro’s advanced neuro-navigation systems, we enable clinicians to safely and effectively treat patients with conditions that have previously been difficult to manage. This sets the stage for a new standard of care in neurosurgery. Looking ahead, we remain committed to building a sustainable business model with recurring revenues, expanding access to our technology, and creating long-term value for patients, healthcare providers, and shareholders alike. Shareholder Value The commitment of our shareholders is instrumental in our progress and in driving our mission to revolutionize the surgical treatment with image-guided precision laser technology. We believe our journey forward will not only advance surgical treatment but also create significant value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to your active participation in the exciting developments to come. Dan J.

The quarter in brief APRIL – JUNE 2025 Net sales of EUR 4 206 149, an increase of 14.1 % (compared to EUR 3 685 468 in Q2 2024) EBITDA of EUR 336 650 (371 498) and EBITDA margin of 8.0 % (10.1 %) EBIT of EUR 292 563 (327 665) and EBIT margin of 7.0 % (8.9 %) Net Earnings After Tax of EUR 164 193 (150 292) and net EAT margin of 3.9 % (4.1 %) January – JUNE 2025 Net sales of EUR 8 433 010, an increase of 10.1 % (compared to EUR 7 659 197 in H1 2024) EBITDA of EUR 958 313 (805 219) and EBITDA margin of 11.4% (10.5 %) EBIT of EUR 875 695 (717 864) and EBIT margin of 10.4 % (9.4 %) Net Earnings After Tax of EUR 506 798 (315 983) and net EAT margin of 6.0 % (4.1 %) aPRIL – jUNE key developments Growth was surprisingly strong at 14.1% year-on-year despite a weak US$. The transition from last year’s ""Reduce to the MAX"" efficiency program to a new phase of controlled growth has gone off to a good start Impressive Operational Cashflow of EUR 422 thousand in Q2, partly explained by the unusually large amount of invoiced services at the end of the first quarter 2025 New targets and vision for year 2030 were communicated: 17% annual growth, 14% EBITDA, zero net debt, cashflow generation Growth of existing revenue streams combined with new technology revenues The business in Pakistan signed major contracts, and started to ramp up operations The US business re-started with a small network deployment contract An extraordinary audit was initiated, delaying the publication of the annual report Sales activities ramped up in all markets, resulting in business opportunities and several new agreements – but also resulting in increased costs that temporarily lead to lower margins The first test run of Talkpool’s share options scheme was successful in the money. The share price increased from EUR 0.45 in March 2024 to EUR 1.25 in June 2025. This is good news for shareholders and key staff alike as the share options scheme continues with three additional phases until 2031. This is Talkpool Talkpool works behind the scenes to plan, build and improve large communication networks. The company partners with Original Equipment Manufacturers to distribute, integrate and maintain technology that enhances telecommunication infrastructure. Competence includes planning, implementation, project management, optimization and maintenance of fixed and mobile telecom networks. After a turnaround period that has taken several years, the business is accelerating growth in 2025. Talkpool has global geographical reach and experience, but it has reduced its geographical focus to three hubs: Europe: business in Germany, Headquarters in Switzerland and a Swedish legacy business Americas: business in the Caribbean and regional hub in Miami, USA Asia: outsourcing hub in Pakistan and small consultancy in Saudi Arabia Management Comments The second quarter (Q2 2025) was marked by a substantial increase in market activities. Attendance in German trade shows resulted in over 50 personal client contacts and initial negotiations with several large prospects. The American business generated a long list of new business opportunities, and we entered negotiations and signed first contracts. The Pakistani business has been very successful in negotiating new agreements. The Pakistani operation has made large investments in tools and staff in May and June. A gradual increase of revenues is expected for the Pakistani business during the second half of 2025. After years of streamlining the business and carrying out efficiency-enhancing measures such as divestments as well as general cost-cutting, Talkpool entered a growth phase in 2025. Growth increased from 6.4% in Q1 to 14.7% in Q2 (year-on-year vs. same periods in 2024) despite challenging FX and global trends. The growth rate is expected to continue increasing in 2025 and 2026. The US$ lost 11% against the EUR and the PKR (Pakistani Rupee) lost 14% against the EUR from the 1 st of January to the end of June 2025. These currency devaluations had a major negative impact on Talkpool’s growth rate as approximately 70% of total revenues are received in these US$-centric currencies. In Q2 Talkpool invested in network tools, software, laptops, vehicles, hirings of new staff, trainings and a new office in the Dominican Republic. These growth initiatives are generating additional costs that temporarily reduce profit margins. Costs of Sales increased by approximately EUR 200 000 in Q2 2025 (compared to Q1 2025) due to operational ramp-up with investments and hirings. This had a temporary impact on the Gross Margin in Q2 2025 and is expected to continue affecting profit margins for the rest of the year. Costs for Sales, General and Administration also increased during Q2 2025 and are expected to continue increasing. These costs are temporarily reducing operational and net margins. After an initial period of reduced profits, the margins are expected to resurge to reach the 14% EBITDA target while the company grows at approximately 17% per year. The parent company Talkpool AG underwent an extraordinary audit from April to August 2025. To compensate for a reduction in valuation of the Pakistani asset to EUR 1.7 million (based on a DCF-calculation), the valuation of the German asset was increased to approximately EUR 2.1 million. An independent valuation by BDO put the actual market value of Talkpool’s German company to EUR 20.5 million. This extraordinary audit did not have any impact on the consolidated Group. Talkpool’s profit margins decreased in Q2 2025 after a long stable period from year 2022 until Q1 2025. The margin pressure is mainly due to additional costs for business development, sales and ramp-up of operational activities. Profit margins are expected to increase after an interim period of lower margins. The 14% EBITDA target for 2030 can be compared with 10.8% EBITDA in 2024 and 11.4% in the first half of 2025. The TALK share price (ISIN CH0322161768) rose from SEK 7.94 to SEK 14.50 on Nasdaq First North Stockholm. Talkpool made three investor relations appearances in Q2 2025 after a long time of no investor relations activities. ""Vision 2030"" – A Strategic Roadmap for Accelerated Growth Vision 2030 is a forward-looking growth strategy aimed at propelling the company into its next phase of accelerated, sustainable growth. Talkpool has entered a period of change in the following areas: Business model transformation Expansion of service offerings Integration of cutting-edge technologies Strategic positioning in high-growth telecom segments With a strengthened balance sheet, streamlined operations, and a clear strategic direction, Talkpool is well-positioned to capitalize on next-generation telecommunications opportunities, driving long-term value for shareholders and stakeholders alike. The growth is expected to be derived from the following revenue channels: Organic Growth : Planned acceleration from 2025 through 2030 Strategic M&A : Selective acquisitions and potential divestments Market Expansion : Penetration into high-growth telecommunications segments Service Portfolio Enhancement : Introduction of higher-margin technology-enabled services Financial targets for 2030 Revenue : EUR 40 million, representing a CAGR of approximately 16.8% from EUR 15.76 million in 2024, driven by expansion in existing business and new remote services fueled by increased use of technology tools EBITDA Margin : 14% of revenues (compared to 11% Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization in fiscal year 2024) Operational Cash Flow (OCF) : Continued focus on positive cash flow generation (9.1% OCF in 2024) Capital Structure : Zero net debt, followed by strategic cash reserve accumulation Smart Growth Smart growth does not only refer to developing smart technology that enables Talkpool to more efficiently provide services to its clients, but also to a step-by-step approach to growth. Talkpool is not starting growth initiatives in all markets at the same time. Markets are positioned for phased growth, starting with Asia followed by America: The Asia region based in Pakistan is expected to grow fast in the second half of 2025 following a boost of contracts and new orders. In addition to growing revenues, and strengthening sales efforts, the hub in Pakistan has come the furthest in developing and trialing new technologies. The Americas region is expected to increase growth in the second half of 2025 as negotiations with prospects, clients and partners convert into contracts. This market includes USA and the northern part of Latin America. A new entity in the Dominican Republic may be established to meet upcoming orders from the Caribbean region. In addition to telecom network services, clients are interested in (build & operate) services of infrastructure such as solar parks. Europe is the last market to start growth initiatives. A new initiative to drive growth in Germany has been planned from September 2025, but we don’t expect any growth in Europe this year. Topline growth in Germany is set to accelerate in 2026. Talkpool intends to continuously increase its focus on northern Europe. As published on 17 June 2025, Talkpool has launched a new Swedish subsidiary initiative to deliver advanced communication solutions for the defense sector in Sweden. Important events after the 1st of July 2025 There have been no major events after the reporting period. In August 2025, the management decided to launch a search-and-grow initiative for the next generation of managers. This management development program spans the areas of sales, finance, operations and general business. Selected staff in Talkpool’s markets will be supported and monitored with the purpose of step-by-step strengthening the management’s performance over the coming years.

Solid H1 2025 Performance The Group delivered a solid performance in the first half of 2025, maintaining momentum in Q2. Volumes increased organically by 4% to 8.8m hectoliters in H1 2025, driven by growth in the Western Europe and International segments. Northern Europe saw a slight decline, primarily due to cold weather in Finland during Q2. However, good July weather in Finland closed part of volume shortfall caused by the weather in Q2. Operating in a consumer environment that remains challenging, but broadly unchanged from 2024, Royal Unibrew is estimated to have gained market share across most markets. Net revenue reached DKK 7,644m, up 3% organically from H1 2024, with no material changes in price/mix. Organic growth was primarily driven by our new activities in Belgium and Luxemburg (BeLux), following the start of the PepsiCo partnership on October 1, 2024. BeLux contributed approximately 3.5% to the Group’s volume growth and 2.5% to net revenue growth in H1 and Q2 2025. EBIT grew organically by 9% to DKK 959m, with the EBIT margin expanding by 80 basis points to 12.5%, reflecting our ongoing efficiency initiatives. The positive margin development was achieved despite increased investments in marketing activities during the period. In the first half of 2025 Royal Unibrew continued to make progress on the ESG agenda, delivering tangible results across key focus areas, with reduced Co2 intensity in production and improved safety performance as notable achievements. Q2 2025 Highlights Organic volume growth accelerated to 7%, reaching 5.1m hectoliters. The higher growth rate in Q2 was primarily driven by the timing of Easter, which fell in Q2 in 2025 and shifted some sales from Q1. Additionally, a strike in Finland contributed to this shift, further moving sales from Q1 to Q2. Underlying market trends remained largely unchanged between the quarters . Net revenue rose organically by 5% to DKK 4,438m in the quarter. Approximately 2.5% of the growth was attributable to the new BeLux activities. EBIT increased organically by 11% to DKK 740m in Q2 2025, with a margin expansion of 100 basis points to 16.7%. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Free cash flow for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 458m, compared to DKK 560m in H1 2024. The development was in line with our plans, supported by higher net profit for the period, but offset by higher capex. Net working capital was reduced by DKK 81m compared to the same time last year, and we expect a positive impact on cash flow from net working capital for the full year. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) stood at DKK 6,374m at the end of H1 2025, up from DKK 5,848m at the end of H1 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to the dividend payment in Q2 2025, whereas in 2024, the dividend was postponed to the fourth quarter. Furthermore, NIBD was impacted by higher capex and the ongoing share buy-back program. The 12-month NIBD/EBITDA ratio was 2.3 at the end of H1 2025 in line with our target level. Share buy-back Program A separate announcement about the launch of a new share buy-back program of up to DKK 300m is issued today. The program will be concluded no later than December 19, 2025. Updated Financial Outlook for full-year 2025 Based on our performance in the first half of 2025 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing the ranges the full-year financial outlook as follows Net revenue growth is now expected in the range of 5-6% (previously 5-7%) EBIT growth is expected in the range of 8-12% (was 7-13%) These adjustments reflect broadly normal summer weather conditions across our markets, resulting in no additional impact on activity levels. Additionally, revenue has been affected by a reduction in private label production and adverse foreign exchange developments. The consumer environment remains challenging but stable compared to 2024, and our assumptions in this area remain unchanged. Other assumptions for guidance are unchanged: Net financial expenses, excluding currency related losses or gains, of around DKK 250m (2024: DKK 301m) Effective tax rate of around 22% (2024: 21.5%) Capex in the range around 7% revenue (2024: 6%) Conference Call Investors and analysts can register for a conference call on August 27, 2025, at 09:00 am CEST at the following links: Webcast: Telephone: For Further Information on This Announcement: Media and Investor Relations: Flemming Ole Nielsen, +45 25 41 68 04, Forward-looking statements This interim report contains forward-looking statements, including statements about the Group’s sales, revenue, earnings, spending, margins, cash flows, inventories, products, actions, plans, strategies, objectives and guidance with respect to the Group’s future operating results.

Second quarter 2025 Revenue SEK 43.7 million (49.8) EBITDA SEK 1.4 million (-6.6) Adjusted EBITDA SEK -0.4 million (-1.1) Operational EBIT (1) SEK -1.2 million (-9.4) EBIT SEK -57.3 million (-41.6) Result after tax (2) SEK -46.5 million (-2.1) Cash flow from operating activities SEK -1.2 million (-6.0) Diluted earnings per share (3) SEK -6.27 (-9.83) First six months 2025 Revenue SEK 86.0 million (102.3) EBITDA SEK 2.1 million (-1.5) Adjusted EBITDA SEK 0.2 million (4.0) Operational EBIT (1) SEK -3.5 million (-7.0) EBIT SEK -75.1 million (-80.9) Result after tax (2) SEK -64.0 million (-62.6) Cash flow from operating activities SEK 0.9 million (-3.4) Diluted earnings per share (3) SEK -8.60 (-286.56) 1) Operational EBIT is defined as EBIT excluding non-operational amortisation and impairment of intangible assets 2) In the Group’s earnings for the quarter, SEK -29.7 million relates to the sale of subsidiaries Lucky Kat and Wagmi. 3) Per number of shares at the end of the period CEO Stefan Tengvall comments Revenue amounted to SEK 43.7 (49.8) million, a decline of SEK 6.1 million compared with 2024, partly due to currency effects and partly due to lower revenue in the Esports and Gaming business areas. The quarter was mainly affected by Playdigious having few game releases. However, the releases later in the summer have shown a very strong performance. EBITDA continues to reflect the cost reductions carried out during 2024 and the Company’s ability to subsequently maintain lower cost levels, particularly in the Parent Company. Subnautica – milestone for Playdigious Subnautica was finally released in July. After several postponements of the release over the course of a long period, we are delighted to have both announced and seen the effects of Playdigious’ most significant ported IP to date. The successful release resulted in high rankings on Google and Apple, high player ratings and a satisfied IP owner. The game’s revenue contributed to a strong result for Playdigious in July, and the title is expected to continue generating good results going forward. The second quarter as a whole was financially weak for Playdigious, as major titles did not reach the market until the third quarter. Fretless, which was also successfully released in July, had been pushed back from May, which had a significant negative impact on the second quarter. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge was released on Apple and Google in April and Crown Gambit for PC was released in June. Crown Gambit has not met expectations during its initial post-release period and Playdigious is working on new marketing activities to address this. Looking ahead, the next game will be the mobile version of Chants of Sennaar, releasing this week. Popular title Don’t Starve Together is in the pipeline and is one of the IPs in which the subsidiary has most confidence over the long term. In addition, two not yet announced mobile titles are scheduled for release in the fourth quarter, and after receiving approval in China, Playdigious is in dialogue with its publishing partner to finalise the release date for Spiritfarer on the Chinese market. Work is in progress to further increase the portfolio’s exposure in China. FunRock Prey expands Since early 2024, FunRock Prey has successfully delivered a turnaround and achieved profitability in both proprietary game development and the hybrid work-for-hire (WFH) vertical. The subsidiary reported a stable quarter with revenue slightly above forecast and is well on the way to achieving updated financial targets for the full year 2025, including a forecast EBITDA of SEK 4 million compared with SEK 0.6 million for the full year 2024. Growth is mainly driven by hybrid WFH, which recently reached a milestone with the release of the first white-label game, for which FunRock Prey is entitled to revenue share – an additional upside if the title performs well. Expansion and rebranding of the business vertical is ongoing. Since the start of the year, the establishment of hybrid WFH has also enabled the subsidiary to allocate time in periods to the development of a new mobile game, and we hope to present the concept in connection with the next interim report. New esports IP but challenges for Config During the period, the Swedish CS League (sv: Svenska CS-ligan) was introduced – a new IP with an inaugural tournament that was both profitable and well received by viewers. The tournament also served as the Swedish qualifier for Elisa Nordic Championship 2025. However, the quarter was very weak for the Esports business area, mainly due to Config generating lower revenue than expected, driven by a significantly subdued consultancy market. In March, the Config Ads business vertical was launched – an advertising network focused on gaming and esports. To date, the business has only been run at test level as third-party technical integration has unfortunately been delayed. The subsidiary expects to roll out full operations towards the end of the year. In the near term, we look forward to the start of the qualifiers for this year’s edition of Sweden’s largest esports tournament the Swedish Cup. Sale of Lucky Kat and Wagmi On 31 May, the Company signed an agreement to sell all its remaining shares in subsidiaries Lucky Kat and Wagmi. The decision to divest was difficult and made with a heavy heart, particularly with regard to the Lucky Kat employees who have delivered with commitment and on a high, professional level over a long period of time. I would like to extend my personal gratitude to them. The sale was prompted by the negative financial trend that had persisted since the beginning of 2024, the subsidiaries’ repeated inability to meet their own forecasts, operational leadership that did not meet expectations and the significant strain that the negative cash flow placed on the Group as a whole. Given Fragbite Group’s decentralised governance model, the Board concluded there was insufficient time to step in and establish a new organisation and capitalise on all the subsidiaries’ assets – IPs, digital assets, structural capital and expertise – without draining the other subsidiaries too much. In this situation, the sale was the best solution for the Group. The agreement includes revenue-sharing from the hyper-casual portfolio for 30 months, which fits well with Fragbite Group’s strategy of an IP-centric business. We hope that Lucky Kat and Wagmi will continue operations, and realise the potential of their assets, and that these IPs will continue to generate revenue for the Group over time. Bitcoin Treasury – charting new paths forward On 30 June, Fragbite Group established the Bitcoin Treasury business area, which has had a flying start and gotten a very positive response. The new business area enables surpluses to be invested in Bitcoin with the aim of building a strong capital structure, while also opening up new financing opportunities. Bitcoin Treasury has raised SEK 11 million in seed liquidity through favourable convertible loans, and the Bitcoin holding is growing. The decision to introduce Bitcoin on the balance sheet is based on the Company’s conviction in its potential as a long-term store of value and strategic asset for Fragbite Group’s growth. Increasing shareholder value using Bitcoin as leverage is a long-term strategy, and we see an opportunity here to be at the forefront in the Nordic region with active Bitcoin investment alongside continued development of our core operations in gaming and esports. We know our shareholders are already familiar with blockchain-based digital assets and modern financial structures, making this a natural next step for Fragbite Group. The Company is now working towards closing 2025 with 100 bitcoin on the balance sheet, which has been adopted as a financial target. Strategic review and focus on profitability The strategic review initiated in conjunction with the sale of Lucky Kat and Wagmi is ongoing. We have made solid progress in terms of restructuring and finding solutions to reduce the debt level and close 2025 with profitability across the entire Group. We look forward to establishing a new, clear and competitive strategic platform this fall and sharing it with our shareholders.

The annual total payment volume is expected to amount to SEK 20 billion once all the new agreements are live (>+40% compared with LTM). Income in the quarter benefited from growth in the SME segment. At the same time income has been impacted by several factors, subduing the overall picture of an otherwise operationally strong quarter with accelerating growth in total payment volume of 37%. The total payment volume increased by 37% to SEK 4.1 billion in the quarter. After three consecutive quarters of negative growth the BNPL volume showed signs of stabilising in Q2 (+1%). In addition the BNPL share increased in July, at the same time as the BNPL volume rose by 9%. Both BNPL share and volume improved in July by +9%. Nevertheless, the BNPL volume is lower than previously expected, which means we expect the forecast income growth to be delayed and realised towards the end of the year. We currently estimate that operating income growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 will be around 15 per cent. Growth is subsequently expected to accelerate into 2026 as income gradually catches up with volume.” Presentation of the Interim Report Today, August 26, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. CEO Christoffer Rutgersson and CFO Carl Löfgren will present the Interim Report for Q2 2025.

Compared to Q2 2024, sales increased by just over 50 percent and operating profit (EBIT) improved by approximately SEK 5 million. The trend of the gaming industry continues to be towards cost efficiency and outsourcing, and during the second quarter Envar’s focus remained on developing existing customer relationships and raising the Company's profile. This is reflected in the robust sales recorded, of around SEK 24.4 million in Q2, compared to around SEK 16.2 million in Q2 2024. SECOND QUARTER│APRIL–JUNE 2025 Net sales amounted to SEK 24,368 thousand (16,164), an increase of 50,75 percent compared to the same period last year Operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) totaled SEK 6,222 thousand (1,182), representing an operating margin of 25.53 percent (7,31) before depreciation. Operating profit (EBIT) totaled SEK 6,045 thousand (978) representing an operating margin of 24.81 percent (6.05). Earnings per share, basic, amounted to SEK 0.38 (1,692.12). A 20,000-for-1 share split and a quota value issue of 2,500,000 shares were registered in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 54,324 thousand (3,062). Cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 7,475 thousand (1,119). Net cash totaled SEK 54,324 thousand. The Company has no interest-bearing liabilities. (Figures for comparison in parentheses refer to the corresponding period of the previous year). ACCUMULATED │JANUARY – JUNE Net sales amounted to SEK 47,044 thousand (27,229), an increase of 72.77 percent compared to the same period last year. Operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) totaled SEK 11,283 thousand (-2,243), representing an operating margin of 23.98 percent (-8.24) before depreciation. Operating profit (EBIT) totaled SEK 10,928 thousand (-2,651), representing an operating margin of 23.23 percent (-9.74). Earnings per share, basic, amounted to SEK 0.65 (-5,474.93). A 20,000-for-1 share split and a quota value issue of 2,500,000 shares were registered in the fourth quarter of 2024. Cash and cash equivalents totaled SEK 54,324 thousand (3,062). Cash flow from operating activities amounted to SEK 2,922 thousand (971). Net cash totaled SEK 54,324 thousand. The Company has no interest-bearing liabilities. (Figures for comparison in parentheses refer to the corresponding period of the previous year). SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER In April, the Board of Directors of Envar Holding AB decided that Swedish and English would be established as the Company’s languages of communication, starting with publication of the interim report for the first quarter of 2025. In the event of any differences in language versions, the Swedish version is authoritative. In early May, Envar announced a major order from a leading game developer in the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) category. The order is valued at approximately SEK 7.3 million and the counterparty has been a customer of Envar since 2020. Envar Holding's Annual General Meeting was held on May 27, attended by approximately 80 percent of the shareholders in the Company. The meeting resolved, among other things, to appoint Grant Thornton Sweden AB as the Company’s auditor, with John Liljenfeldt as Key Audit Partner. The meeting also resolved that regular Board member Pernilla Jennesäter would depart from the Board of Directors. In June, Envar's first CEO letter was presented to the market. The Company's CEO letter is intended to better inform market about Envar, to increase awareness of developments in Envar's business areas and to supplement the quarterly reports. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE QUARTER In July, Envar Holding AB announced an update of the financial calendar for 2025/2026 published earlier. The background to this is that Envar's financial monitoring has been streamlined, making it possible to bring forward the quarterly reporting to the market as of the Q3 report in 2025. In July, Envar Holding AB published a “reverse” profit warning as a result of a materially higher operating profit (EBIT). The reason for the announcement was a preliminary positive EBIT of SEK 6,045 thousand, an increase of 518.10 percent compared to Q2 2024 and of 23.80 percent compared to Q1 2025. Certified Adviser Envar has appointed Amudova as the Company's Certified Adviser on Nasdaq First North Growth Market.

The trend of the gaming industry continues to be towards cost efficiency and outsourcing, and during the second quarter Envar’s focus remained on developing existing customer relationships and raising the Company's profile.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER In April, the Board of Directors of Envar Holding AB decided that Swedish and English would be established as the Company’s languages of communication, starting with publication of the interim report for the first quarter of 2025. In the event of any differences in language versions, the Swedish version is authoritative. In early May, Envar announced a major order from a leading game developer in the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) category. The order is valued at approximately SEK 7.3 million and the counterparty has been a customer of Envar since 2020. Envar Holding's Annual General Meeting was held on May 27, attended by approximately 80 percent of the shareholders in the Company. The meeting resolved, among other things, to appoint Grant Thornton Sweden AB as the Company’s auditor, with John Liljenfeldt as Key Audit Partner. The meeting also resolved that regular Board member Pernilla Jennesäter would depart from the Board of Directors. In June, Envar's first CEO letter was presented to the market. The Company's CEO letter is intended to better inform market about Envar, to increase awareness of developments in Envar's business areas and to supplement the quarterly reports. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE QUARTER In July, Envar Holding AB announced an update of the financial calendar for 2025/2026 published earlier. The background to this is that Envar's financial monitoring has been streamlined, making it possible to bring forward the quarterly reporting to the market as of the Q3 report in 2025. In July, Envar Holding AB published a “reverse” profit warning as a result of a materially higher operating profit (EBIT). The reason for the announcement was a preliminary positive EBIT of SEK 6,045 thousand, an increase of 518.10 percent compared to Q2 2024 and of 23.80 percent compared to Q1 2025.

Adjusted for significant negative currency effects from the USD and EUR, underlying growth was a solid 12% in the quarter. Gross profit amounted to SEK 82.8 (81.0) million, equivalent to the corresponding period of the previous year. Gross margin amounted to 90% (90%). EBITDA improved to SEK 1.0 (-23.2) million.

Operating result amounted to SEK -40.6 (-64.2) million, whereas the amortization of the surplus value, regarding acquisition of Affectiva and iMotions, amounted to SEK -26.5 (-29.2) million. Earnings after tax per share were -1.00 (-1.46), and after full dilution -1.00 (-1.46). Cash and cash equivalents totals SEK 11.8 million at the end of June. The available cash ending balance, including unutilized credit facilities, amounted to SEK 93.8 million. January – June 2025 Net sales amounted to SEK 182.2 (175.7) million, an increase of 3.7% compared to the corresponding period the previous year. Growth excluding exchange rates effects in the six- month period amounted to 8.2%. Gross profit amounted to SEK 162.7 (158.3) million, an improvement of SEK 4.4 million compared to last year. Gross margin amounted to 89% (90%). EBITDA improved to SEK -16.9 (-46.2) million. Excluding FX effects and one-time items in the first quarter, underlying EBITDA has improved significantly during this period.

Result after financial items amounted to SEK -109.3 (-124.9) million. Earnings after tax per share were -2.47 (-2.99), and after full dilution -2.47 (-2.99). Comments from the CEO Quarter two came in almost precisely according to our planned base case, with organic growth coming in at a solid 12%. One thing deviated slightly, namely the strengthening of the Swedish krona which affected us more than anticipated. It decreased both topline and Opex, with net effect being positive EBITDA for the first time in a long while, +1 MSEK. Without FX effects our comparable EBITDA came in at +7 MSEK. Our target for cost savings was achieved with some margin, and we anticipate continued low operational expenses in the third quarter. Together with steady acceleration of the license revenues, quarter three is expected to become even stronger, as per our previous communication. Automotive The main takeaway in Q2 was the acceleration of the OEM production programs, as was observed by the surge in license revenue. This is the well-earned reward for many years of hard work, first to secure the contracts and then to deliver the production-ready software. It’s incredibly satisfying to see the number of manufactured cars increase from all geographic markets. Japan, Korea, China, Europe and US, all of them are finally rolling out, with license growth substantially above 100%. A total of 90 models has entered production with 12 OEMs, and we expect that number to continue to increase rapidly. As the non-license revenue decreased, it resulted in 42% organic growth for the whole business unit. We are in the race for several large ongoing procurements, and as usual we are standing strong thanks to the industry’s by far most complete product portfolio combined with our solid reputation as a high quality, trustworthy and dependable supplier. The fact that we have successfully turned around the company financially is positive. It helps us by decreasing the risk and comforting our present and future customers, the world’s largest OEMs. There is continued consolidation going on in the interior sensing industry and two competitors have merged with larger companies during the period, driven by the need for economies of scale, only available for a select few market players including Smart Eye. Behavioral Research We came in slightly below target, mainly because of FX and continued headwinds in the US. Other markets have been delivering as expected. We landed in the end with organic growth of -1% for the business area. However, looking at the whole market, we performed better than industry peers, meaning that we likely are increasing our market share. We have seen some positive signs during the summer, so we expect a strong second half of the year, particularly a solid fourth quarter supported by seasonal effects. The business area is both profitable and cash flow positive at current levels. Final Words During the spring we recognized that our cost-saving initiatives, combined with license volumes ramp-up, might be enough for positive EBITDA as early as Q2 – and by a narrow margin we succeeded. It opens the door for alternative and more attractive financing options, since it makes us eligible for regular bank credit, should it be needed or wanted. We expect the coming quarters to be continuously stronger as our customers roll out their car programs. We ended the quarter with 94 MSEK in cash and credit facilities, which we consider sufficient given the strong outlook in the coming quarters. No further cost-saving measures are planned at this stage. Martin Krantz CEO Smart Eye Find the full report and all previous financial reports at .

The interim report is attached to this announcement and will be available on the company’s website. Q2 Highlights Record Last Twelve Months (LTM) performance in the history of Shape Robotics, including revenue of DKK 325.5m, EBITDA of DKK 50.8m, and positive net result of DKK 13.5m. Reported revenue in Q2 2025 decreased to DKK 60.0m (Q2 2024: DKK 71.2m), corresponding to decrease of 16% (H1 2025: increase of 22% to DKK 129.7m), in relation to the company's goal of focusing on profitability. Contribution margin increased to 52% in Q2 2025, up from 25% in Q2 2024. EBITDA amounted to DKK 13.7m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK -2.2m). Net working capital amounted to DKK 313.4m as of June 30, 2025 (DKK 87.6m as of June 30, 2024). Increase in net working capital is caused mainly by building the readiness in inventories for ambitious sales projects in H2 2025 and reflects the ability to support expected revenue growth in 2025. Liabilities amounted to DKK 464.8m as of June 30, 2025 (DKK 175.0m as of June 30, 2024) following the financing agreement with UniCredit in support of company growth.

Improved cash flow and solid performance in Europe First quarter summary Despite a slight decline in orders during the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remains above 1, reflecting a healthy business environment. Net sales at constant exchange rates grew by 3 percent, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe, where our latest linear accelerator, Elekta Evo, and our new software suite, Elekta ONE, are gaining traction as online adaptive treatment capabilities continue to set new benchmarks in the market. The adjusted gross margin in Q1 was impacted by normal seasonality and continued negative FX effects, resulting in a year-over-year decrease to 37.0 percent (37.8). In addition, this quarter had a negative impact from tariffs of SEK 33 M, which weighed on the margin performance by 90 bps. The negative impact was partly offset by price improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin for the first quarter came in at 6.5 percent, compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher amortization and lower capitalization, although this was partly offset by reduced selling and administrative expenses, reflecting the effect from our continued cost-saving initiatives. Operating cash flow after continuous investments improved by SEK 529 million, reaching SEK -361 million in the first quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by improved working capital management. Investor update On June 10, we held an Investor Update with the purpose of providing an update of our progress across several key projects as well as presenting the strong fundamentals of the radiation therapy industry. We reiterated the roadmap to achieve our mid-term financial objectives. This includes restoring the gross margin to pre-pandemic levels and reaching an EBIT margin of at least 14 percent. Key drivers are growing volumes, enhanced pricing supported by new product launches, an improved product mix, and accelerated expansion in mature markets. As part of our commitment to operational excellence, we also presented the result of a proactive order review aimed at increasing the quality of the backlog to improve profitability and predictability. Commercial milestones During the quarter, we delivered several important commercial wins with Elekta Evo and our software suite Elekta ONE. For example, we concluded a comprehensive deal including some of our most advanced solutions to the University of Texas Southwestern. Leksell Gamma Knife received FDA 510(k) clearance for treating a certain type of epilepsy, which is an important step towards expanding the scope of radiosurgery. We have also noted that the ERECT trial, demonstrating Elekta Unity’s capability to treat prostate cancer while preserving erectile function, has gained significant attention. Outlook We expect net sales for Q2 to be negatively impacted by a continued weak US development as well as a negative effect from last year's low order intake in China. However, we expect sales in China to start to recover during the second half of 2025/26. Furthermore, we expect a continuous negative impact on earnings from FX at current exchange rates and from tariffs in Q2. We reiterate our full year 2025/26 outlook, where we expect net sales in constant currency to grow year-over-year. I would like to end my CEO comment by welcoming Jakob Just-Bomholt as Elekta’s new CEO. Jakob is a highly experienced international executive with a successful career and CEO positions in various global industries, including the medtech sector.

We are also seeing steady progress in our Healthcare segment, where RTX products remain critical components in advanced patient monitoring systems. Although short order cycles continue to limit forecast visibility, demand patterns across quarters are becoming more stable. We are increasing our efforts to follow ongoing market dynamics and trends, in order to better align with customer expectations and evolving market demands. At the end of June, we raised our full-year guidance, as strong Q3 result became evident and several orders for Q4 were secured. U.S. tariffs continue to create uncertainty, and we are working closely with our large international customers to find the best solutions. With strong expertise and a global customer base, the Company has a solid foundation. By expanding our footprint and focusing on strategic priorities, we are reinforcing our ability to drive sustainable growth and long-term value .” Henrik Mørck Mogensen, CEO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue for Q3 2024/25 increased by 3.5% year on year to 146.9 DKKm, compared to 141.9 DKKm in Q3 2023/24. Adjusted for currency effects, revenue for the quarter increased by 9.9%. For the first nine months of 2024/25, revenue rose by 16.7% year on year to 407.3 DKKm, and by 18.0% when adjusted for currency effects. Gross margin reached 51.7% for Q3 2024/25, and 50.7% for the first 9M 2024/25. Gross margin improved due to a favourable product mix and higher revenue from the Healthcare segment. EBITDA reached 15.0 DKKm for Q3 2024/25, and 22.2 DKKm for 9M 2024/25 (Q3 2023/24: 9.4 DKKm, 9M: -20.1 DKKm). GUIDANCE On 23 June 2025, RTX adjusted the guidance for 2024/25, and with the announcement of this interim report the intervals are narrowed by raising the lower range of EBITDA and EBIT by 10 DKKm: Revenue DKK 530 to 560 million (from DKK 490 to 530 million) EBITDA DKK 25 to 35 million (from DKK 0 to 20 million) EBIT DKK -5 to 5 million (from DKK -35 to -15 million) BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Continued strong performance in Enterprise segment driven mainly by customers in the retail sector and long-term customers demand across applications. The Healthcare segment delivered solid revenue growth, driven by sales of RTX products used in patient monitoring systems. While the order horizon remains short and creates uncertainty in our forecast, we see more stable and even demand patterns between quarters. Reduction in inventory from 74.1 DKKm in Q2 to 56.5 DKKm in Q3, mainly due to reduction in component inventory. Increase in guidance for the financial year 2024/25 was communicated on 23 June 2025.

The training business operations sold in the first half of 2024 and the subsidiary Wetteri Power Oy, sold at the beginning of 2025, are presented as discontinued operations in the interim report. Correspondingly, the income statement items of the discontinued operations are presented in the consolidated income statement for the financial year as part of the profit (loss) of the Group’s discontinued operations, separately from the income statement items of the Group’s continuing operations. 2 The adjusted EBITDA and operating profit do not take items affecting the comparability of the Group’s EBITDA and operating profit into account, such as significant non-recurring items of income and expenses, and amortisation of the fair value of assets recognised on the balance sheet by means of acquisition calculations. The purpose of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is to improve the comparability of the Group’s EBITDA and operating profit between periods. The reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is presented on page 18 of the interim report. CEO Pietu Parikka’s review “The car market continued to be challenging in the second quarter of 2025. During April–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s con-tinuing operations were EUR 109.0 million (117.3 million), adjusted EBITDA was EUR 2.3 million (2.8 million), and the adjust-ed operating profit was a loss of EUR -1.4 million (-0.7 million). Wetteri’s revenue of continuing operations for January–June was EUR 224.5 (244.1) million, its adjusted EBITDA was EUR 4.6 (6.7) million, and its adjusted operating result was EUR -2.8 (0.1) million. The loss for the period before taxes for continuing operations was EUR -8.8 (-8.3) million. Profitability was bur-dened by subdued market demand and the resulting price competition, low sales efficiency and weak working capital turno-ver. In January–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s Passenger Cars segment decreased by 13% year-on-year and amounted to EUR 162.5 million. The adjusted operating profit of the Passenger Cars segment showed a loss, amounting to EUR -4.1 million. The number of new car orders during January-June was 2,100 units, which is 11.7 percent more than in the corresponding period of the previous year. An increase in order volumes was seen toward the end of the review period. In January–June, Wetteri’s invoiced sales of new cars totalled 1,989 (1,994) units, which was in line with the previous year’s figures. Order and invoicing volumes were influenced, among other things, by new car brand representations. In line with our strategy, we ex-panded our operations in early 2025 by opening a new full-service dealership in Lahti, featuring brand representation for Kia, Mitsubishi and Mazda. After the review period, we also announced the launch of Mercedes-Benz representation in Lahti, start-ing in August 2025. The new market area and strong brands provide a solid foundation for increasing sales potential in the Päijät-Häme economic region. Competition in the used car trade remained intense, while demand was subdued, which was reflected in car prices and slow inventory turnover. During the six-month reporting period, 4,200 (4,965) used cars were sold, and their invoicing decreased by 15.4% year-on-year. The inventory optimisation measures initiated in the first quarter continued into the second quarter, including efforts to improve working capital turnover. The impacts of these measures are expected to materialise during the second half of 2025, providing a strong foundation for a turnaround in the profitability of the used car business. Towards the end of the first half of the year, we began to see positive signs in the unit profitability of sold vehicles and in the development of sales of the Wetteri Turva additional service. The weak performance in car sales also had an impact on maintenance and repair shop operations. The revenue of the Maintenance Services segment in January–June was EUR 46.2 (49.3) million, and its adjusted operating profit was EUR 1.0 (2.4) million. The number of damage repairs decreased as a result of the mild winter. Due to the uneven distribution of demand, there were significant differences in profitability between locations. For example, the maintenance and damage repair workshops at our new locations in Lempäälä and Lahti were still in the start-up phase during the review period. Performance improvement measures will be planned for low-profitability locations during the remainder of the year. The revenue of the Heavy Equipment segment developed favourably during the review period and amounted to EUR 14.1 (7.1) million. During the review period, we discontinued the importing of SANY earth-moving machinery. In May, we launched a profitability program aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and unit margins, improving working capital turnover, and reducing capital tied up in operations as well as indebtedness. The measures will be fully reflected in the results during 2026. Wetteri’s financial position already improved in January–June 2025 thanks to the Wetteri Power transaction and profitability measures: interest-bearing debt decreased by a total of EUR 24.8 million, and our equity ratio improved to 20 percent. During the review period, we made preparations for the sale of our heavy equipment maintenance and spare parts operations in Joensuu and Kajaani. The transaction was signed on 7 July 2025 and will be completed during the second half of 2025. The transaction further strengthens Wetteri’s self-sufficiency and creates a foundation for further business development. I started as the CEO of Wetteri at the beginning of August, after which we also renewed the composition of the management team. In the current challenging market situation, we continue to improve profitability and focus on enhancing efficiency. The strategy update process is also progressing, and we will publish our updated strategy in the second half of 2025. Due to the company’s financial situation and weaker-than-expected market development, we initiated change negotiations on 27 August 2025. The negotiations concern the personnel of Wetteri Yhtiöt Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, excluding mechanics. The aim is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the goal is to harmonize job descriptions and align organizational structures. If implemented, the measures may result in certain positions being discontinued or reorganized. Towards the end of the review period, cautious signs of a pick-up in car sales began to emerge in the market. The used car market is stabilising, and the prices of used cars are beginning to level out. The sales of new cars also appear to be developing positively toward the end of the year, with an increase in demand for electric cars. Affordable new electric vehicle models are entering the market, lowering the average price of new cars and thereby reducing the threshold for customers to purchase a new car. We also believe that the new scrapping bonus campaign presented by the government will support the development of the market. During the remainder of the year, we will continue measures to achieve synergy benefits from acquisitions and improve profitability. Wetteri holds significant potential, and by harnessing this potential, we can take major steps forward in our development. By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025. Registrations of new cars fell short of the levels projected by the automotive forecasting group. Based on the growth outlook for the automotive sector, an increase of around 10% was projected for 2025 at the end of 2024. However, in January–June 2025, registrations of new passenger cars were 4.9% lower than in the corresponding period in the previous year. In the used car trade, the unit price level has been low, but the market is now stabilising and showing signs of percentage growth. In April, Wetteri launched a profitability programme aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability. The full impact of the programme is expected to materialise during 2026. In August 2025, the company initiated change negotiations due to its financial situation and weaker-than-expected market demand. The objective of the negotiations is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of EUR 4 million. In May, Wetteri withdrew its guidance for 2025 due to increased market uncertainty. The company will review the possibility of issuing new guidance once the strategy work has been completed.

Structural investments in Narva (Estonia), Holic (Slovakia) and Gliwice (Poland) were completed, and operations were started. The start-up and ramp-up phase of the Gliwice investment is impacting profitability negatively in 2025. On 23 May 2025, Fortaco Oy, a subsidiary of Fortaco Group Holdco Plc, signed an agreement on the sale of its Serbian subsidiary and its marine and energy business in Gruza, Serbia, to Entec Evotec AS. The transaction was completed on 11 June 2025. Fortaco completed the reorganisation of its financing, including the extension of the maturity of the bond debt by two years, EUR 20 million of new equity to further strengthen the balance sheet and the liquidity position, other favourable amendments to the terms and conditions of the bond contributing to cash-flow improvements in 2025 and 2026 as well as extending the maturity of the EUR 7.5 million super senior revolving credit facility by two years.

President & CEO Mika Mahlberg’s comments In the second quarter of 2025, the market situation remained challenging. As expected, our comparable revenue for the quarter was below the level of the comparison period and amounted to EUR 88.4 million (92.0). However, our comparable order intake increased by approximately 7 per cent compared with the second quarter of last year and by 6 per cent from the first quarter of this year. Operational profitability declined from the comparison period. Our comparable EBITDA, excluding items affecting comparability, was EUR 4.7 million (7.1), representing 5.3 (7.7) per cent of revenue. The result was significantly burdened by the ongoing ramp-up measures at the Gliwice unit in Poland, the costs of which will continue to impact profitability during the remainder of the year. The turnaround process at the Breitenau, Austria business unit, which is progressing as planned, also continued to affect the result. Although comparable revenue and EBITDA remained below the level of the comparison period, the gap was smaller than in the first quarter of the year, and we take a cautiously positive view of the remainder of the year. We are increasing production capacity at several plants to meet customer demand. Sales development is encouraging, and we see new, tangible opportunities in the market related to the long-term outsourcing trend. We have lately secured several new customers, which are currently ramping up. Fortaco is committed to delivering the highest quality, reliability of supply and flexibility in its industry, thereby supporting its customers’ profitable growth across different market cycles. We believe these factors will become increasingly important as volumes return to growth. Fortaco’s performance improvement programme, Fortaco 25, had a positive impact on second-quarter profitability and partly offset the cost effects of the ramp-up operations in Gliwice. The programme is progressing according to plan, and we are pleased with the positive impacts it has delivered on both result and cash flow. We will continue to focus on improving the profitability of our core business and strengthening our cash flow. Positive market signals, but US tariff policy creates uncertainty Despite the positive signs observed in some of Fortaco’s customer segments, the market does not yet show signs of broad-based recovery, although conditions in the mining and defence equipment industries remain favourable. United States trade policy continues to create significant uncertainty and reduces the predictability of market developments. At present, US tariffs have no material direct impact on Fortaco’s business, as both direct and indirect exports to the United States are limited and the business is primarily focused on Europe. Our balance sheet strengthened significantly Our balance sheet and liquidity strengthened significantly in May, when the company’s principal shareholder made an equity investment of EUR 20 million in the company, and amendments were made to the terms and conditions of our bond to strengthen cash flow. As a result of these measures, we are well positioned to implement our strategy and grow together with our customers when market conditions improve. In June, we sold our Serbian subsidiary and the business unit located in Gruza, which focused on the marine and energy industries, to the Norwegian Entec Evotec AS. The sale of the Gruza business unit was the final step in the strategic review of the company’s marine, energy and heavy project businesses, which has now been completed. The sale of the subsidiary will have no material impact on Fortaco’s revenue or profit this year. Developing our climate targets and sustainability reporting In the first half of 2025, we advanced key elements of our sustainability agenda. A project was launched to define science-based climate targets and outline our transition plans. We also explored ways to improve product-level emission calculations and identified further opportunities to decarbonise our Scope 1–3 emissions. We follow closely the development of EU regulations and the Omnibus proposal. We have gathered stakeholder feedback, benchmarking data, and insights to develop our reporting and processes further. We also integrated material sustainability topics more deeply into our business processes, reinforcing our commitment to long-term value creation and climate resilience. Fortaco’s personnel have done excellent work to improve our profitability and to meet the needs of our customers, and I would like to thank all Fortaco employees for their strong commitment.

The start-up and ramp-up phase of the Gliwice investment is impacting profitability negatively in 2025. On 23 May 2025, Fortaco Oy, a subsidiary of Fortaco Group Holdco Plc, signed an agreement on the sale of its Serbian subsidiary and its marine and energy business in Gruza, Serbia, to Entec Evotec AS.

On an LTM basis (excluding divested businesses), net sales is estimated to be in a range of EUR 323–338 million for Q3/2025. Net sales of the comparison period has been specified to be EUR 332 million (previously EUR 338 million) due to the divestment of the marine and energy business in Gruza. President & CEO Mika Mahlberg’s comments In the second quarter of 2025, the market situation remained challenging. As expected, our comparable revenue for the quarter was below the level of the comparison period and amounted to EUR 88.4 million (92.0). However, our comparable order intake increased by approximately 7 per cent compared with the second quarter of last year and by 6 per cent from the first quarter of this year. Operational profitability declined from the comparison period. Our comparable EBITDA, excluding items affecting comparability, was EUR 4.7 million (7.1), representing 5.3 (7.7) per cent of revenue. The result was significantly burdened by the ongoing ramp-up measures at the Gliwice unit in Poland, the costs of which will continue to impact profitability during the remainder of the year. The turnaround process at the Breitenau, Austria business unit, which is progressing as planned, also continued to affect the result. Although comparable revenue and EBITDA remained below the level of the comparison period, the gap was smaller than in the first quarter of the year, and we take a cautiously positive view of the remainder of the year. We are increasing production capacity at several plants to meet customer demand. Sales development is encouraging, and we see new, tangible opportunities in the market related to the long-term outsourcing trend. We have lately secured several new customers, which are currently ramping up. Fortaco is committed to delivering the highest quality, reliability of supply and flexibility in its industry, thereby supporting its customers’ profitable growth across different market cycles. We believe these factors will become increasingly important as volumes return to growth. Fortaco’s performance improvement programme, Fortaco 25, had a positive impact on second-quarter profitability and partly offset the cost effects of the ramp-up operations in Gliwice. The programme is progressing according to plan, and we are pleased with the positive impacts it has delivered on both result and cash flow. We will continue to focus on improving the profitability of our core business and strengthening our cash flow. Positive market signals, but US tariff policy creates uncertainty Despite the positive signs observed in some of Fortaco’s customer segments, the market does not yet show signs of broad-based recovery, although conditions in the mining and defence equipment industries remain favourable. United States trade policy continues to create significant uncertainty and reduces the predictability of market developments. At present, US tariffs have no material direct impact on Fortaco’s business, as both direct and indirect exports to the United States are limited and the business is primarily focused on Europe. Our balance sheet strengthened significantly Our balance sheet and liquidity strengthened significantly in May, when the company’s principal shareholder made an equity investment of EUR 20 million in the company, and amendments were made to the terms and conditions of our bond to strengthen cash flow. As a result of these measures, we are well positioned to implement our strategy and grow together with our customers when market conditions improve. In June, we sold our Serbian subsidiary and the business unit located in Gruza, which focused on the marine and energy industries, to the Norwegian Entec Evotec AS. The sale of the Gruza business unit was the final step in the strategic review of the company’s marine, energy and heavy project businesses, which has now been completed. The sale of the subsidiary will have no material impact on Fortaco’s revenue or profit this year. Developing our climate targets and sustainability reporting In the first half of 2025, we advanced key elements of our sustainability agenda. A project was launched to define science-based climate targets and outline our transition plans. We also explored ways to improve product-level emission calculations and identified further opportunities to decarbonise our Scope 1–3 emissions. We follow closely the development of EU regulations and the Omnibus proposal. We have gathered stakeholder feedback, benchmarking data, and insights to develop our reporting and processes further. We also integrated material sustainability topics more deeply into our business processes, reinforcing our commitment to long-term value creation and climate resilience. Fortaco’s personnel have done excellent work to improve our profitability and to meet the needs of our customers, and I would like to thank all Fortaco employees for their strong commitment. I also wish to thank our partners for their smooth cooperation, as well as our customers and principal shareholder for their continued trust.

Structural investments in Narva (Estonia), Holic (Slovakia) and Gliwice (Poland) were completed, and operations were started. The start-up and ramp-up phase of the Gliwice investment is impacting profitability negatively in 2025. On 23 May 2025, Fortaco Oy, a subsidiary of Fortaco Group Holdco Plc, signed an agreement on the sale of its Serbian subsidiary and its marine and energy business in Gruza, Serbia, to Entec Evotec AS. The transaction was completed on 11 June 2025. Fortaco completed the reorganisation of its financing, including the extension of the maturity of the bond debt by two years, EUR 20 million of new equity to further strengthen the balance sheet and the liquidity position, other favourable amendments to the terms and conditions of the bond contributing to cash-flow improvements in 2025 and 2026 as well as extending the maturity of the EUR 7.5 million super senior revolving credit facility by two years.

On an LTM basis (excluding divested businesses), net sales is estimated to be in a range of EUR 323–338 million for Q3/2025. Net sales of the comparison period has been specified to be EUR 332 million (previously EUR 338 million) due to the divestment of the marine and energy business in Gruza. President & CEO Mika Mahlberg’s comments In the second quarter of 2025, the market situation remained challenging. As expected, our comparable revenue for the quarter was below the level of the comparison period and amounted to EUR 88.4 million (92.0). However, our comparable order intake increased by approximately 7 per cent compared with the second quarter of last year and by 6 per cent from the first quarter of this year. Operational profitability declined from the comparison period. Our comparable EBITDA, excluding items affecting comparability, was EUR 4.7 million (7.1), representing 5.3 (7.7) per cent of revenue. The result was significantly burdened by the ongoing ramp-up measures at the Gliwice unit in Poland, the costs of which will continue to impact profitability during the remainder of the year. The turnaround process at the Breitenau, Austria business unit, which is progressing as planned, also continued to affect the result. Although comparable revenue and EBITDA remained below the level of the comparison period, the gap was smaller than in the first quarter of the year, and we take a cautiously positive view of the remainder of the year. We are increasing production capacity at several plants to meet customer demand. Sales development is encouraging, and we see new, tangible opportunities in the market related to the long-term outsourcing trend. We have lately secured several new customers, which are currently ramping up. Fortaco is committed to delivering the highest quality, reliability of supply and flexibility in its industry, thereby supporting its customers’ profitable growth across different market cycles. We believe these factors will become increasingly important as volumes return to growth. Fortaco’s performance improvement programme, Fortaco 25, had a positive impact on second-quarter profitability and partly offset the cost effects of the ramp-up operations in Gliwice. The programme is progressing according to plan, and we are pleased with the positive impacts it has delivered on both result and cash flow. We will continue to focus on improving the profitability of our core business and strengthening our cash flow. Positive market signals, but US tariff policy creates uncertainty Despite the positive signs observed in some of Fortaco’s customer segments, the market does not yet show signs of broad-based recovery, although conditions in the mining and defence equipment industries remain favourable. United States trade policy continues to create significant uncertainty and reduces the predictability of market developments. At present, US tariffs have no material direct impact on Fortaco’s business, as both direct and indirect exports to the United States are limited and the business is primarily focused on Europe. Our balance sheet strengthened significantly Our balance sheet and liquidity strengthened significantly in May, when the company’s principal shareholder made an equity investment of EUR 20 million in the company, and amendments were made to the terms and conditions of our bond to strengthen cash flow. As a result of these measures, we are well positioned to implement our strategy and grow together with our customers when market conditions improve. In June, we sold our Serbian subsidiary and the business unit located in Gruza, which focused on the marine and energy industries, to the Norwegian Entec Evotec AS. The sale of the Gruza business unit was the final step in the strategic review of the company’s marine, energy and heavy project businesses, which has now been completed. The sale of the subsidiary will have no material impact on Fortaco’s revenue or profit this year. Developing our climate targets and sustainability reporting In the first half of 2025, we advanced key elements of our sustainability agenda. A project was launched to define science-based climate targets and outline our transition plans. We also explored ways to improve product-level emission calculations and identified further opportunities to decarbonise our Scope 1–3 emissions. We follow closely the development of EU regulations and the Omnibus proposal. We have gathered stakeholder feedback, benchmarking data, and insights to develop our reporting and processes further. We also integrated material sustainability topics more deeply into our business processes, reinforcing our commitment to long-term value creation and climate resilience. Fortaco’s personnel have done excellent work to improve our profitability and to meet the needs of our customers, and I would like to thank all Fortaco employees for their strong commitment. I also wish to thank our partners for their smooth cooperation, as well as our customers and principal shareholder for their continued trust.

CEO's Comments on Q2 2025 Performance A solid quarter dominated by app store rulings and FX swings. We started Q2 with strong momentum in distribution, building on the success of Q1's new game launches. I am pleased to say that the new games are already contributing with more than USD 600k in revenue per month and supported our continued growth in the quarter. In USD terms, Distribution revenue was up 4% and Audiencly by 5% year-on-year. While our total reported revenue in GBP saw a 4% decline due to a weaker USD, this does not reflect our underlying performance. Audiencly's return to profitability in Q2 came on the back of a record number of clients served in Q1 with an average margin for the first half of the year at approximately 30%. Despite the typically slower summer period and a challenging market for games, we met our revenue guidance. Notably, our game portfolio and channels significantly outperformed its Google Play equivalents which experienced a 27% decline in the same period based on AppMagic figures, underscoring the clear shift towards alternative markets, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels. In Q2, we made progress on game launches and sourcing. We successfully signed ""Realms of Pixel"" and officially launched EA's ""Golf Clash."" We also secured another top 5 grossing game, yet to be fully launched. Looking ahead to Q3, our game portfolio now features 34 games and is expected to include four Top 10 grossing games (based on Google Play ranking). The average monthly revenue of our top tier games in Q2 was USD 700k. Having secured 4 out of 10 top grossing games is a major achievement for Flexion, making us uniquely attractive to existing and new distribution channels, as well as marketing and payment partners. This strategic advantage should help us maintain current momentum and secure more new deals into the autumn. I anticipate performance to pick up towards the end of Q3 once the summer period concludes, expecting revenue in the range of USD 21-24 million for the quarter. As highlighted in Q1, the amortization of our game distribution rights has significantly decreased, with our largest deal now fully amortized, leading to a closer alignment between our adjusted EBITDA and operating result. As our largest deal transitioned back to standard terms, our distribution gross margin declined as expected, reflecting the contractual shift in economics once our investment in the game was recouped. This outcome underscores both our commitment to bringing successful titles to alternative app stores and the underlying strength of these top-grossing games. Meanwhile, Audiencly’s gross margin improved, contributing to a consolidated company gross margin of 14%. I am also pleased to report that we have successfully extended and renewed several crucial developer agreements, providing greater revenue visibility over the next few years. We are in a strong financial position, with GBP 13.3 million in the bank and no debt, enabling us to continue strategic investments such as in our D2C initiatives. Total investment in product development so far this year is approximately GBP 0.4m. The alternative market continues to be shaped by pivotal legal decisions, with court rulings against Apple and Google in the US, alongside enforcement actions by the EU and other regulatory bodies in major mobile games markets. It is unequivocally clear that the long-standing ""walls"" of control on both iOS (Apple) and Android (Google Play) are coming down, and this shift is irreversible. This paradigm creates unprecedented new market opportunities for game developers and service providers. The growth of the mobile games market has long been constrained by Google and Apple's strict control. We firmly believe it is now poised to re-enter a period of growth, as increased developer freedoms, higher margins, and intensified competition will collectively drive significant investment and expansion in game marketing. For example, we are seeing increased capital investment activity in D2C payment and web store startups. For instance, Appcharge, a payments company we are working with, recently raised USD 58 million, bringing their total funding over the past nine months to USD 89 million. Besides continued investment in our SDK, our support for D2C includes integrations with Appcharge for in-app payments, alongside Xsolla and Coda Payments. On the product development side, we are also adding support for the Epic Games Store this year. Over the past 12 months, we have streamlined operations in Distribution, reducing headcount by 8% while improving overall efficiency. At the same time, we continue to invest in product development. Our teams recently returned from China Joy, Asia's largest game show and Gamescom in Europe, and the trend is clear: alternative stores are now firmly integrated into most game developers' user acquisition strategies, as return on ad spend (ROAS) can be higher due to more attractive payouts from these stores. This is a very important first step as the pace of change will depend heavily on paid user acquisition being funnelled through to new and high margin stores and D2C. We continue to develop expertise in user acquisition for the alternative markets and are seeing strong performance with certain games and channel combinations. For both existing and new stores, the ability to offer their services through Google Play thanks to the recent rulings will be tremendously beneficial, significantly reducing user friction and greatly assisting with user acquisition. We believe this will lead to an increased number of stores and empower developers to transform their web stores into powerful distribution channels over time. We are actively building for this open, competitive market, which represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity for developers. With our strong game and store partnerships, we are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalise on these emerging opportunities, and it is crucial that we continue to strategically invest in our robust service offering to remain at the forefront as the market transitions. I will continue to update you on our progress in these areas in Q3 and wish you a happy end to the summer season.

Revenue for H1 increased by 21%, while capacity costs (other external expenses and staff costs) in the same period increased by 14%, contributing to improvement in EBITDA and lower cash burn from operations. Impero maintains the updated outlook for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range, and EBITDA in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025). SaaS metrics and financial highlights on 30 June 2025 ARR increased by 15% to DKK 40.7M, from DKK 35.4M on 30 June 2024 Net ARR growth in H1-2025 amounted to DKK 2.0M, compared to DKK 5.0M in H1-2024 Uplift was 6% YoY, compared to 13% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Churn was 2%, YoY compared to 4% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Net Revenue Retention was 105% compared to 109% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Revenue for H1-2025 increased by 21% to DKK 20.1M, compared to the same period in 2024 EBITDA for H1-2025 was negative DKK 4.2M, compared to negative DKK 5.1M for the first half of 2024 During the first half of 2025, Impero welcomed 9 new customers across Germany, the UK, and Denmark. These organizations span industries including financial services, manufacturing, shipping, and IT services. By the end of H1 2025, Impero served 32% of the Danish C25 index and 20% of the German DAX 40 index, with the majority of the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) generated outside Denmark. While Q1 typically shows limited momentum due to customers’ fiscal year-end processes, Q2 is traditionally a stronger period. However, Q2 2025 fell short of expectations, with macroeconomic uncertainty where potential new customers seemed more cautious than usual. Despite this, we achieved gross ARR growth of DKK 3.5M in H1 2025. This was largely driven by significant upsell activity among existing customers, especially large enterprises in Germany’s automotive and manufacturing sectors, as well as customers in other markets who are expanding the use of Impero across their organizations. However, contractions impacted our net new ARR which ended at DKK 2M for the period. Due to continued focus on customer success and platform adoption, churn remained below 2% over the past 12 months. “While the first half of the year presented some challenges, we remain optimistic. Market potential is intact, and Impero is well positioned to continue our growth journey. We see strong demand for our intuitive, easy-to-implement platform that enables organizations to meet rising requirements for risk management and internal controls. With a remarkable customer base, an expanding partner network, a strengthened team, and enhanced product development, we are well equipped for the road ahead”, says CEO Rikke Stampe Skov. Partnerships to support growth Partnerships continue to be a strategic pillar in our efforts to help organizations navigate compliance challenges. We collaborate closely with experts in governance, risk, and compliance, particularly across tax and finance domains. These partnerships support efficient implementation of Impero and provide access to best practice templates developed by our partners. Of new ARR generated in H1 2025, 33% originated through the partner channel. As a result of ongoing investments in partner development, we saw greater engagement throughout H1 particularly in Germany, where we onboarded new partners and secured our first customers through two of these. We believe the partner channel will remain a key driver for growth. Enhancing platform value The first half of 2025 marked a significant step forward in our mission to simplify compliance through strengthening risk & internal control management for enterprise- and highly-regulated organizations. Guided by our strategic direction, we focus on delivering high-impact capabilities that expand our platform’s value, improve operational oversight, and support more efficient workflows. Following a successful beta period throughout H1 2025, we launched Control Testing into general availability in July 2025. This module introduces a structured, audit-friendly way to assess the effectiveness of internal controls empowering organizations to proactively identify weaknesses, refine processes, and strengthen overall compliance assurance. In alignment with our general practices, Control Testing has been developed with extensive feedback from our customers, and we are already seeing solid interest from new and existing customers with several beta customers already using the feature to embed proactive testing into their compliance frameworks. Strategy update As part of our 2026 strategy “Increasing the Impact”, we remain focused on enhancing platform capabilities and accelerating delivery speed. We are investing in Product and Development team capacity, while also scaling our go-to-market efforts across geographies and channels to drive pipeline development and market expansion. Following limited traction with templated compliance solutions in the mid-market, and based on the EU Omnibus package, we will continue to concentrate on the enterprise segment where we have a proven track record of attracting and expanding customer relationships. This focused approach means we do not anticipate doubling our customer base by the end of 2026. Though ARR growth in H1 2025 was more modest than anticipated, we remain confident in being able to become cash flow positive before the end of 2026. Equity and capital Impero maintained a solid cash position of DKK 6.8M at the end of H1 2025. The company continues to apply a balanced approach to investment and cash generation, ensuring sufficient liquidity to pursue its strategic plan. As of 30 June 2025, Impero’s equity stood at DKK 0.2M, compared to DKK 6.2M at 31 December 2024. This reduction, which represents a loss of more than 50% of the company’s share capital, reflects the investments made to support long-term growth. It is not unusual for SaaS companies in growth phases to experience periods of negative equity as product development and market scaling are prioritized over short-term profitability. Despite this equity shortfall, Impero remains in a solid financial position. In accordance with the Danish Companies Act, the Board of Directors is currently assessing options to address the equity position. If relevant, an update will be provided at a general assembly no later than the end of November 2025. Organizational developments As communicated in Company Announcement 09-2025, our CFO Morten Lehmann Nielsen will be stepping down at the end of August to pursue a career opportunity outside of Impero. We thank Morten for his contribution over the past 3½ years and wish him all the best in his future role. On 25 August 2025 Impero announced the appointment of Kasper Lihn as CFO, effective 1 October 2025 (Company Announcement No. 15-2025). We are excited to welcome Kasper, who joins Impero from HC Andersen Capital, where he holds the position Head of Research and Managing Director. Outlook Impero maintains the updated ARR guidance for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range. The outlook corresponds to an expected annual ARR growth rate between 11% and 19%. The company’s EBITDA is expected to be in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025), with continued focus on cost discipline in light of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) developing below initial expectations, impacting the timing of new initiatives. For the full outlook, we refer to page 8 in the H1 Report 2025. Presentation of the Report Read the Report in its entirety via or in the attached.

Monsenso’s H1 2025 report was approved by the Board of Directors today. Performance highlights Total revenue was DKK 5,166k (H1 2024: DKK 5,527k). EBITDA was DKK -1,755k (H1 2024: DKK –1,270k). EBIT was DKK -4,066k (H1 2024: DKK –3,484k). Cash from operations was DKK 666k (H1 2024: DKK –3,840k). Cash and cash equivalents were DKK 1,381k (FY 2024: DKK 1,861k). Business review We are pleased to report on the results and the development in H1 2025. Our continued commitment to innovation and strategic growth has yielded significant progress across multiple areas. Commercial Milestones Implementation revenue grew by 12% in the period, driven by the launch of a digital research platform in Birmingham (UK), which will be used to provide long-term engagement and monitoring of patients with treatment-resistant depression Our major digital, decentralised patient-centric study on headache/migraine with a global pharmaceutical company was completed with great success. New subscription revenue did not fully offset the completion of this project in the first half of 2025, which is the primary reason for a 16% decline in subscription revenue during this period. In collaboration with three Spanish partners, we were selected as a vendor for a large project in a public tender in Spain, and the extensive work on this during the next months will contribute to the expected growth of the business for the second half of 2025. Innovation and Research Our three major innovation and research projects, Phase V, PERSONAE and MENTBEST are now operational and recruitment of patients is progressing across their total of five studies. However, the projects have been delayed due to difficulties with approvals and patient recruitment, but we now look forward to seeing the results over the next couple of years. We have added great new functionalities to our digital health platform, including treatment content queue, automated content recommendations and patient screening. Cash Flow The payments from customers and credits from suppliers have improved in the period, causing cash from operations to be DKK 0.7m compared to DKK -3.8m in H1 2024. Unchanged outlook for 2025 For 2025, we expect revenue to be DKK 12-13m, corresponding to growth of 8-16% and an EBIT of DKK -7m to DKK -6m.

In geographic terms, the US along with the Swedish operations made the largest contribution to the sales growth, despite the fact the outcomes in the US were hampered by exchange-rate effects. The ongoing transition to service sales is progressing well, with growing recurring revenue. First quarter: May–July 2025 * Contracted order bookings rose 112.9% to SEK 1,309.5 million (615.0), of which SEK 1,192.3 million (543.1) pertained to guaranteed order bookings. Of the guaranteed order bookings, 7% were recognized as revenue during the quarter and a further estimated 13–23% will pertain to revenue within 12 months after the end of the quarter. * Net sales increased 5.8% to SEK 765.9 million (723.8). Based on unadjusted exchange rates compared with the year-earlier period, the increase was 12.1%. Recurring revenue accounted for SEK 549.2 million (482.3) of net sales, up 13.9%. Based on unadjusted exchange rates, the increase was 20.8%. Cloud recurring revenue (CRR) increased 46.1% to SEK 179.4 million (122.8). * Operating profit rose 19.0% to SEK 118.8 million (99.8), corresponding to an operating margin of 15.5% (13.8). The outcome includes SEK 36.1 million (12.5) in costs for share-based incentive programs. The increase was partly attributable to the start of a new program after the comparative quarter and partly to the share price trend. Based on unadjusted exchange rates compared with the year-earlier period, operating profit rose 35.9%. * Profit for the period amounted to SEK 102.8 million (80.4). * Cash flow from operations amounted to SEK 118.1 million (-56.7). The change was primarily the result of a decrease in capital tied up in current receivables. Comments from Torbjörn Kronander, President and CEO of Sectra AB “The fiscal year started with a favorable performance in both medical IT and cybersecurity. Growth in North America was particularly notable. We are also making progress in our change of business model to selling medical diagnostic imaging to healthcare providers. At the same time, we continue to strengthen society’s resilience against cyberthreats through our information security solutions. “The extensive customer contracts we secured in the last fiscal year will soon enter a phase during which customers will start to deploy our solutions, albeit gradually over a number of years. While several large healthcare providers will start producing examinations in 2025/2026, we expect the financial impact from this to remain relatively small during the fiscal year. Once these customers go live, our focus will be on helping them to maximize the benefits of our services and increasing their use—efforts that will ultimately generate stable growth in recurring revenue and further strengthen our customer relationships. “In Secure Communications, we see continuing favorable demand, not least as a result of security developments. While NATO’s decision during the summer to increase member states’ defense and security investments has not had an immediate impact on our business, it will create further opportunities in the long term. We are well positioned to contribute solutions for secure communication and information sharing that make societies more resistant to cyberthreats. Our solutions were used, for example, at the NATO summit in the Netherlands during the summer.” Read the attached financial report for further CEO comments and information.

The positive revenue performance reflected an increase in sales of both instruments, consumables and services. The launch of the new XcytoMatic products is proceeding as planned. “Along with our strong focus on creating renewed momentum in our existing business, we spent considerable resources during the financial year on launching our new high-tech XcytoMatic products. The launch of the XcytoMatic 40 is paving the way for ChemoMetec in the bioprocessing market, while the new XcytoMatic 30 and 50 instruments, both of which were developed on the same technology platform as the XcytoMatic 40, address our cell and gene therapy customers’ demand for automation. Automation is an attractive new market for us, and we believe that ChemoMetec has a strong market position in the current surge in automation – and we are in a process of taking full advantage of this opportunity. In the coming year, we will further accelerate the marketing of our new products, complete the development of another member of the XcytoMatic family, the XcytoMatic 50, continue working on the development of a new automation solution, the Sample Mana-gement System, and strengthen our software development while also maintaining focus on our existing business. We are very confident that our new solutions will make a strong contribution to our growth in the coming years. However, it is important to bear in mind that the XcytoMatic instruments address bioprocessing customers and customers with automation projects – and that the validation and decision-making process in this segment is relatively long. This means that it will require a degree of patience to unlock the expected great potential of our new products,” says Martin Helbo Behrens, CEO. Financial results In the 2024/25 financial year, revenue grew by 22% to DKK 495.6 million measured both in Danish kroner and at constant exchange rates. 59% of ChemoMetec’s revenue was generated in the USA/Canada, 32% in Europe and 9% in the rest of the world, unchanged relative to the 2023/24 financial year. Sales of instruments grew by 22% in 2024/25, while sales of consumables and services grew by 20% and 25%, respectively. EBITDA amounted to DKK 258.0 million in 2024/25, against DKK 186.2 million in 2023/24. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenue without a corresponding increase in costs. EBITDA was however affected by non-recurring restructuring costs of DKK 11.8 million. The EBITDA margin for 2024/25 was 52%, against 46% in 2023/24. The profit for the year was up by DKK 50.1 million year-on-year to DKK 186.4 million. Revenue for the year was in line with the preliminary 2024/25 figure announced on 1 July 2025, and EBITDA was in line with the most recent guidance announced on 10 January 2025. The Board of Directors proposes to the general meeting that a dividend of DKK 7.0 per share, equivalent to a total dividend payout of DKK 121.8 million, be distributed for the 2024/25 financial year. Guidance For 2025/26, ChemoMetec expects revenue in the range of DKK 545-565 million and EBITDA in the range of DKK 295-315 million.

The Group received one-off compensations for leasing argreements and capital gains from sold tangible assets in the last financial year, which has not previously recorded as an extraordinary item. Company description HLRE Holding Group (commonly known as Vesivek Group) is a leading provider of roof and roof product renovations, primarily offered to detached and row houses in Finland and Sweden under the Vesivek brand. In addition to roof and roof product installations, Vesivek provides underground drain renovations in eight locations in Finland. The Group also develops, manufactures, and sells high quality rainwater systems and roof safety products. HLRE Holding Group operates in 13 locations in Finland and three locations in Sweden and employing an average of approximately 700 employees. The Group has two production facilities in Finland, steel roofing profile production in Pirkkala and the production of rainwater systems and roof safety products in Orimattila. Management Overview of the second quarter The Group's revenue and gross profit improved in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Especially in Sweden the roof installation business performed very well. Revenue increase was 22% and gross profit increase 57%. In Finland roof installation and roof product sales grew compared to last year. Gross profit remained at previous year level due to the sales mix where sales were more focused on non-consumer projects with lower profitability. However, investments in revenue growth were reflected in increased fixed personnel costs and other fixed operating expenses. Due to that reason the adjusted EBITDA with EUR 0.6 million remained at previous year level. Despite revenue growth, sales volumes remained low in the second quarter, especially in the Finnish business areas. Q2 results fell short of our forecast. The Group has started negotiations in August to reduce fixed personnel costs in order to improve profitability towards the year end. Second quarter May - July 20245 Q2 revenue increased by 7 % to EUR 27.0 million (25.1 million). Revenue grew especially in roof installation business in Sweden. Gross profit was EUR 9.8 million (9.2 million). Q2 reported EBITDA was EUR 1.0 million (0.8 million) and adjusted EBITDA EUR 0.6 million (0.6 million). Despite the growth in revenue and gross profit, the adjusted EBITDA remained at previous year level due to higher fixed personnel and administrative expenses. The reported one-off items for Q2 May – July 2025 concern received capital gains from sold tangible assets (vehicles) amounted to EUR 0.4 million. Q2 operating cash flow was EUR 0.7 million (0.5 million). Cash flow increased due to the positive changes in working capital and lower net financial items. The change in cash and cash equivalents was EUR -0.1 million. First half 2025 H1 revenue increased by 7 % to EUR 48.8 EUR million (EUR 45.7 million). H1 gross profit increased to EUR 18.4 million (EUR 17.7 million). Revenue and gross profit grew especially in roof installation business in Sweden. H1 reported EBITDA decreased to EUR 0.8 million (1.1 million) and adjusted EBITDA to EUR 0.4 million (0.9 million). Reported adjustments in H1 amounted to EUR 0.4 and mainly concerned received capital gains from sold tangible assets (vehicles). H1 net cash from operating activities was EUR 1.2 million (EUR -2.6 million). Cash flow increased due to the positive changes in working capital, lower net financial items and lower paid taxes. The change in cash and cash equivalents was EUR -1.2 million due to the payments of lease liabilities and other borrowings. Outlook for the financial year 1 February 2025 – 31 January 2026 Market growth expectations for the installation business in Sweden are strong, and we expect growth in Swedish business to continue in the second half of the year. In Finland, on the contrary, market growth expectations will remain low. The Group has started negotiations in August to reduce fixed personnel costs in order to improve profitability towards the year end in Finnish roof installation business. We expect that the EBITDA will increase in H2 compared to the previous year level mainly due to the business growth in Sweden and cost saving operations in Finland. Risks and business continuity The Half Year Financial Report for the period of February 25 – July 25 has been prepared based on the going concern principle, assuming that the Company will have positive operating cash flow sufficient to meet it’s obligations as part of normal business operations in the foreseeable future. The Group's revenue and operating profit are affected by the general economic situation, which in turn is influenced by many factors beyond the Group's control. The Group currently operates in Finland and Sweden. Currently, most of the Group's operations are located in Finland. Accordingly, the Group's revenue and operating profit are particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and perceptions of future general economic situation in the Finnish and Swedish markets. Uncertainty or adverse developments in the general economic situation may affect the Group's business and demand for the Group's products and services, among other things, by affecting consumer confidence and adversely affecting the business of the Group's corporate customers who purchase the Group's rainwater systems and roof safety products. It is important to note that the general economic situation may adversely affect the level and cost of financing available to the Group's consumer and corporate clients to make investments in renovations and refurbishments. In addition, rising financing costs and a decrease in the level of available financing may adversely affect the Group's ability to make investments and achieve its strategic objectives, as well as adversely effect on the Group's business, financial position and results. Through its manufacturing operations, the Group is furthermore exposed to fluctuations in certain commodity prices (such as steel, aluminum and wood) and energy prices (especially through fuel costs for vehicles) and price increases due to economic disruptions and changes in general market conditions may adversely affect the Group's business, financial position and results. All the above factors may harm the Group's operations, and the Group cannot anticipate how the future economic environment and market conditions may affect the Group's operations. In general, the frequency of accidents at construction sites is noteworthy and the Group operates in a business segment subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding the work environment. Despite the required health and safety measures and, for example, the use of scaffolding to improve employee safety on construction sites, the Group is exposed to potentially fatal accidents at workplaces, particularly on roofing renovation sites, but also at its production facilities. In addition to physical injuries, the Group’s employees are exposed to risks related to hazardous substances, as some of the Group’s renovation sites contain asbestos. Respectively, the Group must also comply with specific environmental regulations with respect to asbestos. Finnish legislation has particularly strict requirements for any activities involving asbestos and the safety requirements for such activities. Failure to comply with the regulations concerning health and safety or asbestos related activities may result in liability for the Group and/or the Group’s permit being revoked. For example, if Group’s permit to handle asbestos would be revoked, the Group would need to stop all business activities relating to handling of asbestos and acquire the work through subcontractors. In addition, any potential accidents and health impacts adversely affect employee well-being. The Group as an employer is exposed to risks related to health and safety issues of its employees, which may lead to a decrease in employees’ ability to work. The Group’s management has prepared financial forecasts for revenue, expenses and investments, taking into account the refinancing of the bond and extensive efficiency measures. In assessing the going concern assumption, management believes that the company’s current liquid funds and projected operating cash flows will be sufficient to cover its liabilities and obligations arising from its operations for at least 12 months, so the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The forecasts assume a positive turn in the markets. In addition, the Group’s management has taken measures to improve the cash position by, for example, switching to the use of consignment stock for steel products. Due to general economic uncertainty, industry cyclicality, and the short time horizon of the order book, forecasting involves a higher degree of judgment than usual. If the business does not develop as forecasted, there is a risk of liquidity being compromised and covenants being breached, which may raise significant doubts about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Such factors would also affect the valuation of Group’s goodwill and the shares and receivables of the parent company’s subsidiaries at the balance sheet. The Finnish roof renovation and roof product installation business has not performed as planned in the first half year and EBITDA level has been lower than estimated. Finnish economy has not recovered as estimated in the beginning of the year. The Group went through the change negotiations in August, which resulted in a decrease of 70 person. Delays in recovery in Finnish roof renovation business will increase the risk that the Group will not meet covenant requirements at the end of the year 2025. The Group’s saving measures in August should improve financial results in the third quarter. The management will follow on monthly basis the business recovery and will prepare impairment tests in Q3 if saving measures are not efficient enough to convert Finnish roof renovation business performance.

for the Group, which consists of a Finnish public limited company operating under Finnish law, with business ID 2611405-7 (hereinafter “HLRE Holding”, “Company”, or “parent company”) and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as “HLRE”, “HLRE Group” or “Group”. The parent company’s domicile is Pirkkala, and its registered address is Jasperintie 273, FI-33960 Pirkkala, Finland. 2) Basis of preparation These consolidated Interim Financial Statements do not include all of the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and accordingly, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended January 31, 2025. The consolidated financial statements are presented as thousands of euros, unless otherwise specified, and the numbers are rounded off to the nearest thousand. Because of this, the sum of individual figures can deviate from the reported total. The company’s auditors have not reviewed this Interim Report. The management has assessed the Company's ability to continue its operations as a going concern for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Company's management has prepared forecasts for revenues, operating costs, and investments for the next twelve months. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the structural reorganization carried out in Finland in 2024 and continuing in 2025 has aligned the organization with demand. As of 31 July 2025, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 1.3 million. The management believes that the current cash balance is adequate to cover the Company's operational costs and investment plans for the next twelve months. Looking ahead, the Company anticipates the improved profitability and cash flow for the next quarter. Despite the inherent uncertainties, the management remains confident in the Company's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Taking into account the aforementioned factors and considerations, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management will continue to closely monitor the Company's financial performance and adapt its strategies as necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. 3) Seasonality of operations The Group operates in an industry that sees major seasonal changes. In a typical year, the second and third quarter together amount major share of the Group’s full-year EBITDA. Management has reacted to seasonal changes in customer volumes and demand for roof, roof product and underground drain renovations through workforce adjustment and structural changes in business area management and sales functions in Finland. 4) Segment information and revenue The Board of Directors of HLRE Holding is the Group’s chief operating decision maker, and operating segments have been specified based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors in order to allocate resources and assess the profitability of business operations. The Board of Directors manages the HLRE Group as a single integrated business aggregate, and therefore HLRE has a single operating and reportable segment. The revenue of the HLRE Holding Group is primarily generated by roofing, roof product and underground drain renovations for single-family homes and housing companies pursuant to the service concept developed by the Company, as well as project and direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products. The entire service chain – product development, manufacturing, sales and installation – is managed in-house by the Group. The HLRE Holding Group is operating in Finland and Sweden. Small-scale out of total H1 revenue was generated by direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products from Vesivek Tuotteet Oy in Finland to Baltic countries and Sweden. The Swedish turnover was generated by roofing and roof product installations and small-scale by direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products: Breakdown of revenue by country 1000 EUR Feb 25 – Jul 25 H1 Feb 24 – Jul 24 H1 Feb 24 – Jan 25 Q1-Q4 Finland 37 439 36 012 81 539 Sweden 11 023 9 381 20 797 Baltic countries 375 267 593 Total 48 837 45 660 102 929 5) Financial liabilities The Group announced in January 2024 that it had concluded the negotiations with the majority holder of the bond on the terms and conditions for refinancing the bond, while at the same time announcing that, as the maturity of the outstanding bonds, being 12 February 2024, was approaching, it will request for a one-month extension to finalize the terms and conditions. On 5 February 2024, the Group announced that the majority of the bondholders had approved the one-month extension. In February 2024, the Group continued to finalize the terms and conditions of the bond, announcing on 8 March 2024 the refinancing of the three-year SEK 300 million bond and the registration of the bond with Nasdaq Stockholm on 13 March 2024. The bond falls due for payment on 12 February 2027. The terms and conditions include an interest premium of 7.85% for the deferral of the payment dates between 12 February 2024 and 12 May 2025 until the loan maturity date. The updated terms and conditions also include the option after 12 May 2025 to postpone 30% of the 7.85% interest premium until the loan maturity date. The Group used the option and postponed 30 % of the interest premium during 12 May 2025 – 12 August 2025. In addition, the terms and conditions of the bond included a five-year convertible bond of EUR 3 million issued by the Company’s principal shareholders and around EUR 66 thousand to minor shareholders. The principal of the convertible bond is subject to a fixed annual interest rate of 8.00%. The accrued interest shall be paid on the maturity date of the loan or on the conversion date specified separately in the agreement, whichever earlier. Until then, all accrued interest will remain as debt, but the accrued interest will not be added to the loan principal and will not accrue interest. The updated terms and conditions of the bond do not include the net debt/EBITDA covenant until 2025 July. After that, the covenant will be 5.0 until January 2026, 4.5 between February 2026 and July 2026, and 4.0 from August 2026 until the loan maturity date in February 2027. The updated terms and conditions also include a liquidity covenant of EUR 2 million.

Furthermore, the following internal loans have been pledged as collateral for the bond agreement: Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to HLRE Group Ltd amounted to EUR 19,696,333 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Vesivek Ltd amounted to EUR 1,234,960 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Nesco Invest Ltd amounted to EUR 8,446.710 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd amounted to EUR 4,510,442 The following business mortgages have been confirmed and pledged as collateral for the bond and overdraft facility: HLRE Group Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Nesco Invest Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Sverige AB amounted to SEK 20 000 000 The following real estate mortgages have been pledged as collateral for the bond and overdraft facility: Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, Orimattila production plant, amounted to EUR 13 673 208. 7) Use of Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance Measures (APM) are financial measures of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than financial measures defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework. HLRE Group reports the financial measures [Gross profit], [Gross margin] and [Adjusted EBITDA] in its quarterly reports, which are not financial measures as defined in IFRS. The Group believes that the alternative performance measures provide significant additional information on HLRE’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows The APMs are used consistently over time and accompanied by comparatives for the previous periods. Gross profit= Revenues – cost of goods sold Gross margin (%) = Gross profit in relation to Revenue EBITDA = Operating profit (EBIT) + Depreciation + Amortization EBITDA % = EBITDA in relation to Revenue Adjusted EBITDA = EBITDA - EBITDA Adjustments Adjusted EBITDA % = (EBITDA - EBITDA Adjustments) / Revenue Operating profit (EBIT) % = Operating profit in relation to Revenue EBITDA adjustments = One-offs regarding restructuring costs and other non-recurring costs 8) Events after the Reporting Date The Group announced in August (4.8.2025) that it will restructure its organization and operational processes and will initiate change negotiations. In addition to changes in operating practices, the aim of the negotiations is to reduce management layers and enhance the efficiency of the sales organizations in Finland. The negotiations took place in August, started on 11 August 2025 and ended on 18 August 2025, and concerned all personnel of HLRE Group Ltd, Vesivek Ltd, and Vesivek Salaojat Ltd, excluding installers and foremen. Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, Tuusulan Peltikeskus Ltd, and Vesivek Sverige AB were entirely excluded from the change negotiations. As a result of the change negotiations, the number of personnel will decrease by 60 employees. Together with other changes in personnel in August, the amount of employees will decrease by 71 employees from July 2025 head count. The personnel changes are estimated to generate annual savings of EUR 5.0 million. The estimated one-off expenses from the change negotiations is estimated to be EUR 0.4 million and the expenses will be booked in the Q3 Interim Report. These measures are a response to the decline in market demand in recent years and, together with the company’s previous actions, aim to restore financial profitability.

This guidance,Interim report Q3 2024/25,"Interim report Q3 2024/25 Published: 2025-09-16 10:47:55 CEST Roblon A/S - Interim report (Q1 and Q3) Interim report Q3 2024/25 Roblon A/S reported increased revenue and earnings for the first nine months of 2024/25 Highlights Consolidated revenue for Q1-Q3 2024/25 amounted to DKKm 182.3, against DKKm 177.4 in the year-earlier period. The Composite product group generated revenue growth, while the FOC product group’s revenue declined. Operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items for Q1-Q3 2024/25 was DKKm 43.7 (DKKm 25.8) 1 and operating profit (EBIT) before special items was DKKm 33.3 (DKKm 13.7). Both revenue and earnings were realised at the upper end of the previously guided range for the first nine months of 2024/25. The improved earnings were due to a favourable product mix and realised productivity enhancements resulting from investments in production and ongoing optimisation of operations. For Q1-Q3 2024/25, the Group posted a profit from continuing operations before tax of DKKm 28.7 (DKKm 12.9). In Company Announcement no. 8 dated 24 July 2025, the Company stated that the divestment of Roblon’s US subsidiary had been completed. The effects of this on Roblon’s interim financial statements for the first nine months are as follows: A loss of DKKm 33.1 was recognised in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period, DKKm 5.4 of which related to advisory fees. An accumulated translation reserve of DKKm -10.2 concerning the divested US subsidiary was reclassified from equity and recognised as a loss in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period. Roblon’s receivable from the divested US subsidiary was written down from approx. USDm 12.5 to USDm 5.2 and included in Roblon’s non-current receivable in the amount of DKKm 33.7 at 31 July 2025. Roblon has retained ownership of one share with special dividend rights in the divested US subsidiary. The value of the share is recognised at DKKm 0 in Roblon’s balance sheet at 31 July 2025. At 31 July 2025, consolidated equity was reduced to DKKm 176.6 and the solvency ratio was reduced by 3.4 percentage points to 71.6% due to the value adjustment of the US subsidiary following the divestment. Roblon has no further liquidity obligations towards the divested US subsidiary. Guidance for 2024/25 Management’s previously announced guidance was that the Company’s revenue and earnings for Q4 would be at a lower level than in Q4 2023/24. This guidance is maintained, based on the lower order book at 31 July 2025 compared with 31 July 2024. Management maintains its most recent full-year guidance announced in Roblon’s interim report for H1 2024/25, although the guided ranges are narrowed as follows: revenue in the range of DKKm 230-250 against the previously guided range of DKKm 220-250 operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items in the range of DKKm 45-50 against the previously guided range of DKKm 40-50 operating profit (EBIT) before special items in the range of DKKm 31-36 against the previously guided range of DKKm 26-36 1 In the interim report, realised amounts for the previous year are stated in brackets.

The order backlog at 30 June 2025 stands at DKK 39,7 million (2023/24: DKK 38,8 million) with an order intake during 2024/25 of DKK 37,8 million (2023/24 DKK 10,3 million). Rovsing’s current portfolio of contracts is diverse, ranging across several different missions and customers in both institutional and commercial space. The industry outlook continues to progress positively with large EU and European national missions moving forward to the next tendering phase where Rovsing remains a key-supplier supporting the ambitions of all major European prime contractors. During the financial year 2024/25, the revenue amounted to DKK 37,0 million (DKK 39,3 million in 2023/24), which is a decrease of 5,7 % (DKK -2,2 million) while still stabilizing revenue on a high level compared to recent years. EBITDA amounted to DKK 1,3 million (DKK 2,9 million in 2023/24) or a decrease of DKK 1,6 million. The 2024/25 EBITDA is impacted by one-time effects related to the replanning of two larger projects. Rovsing has projects that have been delayed for extensive periods by their customers. These delays incur an increase in material costs and effort due to inflation in the same period. Rovsing expects to have those impacts settled with the customers. Until settlement is reached proceeds cannot be quantified and are therefore not included. STRATEGY ACCELERATION AND INCREASED AMBITIONS Rovsing is building on a solid turnaround and stable European foundation to accelerate global growth within the Space and Defense segments. With the Company’s strong positions in ESA and EU space programs, the Company is looking to expand further into high-potential markets while pursuing a selective buy-and-build strategy. The focus is to strengthen the core Space business and extend into adjacent Defense markets where our expertise in mission-critical testing and software validation provides clear synergies. By combining organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and customer-driven innovation, Rovsing is positioned to scale faster, broaden our market reach, and deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders and stakeholders alike. To support the strategic ambitions the Company will carry out an already fully subscribed directed share issue, by key investors, members of the Board of Directors and Management, to provide additional financing to support the strategy and allow the necessary investments & due diligence for facilitating a substantial financing round aimed at clear buy-and-build targets during 2026. At the upcoming Annual General Assembly, the aim is that the Board of Directors will be strengthened further with the addition of proposed new members Lars Ankjer and Christian Klarskov. Based on the current order backlog for Rovsing core business, the revenue outlook for 2025/26 is expected to be in the range of DKK 37,0 to 41,0 million, with a positive EBITDA in the range of DKK 1,0 to 3,0 million.

In line with the 2023/24 strategy, the Company has explored and engaged in opportunities for partnerships and expansion as well as reaching out to new entrants into the market. The order backlog at 30 June 2025 stands at DKK 39,7 million (2023/24: DKK 38,8 million) with an order intake during 2024/25 of DKK 37,8 million (2023/24 DKK 10,3 million). Rovsing’s current portfolio of contracts is diverse, ranging across several different missions and customers in both institutional and commercial space. The industry outlook continues to progress positively with large EU and European national missions moving forward to the next tendering phase where Rovsing remains a key-supplier supporting the ambitions of all major European prime contractors. During the financial year 2024/25, the revenue amounted to DKK 37,0 million (DKK 39,3 million in 2023/24), which is a decrease of 5,7 % (DKK -2,2 million) while still stabilizing revenue on a high level compared to recent years. EBITDA amounted to DKK 1,3 million (DKK 2,9 million in 2023/24) or a decrease of DKK 1,6 million. The 2024/25 EBITDA is impacted by one-time effects related to the replanning of two larger projects. Rovsing has projects that have been delayed for extensive periods by their customers. These delays incur an increase in material costs and effort due to inflation in the same period. Rovsing expects to have those impacts settled with the customers. Until settlement is reached proceeds cannot be quantified and are therefore not included. STRATEGY ACCELERATION AND INCREASED AMBITIONS Rovsing is building on a solid turnaround and stable European foundation to accelerate global growth within the Space and Defense segments. With the Company’s strong positions in ESA and EU space programs, the Company is looking to expand further into high-potential markets while pursuing a selective buy-and-build strategy. The focus is to strengthen the core Space business and extend into adjacent Defense markets where our expertise in mission-critical testing and software validation provides clear synergies. By combining organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and customer-driven innovation, Rovsing is positioned to scale faster, broaden our market reach, and deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders and stakeholders alike. To support the strategic ambitions the Company will carry out an already fully subscribed directed share issue, by key investors, members of the Board of Directors and Management, to provide additional financing to support the strategy and allow the necessary investments & due diligence for facilitating a substantial financing round aimed at clear buy-and-build targets during 2026. At the upcoming Annual General Assembly, the aim is that the Board of Directors will be strengthened further with the addition of proposed new members Lars Ankjer and Christian Klarskov. Based on the current order backlog for Rovsing core business, the revenue outlook for 2025/26 is expected to be in the range of DKK 37,0 to 41,0 million, with a positive EBITDA in the range of DKK 1,0 to 3,0 million.

Our mission is to provide our customers with the innovative test and simulations products, systems and services they require, for supporting their critical path, which is constantly challenged by the need to innovate, optimise and overcome internal & external challenges. Accelerating Growth on a Strong Foundation Rovsing has successfully completed its turnaround and is now entering a new phase of accelerated growth. Building on a stable European core, our strategy focuses on delivering sustained organic growth while expanding globally into high-potential markets in the USA, Middle East, and APAC.

Our goal is to replicate and expand upon our European success to become a recognized global player. Buy-and-Build Strategy & New Verticals To accelerate growth, Rovsing is pursuing a selective buy-and-build strategy. We are actively evaluating acquisitions and partnerships that enhance our core capabilities in space testing while opening new opportunities in adjacent Defense verticals, where our competencies in mission-critical test and validation solutions are highly relevant. This dual-track strategy allows us to scale faster, broaden our customer base, and increase resilience. Agility and Customer-Centric Innovation Rovsing’s reputation rests on our ability to stay agile and customer-focused. Our clients—from space agencies and institutions to LSIs—value our capacity to deliver tailored, innovative solutions with speed and precision.

In line with the 2023/24 strategy, the Company has explored and engaged in opportunities for partnerships and expansion as well as reaching out to new entrants into the market. The order backlog at 30 June 2025 stands at DKK 39,7 million (2023/24: DKK 38,8 million) with an order intake during 2024/25 of DKK 37,8 million (2023/24 DKK 10,3 million). Rovsing’s current portfolio of contracts is diverse, ranging across several different missions and customers in both institutional and commercial space. The industry outlook continues to progress positively with large EU and European national missions moving forward to the next tendering phase where Rovsing remains a key-supplier supporting the ambitions of all major European prime contractors. During the financial year 2024/25, the revenue amounted to DKK 37,0 million (DKK 39,3 million in 2023/24), which is a decrease of 5,7 % (DKK -2,2 million) while still stabilizing revenue on a high level compared to recent years. EBITDA amounted to DKK 1,3 million (DKK 2,9 million in 2023/24) or a decrease of DKK 1,6 million. The 2024/25 EBITDA is impacted by one-time effects related to the replanning of two larger projects. Rovsing has projects that have been delayed for extensive periods by their customers. These delays incur an increase in material costs and effort due to inflation in the same period. Rovsing expects to have those impacts settled with the customers. Until settlement is reached proceeds cannot be quantified and are therefore not included. STRATEGY ACCELERATION AND INCREASED AMBITIONS Rovsing is building on a solid turnaround and stable European foundation to accelerate global growth within the Space and Defense segments. With the Company’s strong positions in ESA and EU space programs, the Company is looking to expand further into high-potential markets while pursuing a selective buy-and-build strategy. The focus is to strengthen the core Space business and extend into adjacent Defense markets where our expertise in mission-critical testing and software validation provides clear synergies. By combining organic growth, strategic acquisitions, and customer-driven innovation, Rovsing is positioned to scale faster, broaden our market reach, and deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders and stakeholders alike. To support the strategic ambitions the Company will carry out an already fully subscribed directed share issue, by key investors, members of the Board of Directors and Management, to provide additional financing to support the strategy and allow the necessary investments & due diligence for facilitating a substantial financing round aimed at clear buy-and-build targets during 2026. At the upcoming Annual General Assembly, the aim is that the Board of Directors will be strengthened further with the addition of proposed new members Lars Ankjer and Christian Klarskov. Based on the current order backlog for Rovsing core business, the revenue outlook for 2025/26 is expected to be in the range of DKK 37,0 to 41,0 million, with a positive EBITDA in the range of DKK 1,0 to 3,0 million. Further information: Hjalti Pall Thorvardarson, CEO. Tel. +45 53 39 18 88. Email: ROVSING’S STRATEGY Rovsing has a position as a key agile high-tech SME in the Space & Defense Industry. Our mission is to provide our customers with the innovative test and simulations products, systems and services they require, for supporting their critical path, which is constantly challenged by the need to innovate, optimise and overcome internal & external challenges. Accelerating Growth on a Strong Foundation Rovsing has successfully completed its turnaround and is now entering a new phase of accelerated growth. Building on a stable European core, our strategy focuses on delivering sustained organic growth while expanding globally into high-potential markets in the USA, Middle East, and APAC. At the same time, we are strengthening our position through a focused buy-and-build strategy, targeting complementary companies in the Space segment and adjacent Defense activities that leverage our proven expertise in test systems, test products, and Independent Software Validation & Verification (ISVV). Leadership in Europe as a Growth Platform As an agile high-tech SME in the Space & Defense industry, Rovsing remains a trusted supplier to leading European institutions and Large-Scale Integrators (LSIs/OEMs). Our strong track record across major ESA and EU space programs provides a solid platform for continued expansion. We will maintain and grow these relationships by delivering high-quality, innovative solutions, while investing further in R&D, AI/ML integration, and resilient supply chains to anticipate and meet evolving market needs. Expanding International Reach With a stabilized core business, Rovsing is scaling internationally. We are establishing a stronger presence in the USA, Middle East, and APAC by adapting our proven offerings to local demands, forging strategic partnerships, and capitalizing on emerging opportunities in both institutional and commercial Space & Defense markets. Our goal is to replicate and expand upon our European success to become a recognized global player. Buy-and-Build Strategy & New Verticals To accelerate growth, Rovsing is pursuing a selective buy-and-build strategy. We are actively evaluating acquisitions and partnerships that enhance our core capabilities in space testing while opening new opportunities in adjacent Defense verticals, where our competencies in mission-critical test and validation solutions are highly relevant. This dual-track strategy allows us to scale faster, broaden our customer base, and increase resilience. Agility and Customer-Centric Innovation Rovsing’s reputation rests on our ability to stay agile and customer-focused. Our clients—from space agencies and institutions to LSIs—value our capacity to deliver tailored, innovative solutions with speed and precision. This agility, combined with deep technical expertise, sets us apart and reinforces long-term customer trust. People as the Driver of Growth Our employees’ knowledge and commitment are central to Rovsing’s success. We remain dedicated to fostering an agile, inclusive, and innovative culture that empowers our people to thrive and grow. Investing in talent is key to driving innovation, strengthening execution, and securing the long-term success of our strategy. Delivering Sustainable Value Rovsing is positioned for sustainable growth, combining organic development with strategic acquisitions. A solid order backlog, a growing international pipeline, and a reputation for reliability and innovation form the foundation for scaling the business. We will continue transparent engagement with customers, partners, shareholders, and the financial community to ensure alignment and build long-term trust. Looking Ahead Rovsing’s future is defined by three priorities: Maintain leadership in Europe as a trusted systems, service and product supplier. Accelerate through buy-and-build , strengthening our core in Space and extending into the Defense segment. Expand globally with targeted growth leveraging our core offerings to further markets. With this strategy, Rovsing is well-positioned to deliver sustained value for customers and shareholders while cementing its role as a leading European systems house with global reach.
