Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured above DKK 3,000 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus entering the targeted guidance interval for this business. COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 9, 2025 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) today announced the award of a contract valued over DKK 200 million to supply its MVA-BN ® smallpox/mpox vaccine to a European country. This is another larger order in recent years from the country to strengthen national preparedness against biological threats and epidemics like smallpox and mpox. Paul Chaplin, President & CEO of Bavarian Nordic , said: “As Europe continues to strengthen its resilience in the face of evolving geopolitical threats, we are proud to support efforts to increase public health security by supplying our MVA-BN ® smallpox/mpox vaccine, which remains a vital tool for managing mpox outbreaks as well as for safeguarding populations against future smallpox threats. This new order underscores the growing recognition of biological preparedness as a cornerstone of national and regional security. We remain committed to working with EU and its member states to ensure rapid access to critical medical countermeasures, reinforcing public health infrastructure and contributing to a safer, more secure future. We are also pleased to extend our collaboration with countries outside Europe, demonstrating the value of our long-term partnerships to build and strengthen preparedness.” The order will be delivered in 2025. Along with other orders recently secured from non-European countries, it brings the total value of secured contracts in the Public Preparedness business to slightly above DKK 3,000 million, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this arm of the business for 2025 (DKK 3,000-4,000 million). Total revenue and EBITDA margin for the year remain unchanged at DKK 5,700-6,700 million and 26-30% respectively. About the smallpox/mpox vaccine MVA-BN or Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic is the only non-replicating mpox vaccine approved in the U.S., Switzerland, Singapore and Mexico (marketed as JYNNEOS ® ), Canada (marketed as IMVAMUNE ® ), and the EU/EAA and United Kingdom (marketed as IMVANEX ® ). Originally developed as a smallpox vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. government to ensure the supply of a smallpox vaccine for the entire population, including immunocompromised individuals who are not recommended vaccination with traditional replicating smallpox vaccines, MVA-BN has been indicated for use in the general population in individuals considered at risk for smallpox or mpox infection. About Bavarian Nordic Bavarian Nordic is a global vaccine company with a mission to improve health and save lives through innovative vaccines. We are a preferred supplier of mpox and smallpox vaccines to governments to enhance public health preparedness and have a leading portfolio of travel vaccines.

However, the global environment is uncertain, and we must adapt accordingly. Our focus is on what we can influence – our customer dialogues, the management of our properties, and our relationships in the capital market. This becomes even more important in a challenging rental market. I believe we should be proud of our strong performance. In line with our previously stated ambition, we have increased our growth efforts during the quarter. We have continued to invest in our properties and projects, and have also completed the acquisition of high-quality properties in Uppsala, Örebro and Linköping with a total property value of SEK 1.7 Bn. Our net investment for the first half of the year amounts to SEK 2.8 Bn. These investments will contribute positively to our earnings going forward. In the second quarter, net leasing was once again positive, though modest at SEK 2 M. Rental income in the like-for-like portfolio increased, and our balance sheet remains strong with a loan-to-value ratio of 36.7 per cent. The credit rating agency Moody’s upgraded Castellum’s rating to Baa2 with a stable outlook, and we refinanced bank loans totalling SEK 10 Bn. Given current market conditions, I believe we have navigated effectively and are well positioned for future opportunities”, says Joacim Sjöberg, CEO of Castellum Aktiebolag.

Outlook and guidance Finnair’s guidance regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result for 2025 has been clarified following the end of industrial action. Guidance excluding any direct impact of industrial action is unchanged. However, Finnair specifies that, based on the current information, the comparable operating result is estimated to be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Under Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025, the company provides additional information on the impacts of industrial action, as well as an estimate of capacity growth, revenue and comparable operating result in 2025, considering the direct impacts of industrial action. Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability and the threat of trade wars cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts are elevated. Excluding the direct impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. In 2025, profitability is further burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the second quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates above regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include direct impacts of industrial action. In total, the direct negative impact of industrial action in 2025 is estimated to be approximately 100 million euros on revenue, approximately 70 million euros on comparable operating result and approximately 5% on the total capacity, measured by ASKs. In the first half of 2025, industrial action had a direct impact of around -72 million euros on revenue and around -51 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, the three days of industrial action in July and the flights cancelled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following industrial action, including wet lease out flights, are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 25 million euros, other operating income by approximately 5 million euros and comparable operating result by approximately 20 million euros in the third quarter. Based on the cancellations confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a direct negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Considering the direct negative impacts of industrial action, Finnair plans to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 5% year-on-year and estimates its revenue to be within the range of 3.2–3.3 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 30–130 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the interim report January–September 2025. Previous outlook and guidance issued on 29 April 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability, the threat of trade wars and a tense labour market situation in Finland cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts have increased. Excluding the impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. In 2025, profitability is burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the first quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include impacts of industrial action. In the first quarter of 2025, industrial action had a negative impact of around 31 million euros on revenue and around 22 million euros on the comparable operating result. In April 2025, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of around 15 million euros on revenue and around 10 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, regardless of the duration of industrial action, Finnair has decided to cancel 230 flights scheduled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following the industrial action, which is estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 30 million euros and the comparable operating result by approximately 10 million euros. Based on the cancellations already confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the 2025 half-year report. CEO Turkka Kuusisto: The challenges Finnair faced at the beginning of the year continued into the second quarter. We carried over 3 million passengers, and our revenue grew slightly compared to the same period last year. However, our comparable operating result was particularly burdened by industrial action by the Finnish Airline Pilots’ Association in April and by the ground service personnel’s Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) in May and June. I want to extend my heartfelt apologies to each customer whose travel plans were disrupted by the industrial action. We reached collective labour agreements with the pilots, cabin crew, and travel agency staff during the quarter. The Service Sector Employers Palta and the IAU also came to an agreement after the period, so we are once again able to operate our flights with the reliability that is expected of us. The direct negative impact of the prolonged industrial action on second quarter revenue was around 41 million euros, on other operating income around 10 million euros, and on the comparable operating result around 29 million euros. We had to cancel over 1,300 flights during the quarter due to the industrial action, incurring costs related to customer rerouting and care, as well as compensation for delays. To support our customers’ important travel plans, we allowed them to reschedule flights away from the disruption days without additional fees, which reduced sales on the days to which flights were moved. The uncertainty caused by the disruptions also affected demand for our flights and customer satisfaction. Restoring customer trust and satisfaction is of primary importance to us, and we are systematically working towards this by taking care of our customers and their needs as well as possible, both in the development of our product and services and in our daily operations. Despite the disruptions caused by industrial action, our operational quality remained high, and we were able to operate 94% of our flights as planned. During the summer season, we operate about 350 flights per day, and even on disruption days, we managed to operate 60–75% of our flights. We have invested in improving the customer experience, particularly in terms of the smoothness of rerouting and customer communication, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of industrial action on our customers during the important summer travel season. During the quarter, general market uncertainties increased, which began to affect demand for transatlantic flights, and customers’ booking windows became shorter. Our North American traffic grew significantly, but the growth rate was more moderate than previously planned, and average ticket fares in the area declined. In other markets, demand developed as expected. We continued optimising our network and announced new summer 2026 routes to Toronto, Canada, and Alta in Northern Norway. We also added flights to Finnish Lapland for the winter 2025 season. In June, air travellers chose Finnair as the Best Airline in Northern Europe for the 15th consecutive time, and our cabin crew was also named the best in Northern Europe. This recognition is owed especially to Finnair employees in the front line who work with dedication every day to ensure safe and smooth flights.

The financial outlook is subject to several assumptions including: Satisfactory execution of high-voltage projects and investments to deliver on expected profitability margins Satisfactory operational execution across business lines Stable market conditions for Applications and Service & Accessories Normalised offshore power cable repair work activity Stable supply chain with limited disruptions and access to the required labour, materials, and services Stable development in the global economy, foreign currency, and metal prices 13% organic growth and operational EBITDA of EUR 105m In Q2 2025, NKT’s revenue (in std. metal prices) amounted to EUR 723m, an increase of EUR 118m compared to Q2 2024, corresponding to 13% organic growth. In Solutions, the growth was driven by a high activity level and overall satisfactory project execution, while the increased revenue in Applications was driven by the acquisition of SolidAl in June 2024, and organic growth from additional medium-voltage production capacity. In Service & Accessories, revenue growth was driven by a higher activity level in the Accessories business. Operational EBITDA increased to a record-high level of EUR 105m in Q2 2025 compared to EUR 86m in Q2 2024. The increase was driven by the Applications and Service & Accessories business lines.

Following the issuance of company announcement no. 83 at the end of April 2025, in which the company's board of directors chose to suspend the financial guidance for the financial year 2025 in light of the high geopolitical uncertainty, the board of directors has today decided to resume publication of the Company's financial guidance. The resumption is based on the following two elements: On Sunday, July 27, 2025, the US government and the EU Commission entered into a political agreement to impose a 15% import tariff on most EU goods. The agreement was described as a framework covering cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors – all subject to the 15% tariff – while a 50% tariff on steel and aluminium remained in force, as these were not included in the new agreement. As US is an important market for FOM, any clarity on import tariff rates are relevant to the company. A gradual return to a more normalized order flow and increased order intake following the end of H1 2025. Overall, the company believes in light of the above, a detailed review of the order intake and following the end of H1 2025 that there is now sufficient clarity on the expected overall development for 2025. The company's future and previous guidance (before suspension) is listed below: NEW FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2025: Total income: In the range from DKK 40 mio. to DKK 50 mio. EBITDA: In the range from DKK -25 mio. to DKK -15 mio.

At end-Q2 2025, NKT maintained a robust balance sheet, with net interest-bearing debt of EUR -757m. Execution of the high-voltage capacity investments progressed as planned during Q2 2025. At the expansion of the site in Karlskrona, Sweden, intense execution continued across several workstreams. The work inside the new extrusion tower progressed, as well as construction of surrounding buildings and expansion of the harbour facilities. During the quarter, the new logistics centre was inaugurated as the first completed building. Construction of the new cable-laying vessel, NKT Eleonora, also progressed as planned. Both the new production capacity and the new cable-laying vessel are expected to be gradually operational from 2027. Segment key financial highlights Q2 2025 Revenue* Operational EBITDA Op.

The revised outlook now assumes net revenue of EUR 485–515 million (previously EUR 530–565 million) and an adjusted EBITDA range of EUR 125–140 million (previously EUR 155–175 million). The downward revision of the forecast is due to two factors, which stand in contrast to the development anticipated in the original outlook. First, a one-off impact from more severe technical issues arising from the platform unification leading to direct revenue impacts, and in particular prolonged recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities after the completion of technical unification. Secondly, the Company sees significantly stronger negative FX translation impacts as well as outlook than Management previously anticipated. The technical challenges, which relate solely to platform unification of in-app marketplace activities on the supply side, have turned out to be much more demanding than anticipated in the extensive planning process of the project. In particular, noticeable delays in the onboarding of new customers meant that incremental new revenues could only be realized with considerable delays. Various technical issues in relation to load balancer performance, temporary interruptions in bidding volumes, and temporary asynchrony of AI algorithms, led to revenue reductions during the unification process. The process of unifying all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform has now, however, been completed in July, which will lead to significantly improved platform performance, cost efficiency and scaling going forward. The recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities has proven slower than expected, as observed in onboarding of new customers and customer scaling. Management foresees only a low probability of catching up on the unforeseen adverse revenue impacts from the unification process. These circumstances are estimated to have an adverse effect of approximately EUR 34 million on net revenues, which translates into a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately EUR 19 million. Additionally, increased infrastructure and one-off support costs during the unification process have a further adverse effect on adjusted EBITDA of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the development in the currency exchange rate between USD and EUR in recent months along with revised planning assumption for the remainder of the year leads to a changed and more material translation impact estimation for the full year. While the original outlook, published on 28 May 2025, foresaw a possibility of a lower conversion of USD into EUR, communicated as +/- 2 percent revenue translation effect for the full year, the current USD/EUR exchange rate is materially lower than the original planning assumption, and the Company has to factor in a USD/EUR exchange rate at the current level for the remainder of the year. This unfavorable development in exchange rates is estimated to have a translation effect lowering our full-year EBITDA outlook by approximately EUR 9 million. --- end of inside information pursuant to art. 17 MAR --- In order to provide markets with the best available information on the operational performance in the second quarter of 2025 – although not being the reason for the revision of the outlook for 2025 - the Company has decided to bring forward the publication of its half-year report 2025 to 15 August 2025.

The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for original equipment is expected to remain soft.

Consequently, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 change its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. Preliminary and unaudited key figures for Q2 2025 and H1 2025 Service Products PC&V Consolidated Group Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Revenue, DKK 2.1bn 4.2bn 0.6bn 1.4bn 0.7bn 1.4bn 3.4bn 7.1bn Adj.

In addition, the Adjusted EBITA margin now also excludes Other Operating Net Income totalling income of DKK 59m and DKK 77m in Q2 2025 and H1 2025, respectively. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% The financial guidance for the full year 2025 has been updated. As such, FLSmidth now expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth now expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for original equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025. Presentation of the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report FLSmidth will, as previously communicated, release the detailed and unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025 on 20 August 2025. FLSmidth will host a conference call for investors and analysts on Wednesday 20 August 2025 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. The presentation can be followed live or viewed as a replay via the internet here .

CEO Mikko Karvinen comments on the development during the period: Nexstim continued its positive trend in terms of net sales growth and improved results during the first half of 2025. In H1 2025, we achieved total net sales of EUR 4.5 (3.2) million, representing growth of 41.8%. Gross margin increased by more than EUR 1 million from the comparable period last year to EUR 3.6 (2.6) million, which is a result of the favorable development of our sales volumes and prices. The increased customs duties in the United States did not have a significant impact on the results for the first half of 2025, and we have sought to minimize the potential impact of customs duties on future periods by taking them into account in new system sales offers. We were particularly pleased with the positive development of EBITDA during the first half of the year. EBITDA was EUR 0.2 (-0.5) million and was positively record-breaking for two consecutive half-years. The operating result for the first half of the year also showed improvement in the right direction, at EUR -0.2 (-0.9) million, with a result for the review period of EUR -0.3 (-0.9) million. The result was improved by a non-recurring item of EUR 0.2 million, which was the first installment of the license fee for the exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica. I thank Nexstim's customers, personnel, partners, and investors for the continuation of this positive development. In line with the main objective of Nexstim's 2025–2028 strategy, we have focused on profitable net sales growth, and our sales forecast for full year 2025 looks promising. This growth is now supported by our global distributor partner network, which was strengthened at the end of last year by the Brainlab cooperation agreement. We are now looking to take immediate advantage of this, particularly in the marketing and sales of diagnostics systems in the United States and Europe. In early 2025, we developed and trained our partner network for the Diagnostics business in close cooperation with Brainlab. This will enable us to effectively and comprehensively deliver our sales and marketing message to as many markets as possible among Brainlab's thousands of existing customers. In addition to this collaboration, Nexstim's direct sales and marketing still have significant opportunities for developing the Therapy business, research and neuroscience customers, and the clinic partner network. We aim to continue leveraging our expert and efficient global teams to ensure positive profitability development. This was reflected in the moderate 11 percent growth in operating expenses in early 2025, enabling a simultaneous 40 percent increase in gross margin. Business update We have continued to grow our Diagnostics (NBS, Navigated Brain Stimulation) and Therapy (NBT ® , Navigated Brain Therapy and NBS 6) businesses through the sale of new systems in our key markets in the US and Europe. Our growing installed base generates a steady stream of net sales which increases the stability and predictability of our operations. The Diagnostics business grew by 65.3% during the first half of 2025, with net sales of EUR 2.5 (1.5) million. We delivered a total of seven new diagnostic systems during H1 2025. To date, we have sold more than 250 diagnostic systems to research universities and leading hospitals around the world. We are pleased that more of our customers want to use Nexstim system for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The NBS System 5 configuration, NBS 5+, has enabled the use of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the same system. This offering means that all FDA 510(k) indications are available in the same system on the US market. Most of the diagnostic systems delivered in early 2025 have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We consider combination systems to be a clear competitive advantage and aim to launch the latest generation of NBS 6 combination systems in key markets during the second half of 2025, following regulatory approvals. Net sales from the therapy business decreased by 8.4% during the first half of 2025 and amounted to EUR 1.4 (1.6) million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in system sales in the Therapy business, which fell by 37.0% compared to the same period last year. During H1 2025, we delivered one purely therapeutic system to Europe and the rest of the world. This development was mainly since most of the therapy applications were delivered in connection with Diagnostics and Research and Neuroscience system. At the end of June 2025, there were a total of 116 Nexstim systems with therapy applications installed worldwide (43 in the United States and 73 in Europe and the rest of the world) for the treatment of depression and chronic neuropathic pain. This number includes both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems as well as NBS systems with optional NBT add-on software installed. With the new strategy period, we now also report separately the net sales of the Research and Neuroscience business, which grew by as much as 565.7% during the first half of 2025, amounting to EUR 0.6 (0.1) million. This rapid growth was due to the sale of two research systems and a EUR 0.2 million license fee from Sinaptica's exclusive agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned system already delivered, we had an open order backlog of eight systems at the end of June 2025. In June 2024, we announced disagreements regarding the licensing of our technology to the US medical technology company Magnus Medical, Inc. Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems. The importance of partnerships is likely to increase in the future in the Therapy business as well, as we leverage our unique expertise and technology in emerging treatment areas. Our second strategic objective for 2025 is to successfully support the long-term collaboration between Nexstim and Brainlab and to expand our network of other partners and clinics, primarily in the United States. I strongly believe that combining Nexstim's technological expertise and first-class services with Brainlab's innovative products, which have significant business growth potential and are well suited to Nexstim's offering and global customer base of leading hospitals, will create maximum value for patients, neurosurgeons, hospitals, and shareholders. Outside of Brainlab's exclusive rights, Nexstim will continue to independently develop, market, and sell its products and services in all markets for current and future neuroscience research solutions and therapeutic applications. This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area. The gross margin target set for 2025 is EUR 4 million. The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system. The development and launch of a new product generation will continue to be an essential part of Nexstim's operations during the 2025–2028 strategy period. NBS 6 is a new combination system built on Nexstim's unique, clinically established technology, with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Nexstim's NBS 6 system has FDA marketing and distribution approval for the treatment of major depression in the United States and is CE-approved in Europe for the treatment of major depression and chronic neuropathic pain. We will now continue to finalize the development of the system and progress regulatory approvals during 2025 so that, in line with our strategic objective, we will also have diagnostic applications launched in the key markets as part of the new NBS 6 system. Building future growth paths Our system clearly stands out from other TMS systems currently on the market, which do not have navigation features. In the future, the need for navigation functionality is likely to become even more important in technology, enabling more diverse treatment of brain disorders. This may open new markets for Nexstim in TMS treatments beyond severe depression and chronic neuropathic pain. The technological leadership, ease of use, and scalability of our product create an attractive foundation for growth through partnerships. In January 2025, the company announced the start of joint development of the SinaptiStim ® precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease together with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. (""Sinaptica""). The company announced that the planned delivery of the research system for the first validation testing, and future clinical trials was in March. Nexstim announced that it is developing the system according to Sinaptica's specifications, combining it with a high-resolution 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system from Bittium, which enables precision calibration of the therapy for each Alzheimer's patient. The new research system will be used in Sinaptica's upcoming clinical trials related to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with several studies planned to begin in 2025. At the end of June 2025, the Company announced that it had signed an exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. regarding the companies' planned collaboration in the field of Alzheimer's disease treatment. The signed agreement covers plans for 2025. The final agreement is expected to be drafted and signed before the end of the year. In June 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent with Sinaptica regarding the development, manufacture, and supply of Sinaptica's patented precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The system is based on Nexstim's NBS 6 medical TMS and neuronavigation systems and related software, including integrated EEG software. As part of the signed exclusive agreement, Sinaptica undertakes to order the research system it needs for clinical trials from Nexstim, and Nexstim will not commercialize its technology in the field of Alzheimer's disease independently or with partners other than Sinaptica. The agreed exclusivity is conditional upon payments of EUR 1.5 million in multiple installments to Nexstim during 2025. The planned partnership would be a global, 10-year exclusive arrangement. The financial structure of the partnership consists of a signing fee for the disclosed exclusivity rights, a milestone-based development project, and the sale of clinical and commercial system. The milestone-based project and purchases of clinical system are defined in more detail in the final agreements, which may be subject to change during negotiations. The long-term exclusive rights arrangement also depends on payments to be made by Sinaptica during 2025 and the signing of final agreements before the end of 2025. Building shareholder value while taking exceptional circumstances into account Despite the tense global political situation, our expectations for the rest of 2025 are positive in many ways. Our current business is heavily focused on the EU and the US, but with our new partners, we will continue to actively expand Nexstim's technology into the Asian market. Nexstim will continue its determined efforts to develop personalized and effective methods for the treatment and diagnosis of severe brain diseases and disorders. We strongly believe that our work will support long-term shareholder value growth in the form of increasingly strong competitive advantages, rapid growth, and improved financial results. Nexstim’s business areas Diagnostics Business Nexstim’s NBS 5 system is the only CE-marked and FDA-cleared non-invasive solution for pre-surgical mapping of the motor cortex in brain cancer. Clinical data has been generated demonstrating the value of Nexstim’s unique navigation system for pre-surgical mapping with regard to patient outcomes. The system allows surgeons to be better prepared and more aggressive with tumor resection, due to their confidence in the location of the motor and speech cortex because of pre-surgical mapping. More than 250 diagnostic systems have been sold to research universities and leading hospitals across the world. Therapy Business Nexstim’s NBT ® and NBS 6 systems are based on its unique navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (nTMS) technology, which allows for personalized, accurate, reproducible, and non-invasive brain stimulation. In May 2018, Nexstim launched its Navigated Brain Therapy (NBT ® ) system in the United States for the treatment of MDD, following FDA clearance in November 2017. Nexstim launched the NBS 6 system for therapy use in 2024. The NBS 6 is a new generation Nexstim system with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems are CE marked for the treatment of major depression and chronic pain, and have FDA approval for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Active commercial installed base of 116 therapy systems across four continents (including both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems and NBS systems with optional NBT ® add-on software installed). Research and Neuroscience Business The core of the Research and Neuroscience business is the sale of Nexstim systems and support and development services to leading research hospitals and clinics, in order to support leading expert customers (key opinion leaders, KOLs) working in these institutions at the forefront of technological and clinical development. The international research community is particularly interested in developing therapies based on the stimulation of connections/neural networks between different areas of the brain. Nexstim's unique electric field neuronavigation has proven to be particularly useful and necessary in this regard. TMS-EEG diagnostics and treatment development based on this methodology are a growing area of interest in research. Here, too, neuronavigation and Nexstim's real-time EEG (electroencephalography) software are particularly useful and are attracting growing interest.

The fashion and lifestyle market in the Nordics faced increasing headwinds during the quarter, as consumer demand continued to soften. Despite this, revenue on Booztlet.com increased by 14% (17% in local currency), driven by continued stock clearance. Boozt.com saw a 6% revenue decline (or 3% in local currency). While April and May were weak, with May experiencing the largest decline, trading significantly improved in June, with positive growth returning across all categories except Women's fashion. Approximately 300,000 new customers shopped across Boozt.com and Booztlet.com in Q2 2025, demonstrating the continued attractiveness of the platforms. Looking at active customers over the last 12 months, Booztlet.com saw a 19% increase, while Boozt.com's active customer base remained stable compared with Q2 2024. Adjusted EBIT was SEK 62 million (92) resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 3.4% (4.9%). The decline was primarily driven by a lower gross margin impacted by the clearance sales on Booztlet.com and the strengthening of the SEK. This was partially offset by improved fulfilment and admin cost ratios. Free cash flow in Q2 2025 significantly improved to SEK 186 million (from SEK 90 million in Q2 2024). Cash flow in the period benefited from effective inventory clearance during the quarter, as well as a repayment to Boozt related to wrongfully paid customs in Norway. This was partially offset by lower accounts payable. During Q2 2025, Boozt repurchased 1,099,000 own shares (or 1.7% of the total share capital) for SEK 94 million as part of the programme. Outlook The outlook for 2025 is unchanged, with expected net revenue growth of 0-6% and an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.5-5.5%. For the full year 2025, free cash flow is now expected to be minimum SEK 500 million, primarily driven by the continued normalization of inventory levels. Business update The Board of Directors has today given the mandate to initiate the process to expand the current share buyback programme to a total of SEK 300 million. The programme was originally launched in the quarter with an initial value of SEK 200 million. Following the AGM resolution on April 24, 2025, Boozt cancelled 2,680,517 repurchased ordinary shares, representing 3.9% of the total share capital. ESG: For the third year running, Boozt received the highest AAA rating in the 2025 MSCI ESG Ratings, affirming its global top-tier status and commitment to ESG reporting. Michael Bjergby has been appointed as the new Chief Financial Officer of the company and will assume the position on 1 September 2025. CEO comment ""The first six months of the year presented a challenging market, particularly with softer consumer demand in our major Nordic markets. Despite these conditions, our revenue in the first half was slightly up in local currency, which I believe is a testament to the resilience of our model. Our disciplined focus on cost efficiency and effective inventory management significantly improved free cash flow, reinforcing our strong financial position.

Published: 2025-08-15 07:56:57 CEST BioPorto A/S - Half Year financial report BioPorto Interim Result for the Second Quarter of 2025 - Continued progress with full execution of strategic objectives and strong NGAL sales growth. August 15, 2025 Announcement no. 19 BioPorto Interim Result for the Second Quarter of 2025 - Continued progress with full execution of strategic objectives and strong NGAL sales growth. Copenhagen, Denmark, August 15, 2025, (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – BioPorto A/S (“BioPorto” or the “Company”) (CPH:BIOPOR), today announced interim financial results for the second quarter of 2025 and a business update. Continued progress on key strategic milestones for the second quarter of 2025 Full execution of the objectives outlined in our February 2024 Strategic Plan. A major milestone in the second quarter of 2025 was the receipt of the first purchase order for ProNephro TM AKI (NGAL) for the US market, marking the first step in the commercial launch. The enrollment of patients in the US clinical cut-off study for ProNephro AKI (NGAL) for adult use is progressing as planned and is reaching the final phase. We maintain our goal to submit to the FDA by the end of 2026. Strong NGAL sales growth of 39% compared to the second quarter of 2024. The Board was restructured with Jens Due Olsen stepping in as Chairman and Carsten Buhl appointed as new CEO as of September 1, to drive the next growth phase. On April 15, 2025, the Company successfully completed a funding round of 25,000,000 new shares in a direct issue at market price providing gross proceeds of DKK 33.5 million. The funding round was met with strong support from existing shareholders. Peter Mørch Eriksen, BioPorto’s Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), comments: “The second quarter of 2025 marked a pivotal chapter for BioPorto, with the first US order of ProNephro AKI (NGAL) initiating our commercial journey and laying the foundation for a commercial platform to drive broad adoption of ProNephro AKI through strategic partnerships. We are pleased with the strong market momentum in the US and the progress in clinical studies toward the FDA submission by the end of 2026. With a clearly defined strategy and new leadership, we are well positioned to move into the next phase of our growth journey.” Financial highlights for the second quarter of 2025 Total revenue in the second quarter of 2025 totaled DKK 10.6 million, representing a 15% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by rising NGAL sales in both the US and the rest of the world (ROW). NGAL sales increased by 39% compared to the second quarter of 2024, driven by a 23% increase in the US and a substantial growth of 71% in the ROW, primarily due to a bulk order. EBITDA loss in the second quarter of 2025 amounted to DKK 18.4 million compared to DKK 16.2 million in the second quarter last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher costs associated with the adult clinical study. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s cash position was DKK 47.8 million compared to DKK 103.9 million in the same period last year. For the first half of 2025 total revenue amounted to DKK 18.3 million, representing a 2% decrease compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower Antibody sales due to timing in orders. NGAL sales rose by 5% compared to the first half of 2024, driven by a 22% increase in US NGAL sales. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 46.5 million, compared to DKK 31.5 million in the same period last year. Guidance Based on the results for the first half of 2025 and better visibility for the remainder of 2025, we narrow the full-year guidance for 2025. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of DKK 45-50 million (previously DKK 45-60 million). Sales for the rest of 2025 are still expected to be back-end loaded. Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of DKK 75-80 million (previously DKK 75-85 million).

The Company went through unification of its in-app marketplace, which was finalized by the end of July, leading to improved platform performance. The key figures for business development are as follows : IFRS, in EUR m H1 H1 Q2 Q2 Q2 2025 2024 2025 2024 ∆ Net Revenue 215.2 179.0 106.1 96.6 9.9% Adj. EBITDA 59.6 51.1 29.5 29.1 1.3% Adj.

Leverage Ratio (vs. 31.12.2024) 2.5 2.4 0.1 Cash & Cash Equivalents (vs. 31.12.2024) 161.0 146.7 9.7% Net Revenue increased 10 percent year-over-year, or 14 percent on a currency-adjusted basis, to EUR 106 million (Q2 2024: EUR 96 m) while Adjusted EBITDA of EUR 29 million was slightly up compared to the same period last year (Q2 2024: EUR 29 m). Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA Margin reduced slightly to 28 percent (Q2 2024: 30 percent). On the demand side, Verve recorded significant gains, with revenue up 82 percent. Growth was primarily driven by both a continued influx of new customers and successful scaling of existing client relationships. Synergies from the Jun Group acquisition, concluded in August 2024, continue to make an increasingly positive contribution to Group results. The expanded brand and agency sales teams delivered first measurable results in the quarter, strengthening Verve’s market coverage and supporting further growth in client demand. The most transformative operational step taken in recent quarters has been the unification of all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform, with the integration process completed in July 2025. The migration to one technology stack, following years of intense planning and systems development, marks a major leap forward in structural efficiency and operational performance. “By eliminating costly duplication and data fragmentation from multiple legacy systems, Verve is now ideally positioned to drive further scale, optimize data flows, and enhance performance across the network”, explains Remco Westermann, CEO of Verve Group SE. “However, this strategic transition was not without challenges. The technical migration proved to be much more demanding than initially expected, leading to short-term operational issues including scaling, load balancer performance, and temporary interruptions in bidding volumes.” The technical challenges, which relate solely to platform unification of in-app marketplace activities on the supply side, have turned out to be much more demanding than anticipated in the extensive planning process of the project. In particular, noticeable delays in the onboarding of new customers meant that incremental new revenues could only be realized with considerable delays. Various technical issues in relation to load balancer performance, temporary interruptions in bidding volumes, and temporary asynchrony of AI algorithms, led to revenue reductions during the unification process. The process of unifying all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform has now, however, been completed in July, which will lead to significantly improved platform performance, cost efficiency and scaling going forward. The recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities has proven slower than expected, as observed in onboarding of new customers and customer scaling. As a result, supply-side net revenues were down -3 percent year-over-year. Management considers these effects as temporary, with most issues resolved by the end of the quarter and supply-side revenues further recovering and already approaching the previous year’s Q3 performance. Despite these headwinds, Verve’s KPIs point to a fundamentally healthy business development. The Company grew its total number of software clients organically by almost 10 percent, while maintaining existing clients with an all-time high client retention rate of 98 percent, underlining high customer satisfaction. Thanks to sustained strong customer growth and this continued high retention, an 8 percent reduction in ad spend by existing customer base led to only a 4 percent decrease in organic performance year on year. Higher infrastructure expenses and one-off support costs related to the unification process had an additional adverse impact on Adjusted EBITDA. Nevertheless, the slight increase during the platform migration reflects disciplined expense management. As new capabilities from the unified platform are leveraged and ramp-up effects dissipate, further margin improvement is expected in the coming quarters. Having completed the platform unification of its largest revenue driver in-app in July, platform performance has improved considerably. The new combined platforms are continuously enhanced and onboarding of new customers has been resumed, which will lead to increased revenues and improved margins in the second half of the year. The supply side platform unifications for other formats, such as CTV, will conclude within the coming quarters and are expected to have only minor impacts on upcoming results. Outlook The further expansion of the sales team, with increased headcount and stronger segment focus, is already starting to contribute to growth. Despite the slight pressure seen in the market during Q2, historical trends show advertising budgets typically rebound swiftly following temporary contractions. Since mid-June, market sentiment has stabilized and continues to stabilize further into Q3. As published, the Company has reduced its outlook for the full year 2025. In terms of net revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The revised outlook entails a net revenue range of EUR 485 to 515 million (previously EUR 530 to 565 million) and an adjusted EBITDA of range of EUR 125 to 140 million (previously EUR 155 to 175 million). The downward revision of the forecast is due to two factors, which stand in contrast to the development anticipated in the original outlook. First, a one-off impact from more severe technical issues arising from the platform unification leading to direct revenue impacts, and in particular prolonged recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities after the completion of technical unification. Secondly, the Company sees significantly stronger negative FX translation impacts as well as outlook than Management previously anticipated In order to give existing and interested investors an even better understanding of Verve Group SE's technologically sophisticated business model, the Company will host a Capital Markets Day on 19 August, starting at 10:00 CEST. The Capital Markets Day will be hosted as a hybrid event, live in Stockholm and online as interactive webcast. During the event, Verve will present its interim report for the first half of 2025 as well as a commercial update on the Company’s strategic roadmap for the upcoming quarters.

The Company went through unification of its in-app marketplace, which was finalized by the end of July, leading to improved platform performance. The key figures for business development are as follows : IFRS, in EUR m H1 H1 Q2 Q2 Q2 2025 2024 2025 2024 ∆ Net Revenue 215.2 179.0 106.1 96.6 9.9% Adj. EBITDA 59.6 51.1 29.5 29.1 1.3% Adj.

Leverage Ratio (vs. 31.12.2024) 2.5 2.4 0.1 Cash & Cash Equivalents (vs. 31.12.2024) 161.0 146.7 9.7% Net Revenue increased 10 percent year-over-year, or 14 percent on a currency-adjusted basis, to EUR 106 million (Q2 2024: EUR 96 m) while Adjusted EBITDA of EUR 29 million was slightly up compared to the same period last year (Q2 2024: EUR 29 m). Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA Margin reduced slightly to 28 percent (Q2 2024: 30 percent). On the demand side, Verve recorded significant gains, with revenue up 82 percent. Growth was primarily driven by both a continued influx of new customers and successful scaling of existing client relationships. Synergies from the Jun Group acquisition, concluded in August 2024, continue to make an increasingly positive contribution to Group results. The expanded brand and agency sales teams delivered first measurable results in the quarter, strengthening Verve’s market coverage and supporting further growth in client demand. The most transformative operational step taken in recent quarters has been the unification of all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform, with the integration process completed in July 2025. The migration to one technology stack, following years of intense planning and systems development, marks a major leap forward in structural efficiency and operational performance. “By eliminating costly duplication and data fragmentation from multiple legacy systems, Verve is now ideally positioned to drive further scale, optimize data flows, and enhance performance across the network”, explains Remco Westermann, CEO of Verve Group SE. “However, this strategic transition was not without challenges. The technical migration proved to be much more demanding than initially expected, leading to short-term operational issues including scaling, load balancer performance, and temporary interruptions in bidding volumes.” The technical challenges, which relate solely to platform unification of in-app marketplace activities on the supply side, have turned out to be much more demanding than anticipated in the extensive planning process of the project. In particular, noticeable delays in the onboarding of new customers meant that incremental new revenues could only be realized with considerable delays. Various technical issues in relation to load balancer performance, temporary interruptions in bidding volumes, and temporary asynchrony of AI algorithms, led to revenue reductions during the unification process. The process of unifying all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform has now, however, been completed in July, which will lead to significantly improved platform performance, cost efficiency and scaling going forward. The recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities has proven slower than expected, as observed in onboarding of new customers and customer scaling. As a result, supply-side net revenues were down -3 percent year-over-year. Management considers these effects as temporary, with most issues resolved by the end of the quarter and supply-side revenues further recovering and already approaching the previous year’s Q3 performance. Despite these headwinds, Verve’s KPIs point to a fundamentally healthy business development. The Company grew its total number of software clients organically by almost 10 percent, while maintaining existing clients with an all-time high client retention rate of 98 percent, underlining high customer satisfaction. Thanks to sustained strong customer growth and this continued high retention, an 8 percent reduction in ad spend by existing customer base led to only a 4 percent decrease in organic performance year on year. Higher infrastructure expenses and one-off support costs related to the unification process had an additional adverse impact on Adjusted EBITDA. Nevertheless, the slight increase during the platform migration reflects disciplined expense management. As new capabilities from the unified platform are leveraged and ramp-up effects dissipate, further margin improvement is expected in the coming quarters. Having completed the platform unification of its largest revenue driver in-app in July, platform performance has improved considerably. The new combined platforms are continuously enhanced and onboarding of new customers has been resumed, which will lead to increased revenues and improved margins in the second half of the year. The supply side platform unifications for other formats, such as CTV, will conclude within the coming quarters and are expected to have only minor impacts on upcoming results. Outlook The further expansion of the sales team, with increased headcount and stronger segment focus, is already starting to contribute to growth. Despite the slight pressure seen in the market during Q2, historical trends show advertising budgets typically rebound swiftly following temporary contractions. Since mid-June, market sentiment has stabilized and continues to stabilize further into Q3. As published, the Company has reduced its outlook for the full year 2025. In terms of net revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The revised outlook entails a net revenue range of EUR 485 to 515 million (previously EUR 530 to 565 million) and an adjusted EBITDA of range of EUR 125 to 140 million (previously EUR 155 to 175 million). The downward revision of the forecast is due to two factors, which stand in contrast to the development anticipated in the original outlook. First, a one-off impact from more severe technical issues arising from the platform unification leading to direct revenue impacts, and in particular prolonged recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities after the completion of technical unification. Secondly, the Company sees significantly stronger negative FX translation impacts as well as outlook than Management previously anticipated In order to give existing and interested investors an even better understanding of Verve Group SE's technologically sophisticated business model, the Company will host a Capital Markets Day on 19 August, starting at 10:00 CEST. The Capital Markets Day will be hosted as a hybrid event, live in Stockholm and online as interactive webcast.

The Company went through unification of its in-app marketplace, which was finalized by the end of July, leading to improved platform performance. The key figures for business development are as follows : IFRS, in EUR m H1 H1 Q2 Q2 Q2 2025 2024 2025 2024 ∆ Net Revenue 215.2 179.0 106.1 96.6 9.9% Adj. EBITDA 59.6 51.1 29.5 29.1 1.3% Adj.

Leverage Ratio (vs. 31.12.2024) 2.5 2.4 0.1 Cash & Cash Equivalents (vs. 31.12.2024) 161.0 146.7 9.7% Net Revenue increased 10 percent year-over-year, or 14 percent on a currency-adjusted basis, to EUR 106 million (Q2 2024: EUR 96 m) while Adjusted EBITDA of EUR 29 million was slightly up compared to the same period last year (Q2 2024: EUR 29 m). Accordingly, the Adjusted EBITDA Margin reduced slightly to 28 percent (Q2 2024: 30 percent). On the demand side, Verve recorded significant gains, with revenue up 82 percent. Growth was primarily driven by both a continued influx of new customers and successful scaling of existing client relationships. Synergies from the Jun Group acquisition, concluded in August 2024, continue to make an increasingly positive contribution to Group results. The expanded brand and agency sales teams delivered first measurable results in the quarter, strengthening Verve’s market coverage and supporting further growth in client demand. The most transformative operational step taken in recent quarters has been the unification of all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform, with the integration process completed in July 2025. The migration to one technology stack, following years of intense planning and systems development, marks a major leap forward in structural efficiency and operational performance. “By eliminating costly duplication and data fragmentation from multiple legacy systems, Verve is now ideally positioned to drive further scale, optimize data flows, and enhance performance across the network”, explains Remco Westermann, CEO of Verve Group SE. “However, this strategic transition was not without challenges. The technical migration proved to be much more demanding than initially expected, leading to short-term operational issues including scaling, load balancer performance, and temporary interruptions in bidding volumes.” The technical challenges, which relate solely to platform unification of in-app marketplace activities on the supply side, have turned out to be much more demanding than anticipated in the extensive planning process of the project. In particular, noticeable delays in the onboarding of new customers meant that incremental new revenues could only be realized with considerable delays. Various technical issues in relation to load balancer performance, temporary interruptions in bidding volumes, and temporary asynchrony of AI algorithms, led to revenue reductions during the unification process. The process of unifying all in-app marketplace activities onto a single platform has now, however, been completed in July, which will lead to significantly improved platform performance, cost efficiency and scaling going forward. The recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities has proven slower than expected, as observed in onboarding of new customers and customer scaling. As a result, supply-side net revenues were down -3 percent year-over-year. Management considers these effects as temporary, with most issues resolved by the end of the quarter and supply-side revenues further recovering and already approaching the previous year’s Q3 performance. Despite these headwinds, Verve’s KPIs point to a fundamentally healthy business development. The Company grew its total number of software clients organically by almost 10 percent, while maintaining existing clients with an all-time high client retention rate of 98 percent, underlining high customer satisfaction. Thanks to sustained strong customer growth and this continued high retention, an 8 percent reduction in ad spend by existing customer base led to only a 4 percent decrease in organic performance year on year. Higher infrastructure expenses and one-off support costs related to the unification process had an additional adverse impact on Adjusted EBITDA. Nevertheless, the slight increase during the platform migration reflects disciplined expense management. As new capabilities from the unified platform are leveraged and ramp-up effects dissipate, further margin improvement is expected in the coming quarters. Having completed the platform unification of its largest revenue driver in-app in July, platform performance has improved considerably. The new combined platforms are continuously enhanced and onboarding of new customers has been resumed, which will lead to increased revenues and improved margins in the second half of the year. The supply side platform unifications for other formats, such as CTV, will conclude within the coming quarters and are expected to have only minor impacts on upcoming results. Outlook The further expansion of the sales team, with increased headcount and stronger segment focus, is already starting to contribute to growth. Despite the slight pressure seen in the market during Q2, historical trends show advertising budgets typically rebound swiftly following temporary contractions. Since mid-June, market sentiment has stabilized and continues to stabilize further into Q3. As published, the Company has reduced its outlook for the full year 2025. In terms of net revenue and adjusted EBITDA. The revised outlook entails a net revenue range of EUR 485 to 515 million (previously EUR 530 to 565 million) and an adjusted EBITDA of range of EUR 125 to 140 million (previously EUR 155 to 175 million). The downward revision of the forecast is due to two factors, which stand in contrast to the development anticipated in the original outlook. First, a one-off impact from more severe technical issues arising from the platform unification leading to direct revenue impacts, and in particular prolonged recovery in revenue intake from supply side marketplace activities after the completion of technical unification. Secondly, the Company sees significantly stronger negative FX translation impacts as well as outlook than Management previously anticipated In order to give existing and interested investors an even better understanding of Verve Group SE's technologically sophisticated business model, the Company will host a Capital Markets Day on 19 August, starting at 10:00 CEST. The Capital Markets Day will be hosted as a hybrid event, live in Stockholm and online as interactive webcast. During the event, Verve will present its interim report for the first half of 2025 as well as a commercial update on the Company’s strategic roadmap for the upcoming quarters.

Q2 2025 organic growth ended at 8%. Like-for-like (LFL) was 3% and network expansion added 5% to growth. LFL growth in the US remained strong at 8%, and Rest of Pandora was robust at 6%. Despite some challenges in the four European markets disclosed separately, overall LFL in Europe was 1% fuelled by double-digit growth in several countries, including for example Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Poland. The gross margin remained strong at 79.3% despite 170bp headwind from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs (80.2% in Q2 2024). Pricing and cost efficiencies continued to contribute positively. The Q2 2025 EBIT margin landed at 18.2%. The margin declined by 160bp Y/Y reflecting 230bp of headwinds from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs. In constant currency, the EBIT margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025. Reported EPS growth in Q2 2025 was 6% (18% in constant currency). PHOENIX STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS To position Pandora as a full jewellery brand, Pandora continues to invest across all four strategy pillars: brand, design, markets and personalisation. A number of key strategic initiatives are lined up for H2 2025, including an exciting product pipeline with two new collections, Pandora Talisman and Minis, that refresh the core charms & carriers offering with new styles whilst also strengthening the affordability position. Pandora is preparing a new chapter of the “BE LOVE” marketing campaign with a holiday campaign that deepens emotional connection through storytelling, anchored in Pandora’s brand DNA. Additionally, in selected markets, Pandora will invest behind locally relevant talent, strengthening cultural resonance and boosting social engagement to inspire consumers. Pandora’s full jewellery brand message continues to resonate with consumers and is visible in the numbers with LFL growth in the “Core” segment in Q2 of 1% whilst the “Fuel with more” segment drove 5% LFL growth. Despite 30bp further headwind from commodity prices and foreign exchange since the Q1 2025 report, Pandora remains on track towards the target of an EBIT margin of “around 25%” in 2026 (excl. tariffs). The current tariff level adds 120bp headwind in 2026 and Pandora currently expects to deliver “at least 24%” EBIT margin incl. tariffs. 2025 GUIDANCE AND CURRENT TRADING Pandora maintains the guidance for 2025 of “7-8% organic growth” while noting the elevated macro uncertainty. The EBIT margin guidance for 2025 is also maintained at “around 24%” despite including the 60bp headwind based on current tariff levels. Current trading in July has seen LFL growth at around 2%. This has been negatively impacted by a) a weak End of Season Sale and b) the timing of product launches with PANDORA ESSENCE being launched in May 2024 while Talisman/Minis will be launched at the end of Q3 2025. Alexander Lacik, President and CEO of Pandora, says: “In these turbulent times, we are satisfied with yet another quarter of high single-digit organic growth and strong profitability. The results show that our brand and unique storytelling proposition continue to attract more consumers and that our global footprint enables us to balance ups and downs across the markets. Despite the macroeconomic challenges to top and bottom line, we are confident that we will deliver on our targets for the year driven by an exciting product pipeline, new marketing campaigns and operational agility.” DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 FY 2024 FY 2025 guidance Revenue 7,075 6,771 14,421 13,605 31,680 Organic growth 8% 15% 7% 16% 13% 7-8% Like-for-Like, % 3% 8% 4% 9% 7% Operating profit (EBIT) 1,287 1,338 2,928 2,845 7,974 EBIT margin, % 18.2% 19.8% 20.3% 20.9% 25.2% Around 24% Attachments Pandora Q2 2025 Interim Report Company Announcement_No_965 Pandora Appendix Company Announcement Q2 2025 Attachments: Pandora Appendix Company Announcement Q2 2025.xlsx Pandora Q2 2025 Interim Report Company Announcement_No_965.pdf This email message was delivered to Cancel this subscription This news release was distributed by Company News System, nasdaq.com/european-market-activity/news/company-news"

Resultatet efter skatter var 4,8 Meur (1,8 Meur). JANUARI-JUNI 2025 (jämfört med januari–juni 2024) Omsättningen uppgick till 215,8 Meur (219,1 Meur). Övriga rörelseintäkter var 0,6 Meur (0,6 Meur).

Styrelsen har på sitt ordinarie möte den 14 augusti 2025 i enlighet med den ordinarie bolagsstämmans befullmäktigande av den 24 april 2025 beslutat att dela ut en andra rat dividend om 50 cent per aktie, totalt 8,6 Meur med avstämningsdag 18 augusti 2025 och utbetalningsdag 25 augusti 2025. En betydande osäkerhet föreligger som en följd av den ekonomiska nedgången i vårt trafikområde under de senaste åren, vilket har påverkat kundernas konsumtionsmönster negativt. Till osäkerheten bidrar även det rådande geopolitiska läget och dess potentiella inverkan på främst energipriserna. Denna osäkerhet gör det svårt att förutse den passagerarrelaterade marknadsutvecklingen. Styrelsen bedömer att resultatet före skatter för 2025 kommer att vara i nivå med 2024, vilket är samma slutsats som vid senaste rapporttillfälle. VD JAN HANSES KOMMENTERAR Resultatutvecklingen under årets andra kvartal var starkare än under motsvarande period föregående år. Resultatförbättringen har förstärkts under kvartalets samtliga månader. Således har vår förväntan avseende en resultatförbättring under april-juni infriats om än fortsättningsvis på blygsamma nivåer. Efterfrågeutvecklingen har varit svagt positiv, men den positiva utvecklingen försköts, såsom vi varnade för i föregående kvartalsrapport. Den svaga ekonomiska utvecklingen i vårt trafikområde medför en fortsatt försiktig inställning bland konsumenterna. Halvårsresultatet belastas fortsättningsvis av dockningarna av Gabriella och Viking XPRS, men vi förväntar oss en fortsatt stärkt resultatutveckling så att ett helårsresultat i nivå med fjolåret kan nås. Efterfrågan under högsäsongsmånaderna juli och augusti prognosticeras vara god, medan utsikterna för hösten är osäkra. Vårt Joint Venture-bolag, Gotland Alandia Cruises, påverkas av samma marknadsförutsättningar som gäller för vår övriga trafik och resultatet uppnår ännu inte helt våra förväntningar, men samma trend som gäller för den övriga trafiken kan förväntas även här. Från januari belastas resultatet även av höjda farledsavgifter i Finland som en följd av att den halvering av avgifterna som genomfördes i samband med implementeringen av det så kallade svaveldirektivet nu återtogs. Ytterligare uppbärs från årets början även höjda avgifter från EU:s utsläppshandelssystem som numera motsvarar 70 procent av ett fullt implementerat utsläppshandelssystem. Vår verksamhet påverkas för tillfället mycket av kommande miljönormer och vi påförs en kostnadsbelastning som på medellång sikt enbart delvis kan mitigeras genom fortsatt arbete med energieffektiviteten. Tillgången på alternativa bränslen för sjöfarten är fortsatt dålig. Sammanfattningsvis kan jag konstatera att det första halvåret 2025 har präglats av ett förhållandevis tungt dockningsprogram och en utmanande marknadssituation, där vi hoppas på en förändring under tredje kvartalet. Jag vill rikta ett varmt tack till våra kunder och samarbetspartners för visat förtroende och ett gott samarbete. Ett stort tack går även till vår personal som medverkat till att vi uppnått rekordhöga kundnöjdhetsvärden.

Birka Gotland, som Viking Line äger tillsammans med Gotlandsbolaget, hade ett planerat trafikuppehåll under perioden 6 till 15 januari. Från och med 19 juni till 10 augusti gör fartygen Gabriella och Viking Cinderella anlöp via Tallinn under sin ordinarie trafik på linjen Helsingfors–Mariehamn–Stockholm. Under juni månad gjorde dessa fartyg även ett antal destinationskryssningar till Visby från Helsingfors. Under jämförelseperioden, den 20 mars 2024, inledde det samägda fartyget Birka Gotland sin kryssningstrafik från Stockholm. Inför trafikstarten genomfördes en större dockning och uppgradering av fartyget. Under jämförelseperioden dockades även Viking Cinderella och Viking Glory. Efter dockningen av Cinderella avfördes hon ur det svenska fartygsregistret och infördes i det åländska fartygsregistret. Antalet passagerare på koncernens helägda fartyg uppgick under perioden till 2 003 861 (2 062 271). Koncernen hade en total marknadsandel inom trafikområdet om uppskattningsvis 31,6 % (33,0 %). Antalet passagerare på Birka Gotland uppgick till 255 930 (139 062 perioden 20 mars-30 juni 2024). Passagerarvolymen minskade i jämförelse med föregående års motsvarande period vilket sammanhänger med dockningar och linjebyten av fartyg vilka ger jämförelsestörande effekter under perioden. Kryssningsefterfrågan har därtill varit fluktuerande, särskilt till linjen Åbo-Åland-Stockholm, vilket huvudsakligen förklaras av det dämpade ekonomiska läget på huvudmarknaderna Finland och Sverige. Efterfrågan under perioden har dock varit i nivå med fjolåret. Passagerarvolymerna mellan Finland och Sverige ökade drivet av en högre turfrekvens där Cinderella trafikerade på linjen Helsingfors-Mariehamn-Stockholm merparten av perioden. Marknaden mellan Finland och Estland var stabil. Viking Lines marknadsandel i trafiken mellan Finland och Sverige ökade till 60,8 % (59,7 %). I trafiken mellan Finland och Estland minskade marknadsandelen något vilket främst berodde på att Viking XPRS dockades under inledningen av året Koncernens totala fraktvolymer uppgick till 71 324 fraktenheter (66 385). Koncernens fraktmarknadsandel uppskattades till 19,5 % (16,8 %). Viking Lines positiva trend med fraktvolymutvecklingen håller i sig, trots en sjunkande marknad inom vårt trafikområde – delvis tack vare vår biogasprodukt ”Green Shipping on Demand” vars utveckling gått bättre än förväntat. Utöver den positiva volymtrenden ha vi nu även märkt något förbättrad balans i trafiken som förhoppningsvis är ett tecken på att Finlands ekonomi håller på att återhämta sig. Den internationella transportmarknaden rapporterar om förbättrade utsikter för hösten när de olika projekten inom energiomställning börjar verkställas och sjunkande räntor medför ökade aktiviteter inom byggandet. Marknadsandelen för personbilar uppgick till uppskattningsvis 26,5 % (28,5 %). Den långvariga geopolitiska oron i omvärlden fortsätter skapa osäkerhet kring efterfrågeutvecklingen framöver, både inom passagerar- och fraktmarknaden. OMSÄTTNING OCH RESULTAT FÖR JANUARI – JUNI 2025 Koncernens omsättning minskade med 1,5 % till 215,8 Meur under perioden 1 januari–30 juni 2025 (219,1 Meur 1 januari–30 juni 2024). Rörelseresultatet uppgick till -11,2 Meur (-4,3 Meur). Koncernens resultat före skatter uppgick till -17,2 Meur (-12,4 Meur). Försämringen jämfört med samma period föregående år är främst hänförlig till det första kvartalet, då två fartyg var ur trafik för planerade dockningar. Detta påverkade passagerarvolymerna och därmed intäkterna negativt. Resultatet för det första halvåret är svagare än 2024 och speglar även en fortsatt osäkerhet i omvärlden, inklusive efterfrågeutveckling och geopolitisk oro. De passagerarrelaterade intäkterna minskade med 2,3 % till 188,0 Meur (192,3 Meur), medan fraktintäkterna ökade med 6,1 % till 26,7 Meur (25,2 Meur) och övriga intäkter var 1,1 Meur (1,6 Meur). Försäljningsbidraget var 169,7 Meur (170,4 Meur). Driftskostnaderna ökade med 3,5 % till 165,8 Meur (160,2 Meur), varav kostnaderna för utsläppsrätter var 2,7 Meur (1,6 Meur). Kostnader för löner och anställningsförmåner ökade med 3,7 % eller 2,2 Meur, där den största delen av ökningen beror på att Viking Line bemannar Birka Gotland med servicepersonal. Övriga rörelsekostnader ökade med 3,4 % eller 3,4 Meur. Ökade kostnader för utsläppsrätter, höjda farledsavgifter och kostnader för reparationer och underhåll under dockningarna står för en stor del av ökningen. I övriga rörelsekostnader ingår även återbetalning av trafikstöd som erhölls under pandemiåren om 1,1 Meur. OMSÄTTNING OCH RESULTAT FÖR ANDRA KVARTALET 2025 Koncernens omsättning ökade med 2,0 % till 128,4 Meur under perioden 1 april– 30 juni 2025 (125,9 Meur 1 april–30 juni 2024). Rörelseresultatet uppgick till 6,9 Meur (6,2 Meur). Omsättningsökningen under andra kvartalet påverkades positivt av att påsken inföll i april i år, vilket bidrog till ett ökat resande under perioden jämfört med föregående år då påsken inföll i mars. De passagerarrelaterade intäkterna ökade med 2,4 % till 115,3 Meur (112,6 Meur), medan fraktintäkterna var 12,6 Meur (12,5 Meur) och övriga intäkter 0,5 Meur (0,8 Meur). Försäljningsbidraget var 100,9 Meur (98,7 Meur). Driftskostnaderna ökade med 1,4 % till 86,3 Meur (85,1 Meur). Kostnaderna för löner och anställningsförmåner ökade med 4,8 % eller 1,5 Meur medan övriga rörelsekostnader minskade med 0,7 % eller 0,3 Meur. INVESTERING OCH FINANSIERING Koncernens investeringar uppgick för perioden 1 januari till 30 juni 2025 till 12,4 Meur (15,4 Meur). Koncernens totala investeringar utgjorde 5,8 % av omsättningen (7,0 %). En betydande del av investeringarna avser dockningarna av Gabriella och Viking XPRS, medan en väsentlig andel har riktats till inköp av utsläppsrätter, vilka redovisas som immateriella tillgångar. Jämförelseårets investeringar bestod huvudsakligen av investeringar i samband med dockningarna av Viking Cinderella och det med Gotlandsbolaget samägda fartyget Birka Gotland. Koncernens långfristiga räntebärande skulder uppgick den 30 juni 2025 till 112,0 Meur (133,1 Meur). Noteras kan i sammanhanget att koncernens kredit relaterat till finansiering av Viking Grace återbetalades i sin helhet i januari 2025. Soliditeten var 51,9 % jämfört med 48,9 % föregående år. Koncernens likvida medel uppgick vid utgången av juni till 41,5 Meur (58,0 Meur). Beviljade outnyttjade kreditlimiter i koncernen uppgick till 22,1 Meur (22,1 Meur). Affärsverksamhetens nettokassaflöde uppgick till 23,7 Meur (23,3 Meur). Nettokassaflödet från investeringar var -9,6 Meur (-13,6 Meur) och nettokassaflödet från finansiering uppgick till -28,4 Meur (-37,0 Meur). Koncernens låneavtal innehåller marknadsmässiga lånekovenanter. De finansiella kovenanterna i låneavtalen består av minimikrav på likvida medel och soliditet samt maximal nivå på koncernens totala finansiella nettoskulder i förhållande till EBITDA. Den utdelningsbegränsning som finns i ett av koncernens låneavtal gäller framledes ifall koncernens skuldsättning i förhållande till EBITDA överstiger förhållandet 5,0. Koncernens skuldsättning i förhållande till EBITDA understiger förhållandet 5,0, varför inte utdelningsbegränsningen är i kraft. ORGANISATION OCH PERSONAL Medelantalet anställda omräknat i heltidstjänster i koncernen var 2 375 (2 305), varav i moderbolaget 1 946 (1 848). Landpersonalens antal var 453 (459) och sjöpersonalens 1 922 (1 846). 294 personer (193) anställda i ett av Viking Line Abp:s dotterbolag har under perioden varit uthyrda till joint venture bolaget Gotland Alandia Cruises AB, som bedriver kryssningstrafik med fartyget Birka Gotland. Den personal som hyrts ut av Viking Line har i huvudsak varit servicepersonal. Under jämförelseperioden flaggades Viking Cinderella om från svensk till finsk flagg. RISKFAKTORER Viking Lines verksamhet är utsatt för risker av olika slag, med varierande omfattning och effekt på verksamheten, ekonomiska resultat samt företagets förmåga att uppfylla vissa sociala och miljömässiga mål. De relevanta riskerna har klassificerats under fyra kategorier: strategiska, operativa, skade- och finansiella risker. Dessa risker kvarstår och är oförändrade sedan årsbokslutet publicerades. Under innevarande räkenskapsperiod 2025 arbetar Viking Line med att utöka klassificeringen med en kategori för klimatrisker. Viking Line identifierar och hanterar klimatrisker som en integrerad del av bolagets övergripande riskhanteringsarbete. Under 2025 har arbetet formaliserats ytterligare för att beakta kraven i EU:s direktiv om hållbarhetsrapportering (CSRD). Arbetet syftar till att säkra långsiktig konkurrenskraft, uppfylla regulatoriska krav och bidra till omställningen till en mer hållbar sjöfart. Klimatrisker bedöms utifrån två huvudkategorier: Fysiska risker, såsom stormar, stigande havsnivåer och förändrade väderförhållanden som kan påverka fartyg, hamninfrastruktur, personal och försörjningskedjor. Övergångsrisker, såsom, teknologiska, politiska och marknadsmässiga förändringar som uppstår i omställningen till en koldioxidsnål ekonomi. Bolagets räntebärande skulder uppgick till 133,8 Meur per 30 juni 2025, av vilka 91,8 % har en rörlig ränta. Den totala rörliga räntan utgörs av marknadsräntan och en företagsspecifik marginal. Fluktuerande räntenivåer har en effekt på bolagets finansieringskostnader och kan påverka kostnaderna för finansiering i framtiden. Gällande eftergranskningen av de trafikstöd som passagerarfartygsrederierna som trafikerade Finland, erhöll under pandemiåren 2020-2022, har Viking Line sedan årsbokslutet informerats om att återbetalning kan komma att krävas. Hittills har Viking Line återbetalat 1,1 Meur. Omfattning och tidpunkt för eventuella ytterligare återbetalningar är ännu inte fastställda. UTSIKTER FÖR VERKSAMHETSÅRET 2025 En betydande osäkerhet föreligger som en följd av den ekonomiska nedgången i vårt trafikområde under de senaste åren, vilket har påverkat kundernas konsumtionsmönster negativt. Till osäkerheten bidrar även det rådande geopolitiska läget och dess potentiella inverkan på främst energipriserna. Denna osäkerhet gör det svårt att förutse den passagerarrelaterade marknadsutvecklingen. Styrelsen bedömer att resultatet före skatter för 2025 kommer att vara i nivå med 2024, vilket är samma slutsats som vid senaste rapporttillfälle. HÄNDELSER EFTER BALANSDAGEN Styrelsen har på sitt ordinarie möte den 14 augusti 2025 i enlighet med den ordinarie bolagsstämmans befullmäktigande av den 24 april 2025 beslutat att dela ut en andra rat dividend om 50 cent per aktie, totalt 8,6 Meur med avstämningsdag 18 augusti 2025 och utbetalningsdag 25 augusti 2025. Styrelsen känner inte till några övriga händelser efter balansdagen som skulle kunna påverka halvårsrapporten. Mariehamn den 14 augusti 2025 VIKING LINE ABP Styrelsen Finansiella uppgifter Styrelsens halvårsrapport är sammanställd i enlighet med IFRS-redovisningsstandardernas bokförings- och värderingsprinciper. De tillämpade redovisnings- och beräkningsprinciperna är samma som i bokslutet för år 2024. Siffrorna är oreviderade.

Redovisningsprinciper Denna halvårsrapport är upprättad i enlighet med IFRS-redovisningsstandardernas bokförings- och värderingsprinciper och är uppgjord som ett sammandrag av bokslutet för perioden i enlighet med IAS 34. Halvårsrapporten är upprättad enligt samma redovisningsprinciper, uppskattningar och värderingar som i det senaste årsbokslutet, om inte annat framgår nedan. Halvårsrapporten är inte reviderad. Vid avrundningen till miljoner euro kan avrundningsdifferenser på +/- 0,1 Meur uppstå. 2. Uppskattningar och bedömningar Vid upprättandet av koncernbokslutet i enlighet med IFRS redovisningsstandarder måste företagsledningen göra bedömningar och uppskattningar om framtiden som påverkar de redovisade beloppen för tillgångar och skulder, intäkter och kostnader samt övrig information. De bedömningar och uppskattningar som bokslutet innehåller bygger på ledningens bästa uppfattning vid tidpunkten för publicering av bokslutet. En betydande osäkerhet har förelegat som en följd av den ekonomiska nedgången i vårt trafikområde som helhet, vilket har påverkat kundernas konsumtionsmönster negativt. Till osäkerheten bidrar även det rådande geopolitiska läget och dess potentiella inverkan på främst energipriserna. Det är svårt att bedöma hur osäkerheten kommer att påverka och vilka effekter det får för Viking Lines framtida resultat, finansiella ställning och kassaflöde. Det verkliga utfallet kan avvika från uppgjorda uppskattningar och bedömningar. Det viktigaste området som innebär bedömningar är värderingen av koncernens fartyg. Marknadsvärderingar görs regelbundet av externa värderare. Fartygens restvärden och beräknade nyttjandeperioder granskas årligen och justeras om de avviker väsentligt från tidigare värden. Vid värderingen av koncernens leasingavtal görs bedömningar huruvida koncernen kommer att utnyttja eventuell möjlighet att förlänga avtalets leasingperiod eller att säga upp avtalet. Bedömningar görs även av vilka diskonteringsräntor som ska användas vid nuvärdesberäkningarna av koncernens leasingskuld. Storleken på koncernens leasingskulder och nyttjanderätter, samt även amorteringar av leasingskulderna och avskrivningar av nyttjanderätterna, påverkas av ovanstående bedömningar. 3. Likviditet och risker Koncernens likvida medel uppgick vid utgången av juni till 41,5 Meur (58,0 Meur). Beviljade outnyttjade kreditlimiter i koncernen uppgick till 22,1 Meur per 30 juni 2025 (22,1 Meur). Affärsverksamhetens nettokassaflöde uppgick till 23,7 Meur (23,3 Meur). Nettokassaflödet från investeringar var -9,6 Meur (-13,6 Meur) och nettokassaflödet från finansiering uppgick till -28,4 Meur (-37,0 Meur). Koncernens låneavtal innehåller marknadsmässiga lånekovenanter. De finansiella kovenanterna i låneavtalen består av minimikrav på likvida medel och soliditet samt maximal nivå på koncernens totala finansiella nettoskulder i förhållande till EBITDA. Dessa lånekovenanter har under perioden varit inom de ställda kraven. Bolagets förmåga att uppfylla de krav som ställs i befintliga finansieringsavtal beror på bolagets förmåga att generera kassaflöde från sin verksamhet, vilket delvis beror på faktorer som är utom bolagets kontroll. Det finns en risk, om den ekonomiska nedgången i Finland och det geopolitiska läget förvärras och energipriserna stiger väsentligt att bolaget inte kan generera ett tillräckligt kassaflöde eller erhålla ytterligare finansiering för att uppfylla sina förpliktelser i enlighet med finansieringsavtalen. För att något motverka risken för höjda bunkerpriser har koncernen ingått fastprisavtal avseende delar av MDO förbrukningen för juli-december 2025. Gällande eftergranskningen av de trafikstöd som passagerarfartygsrederierna som trafikerade Finland, erhöll under pandemiåren 2020-2022, har Viking Line sedan årsbokslutet informerats om att återbetalning kan komma att krävas. Hittills har Viking Line återbetalat 1,1 Meur. Omfattning och tidpunkt för eventuella ytterligare återbetalningar är ännu inte fastställda. Från och med 1 januari 2024 har sjöfarten inkluderats i EU:s handelssystem för växthusgaser (ETS). ETS är ett av styrmedlen som EU använder för att nå de egna klimatmålen och internationella åtaganden inom Parisavtalet. Viking Line är förpliktigat att för utsläppen från med 1 januari 2024 överlämna utsläppsrätter för flottans växthusgasutsläpp till aktuell tillsynsmyndighet. Det första överlämnandet ska ske senast den 30 september 2025. Viking Line har under året köpt utsläppsrätter kontinuerligt för att minska prisrisken. Innehav av utsläppsrätter binder kapital och påverkar likviditeten negativt. FuelEU Maritime-förordningen trädde i kraft från och med 1 januari 2025. Förordningens avsikt är att öka andelen förnybara- och lågutsläppsbränslen i den europeiska flottans energimix, enligt en kravnivå som stiger vart femte år. Finlands regering har beslutat att tillämpa ett liknande ö-undantag för FuelEU som för ETS fram till den 31 december 2029. Påverkan på likviditeten till följd av FuelEU Maritime förväntas vara minimal under den första femårsperioden.

Viking Line Abp:s placering i Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö har under rapportperioden genererat ett resultat om -0,2 Meur. Viking Line erhåller siffrorna från Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö med ett kvartals förskjutning. Den under perioden erhållna dividenden från Rederiaktiebolaget Eckerö om 1,0 Meur resulterar i enlighet med IAS 28.10 för koncernen endast i ett positivt kassaflöde. Viking Lines andel av Gotland Alandia Cruises AB:s resultat har för perioden 1 januari – 30 juni 2025 genererat i ett resultat om -3,2 Meur. 13.

Anders Hamnes, VD och grundare av Oneflow, kommenterar: “Vid utgången av det andra kvartalet uppgick vår Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) till 171,2 MSEK, en ökning med 19 procent jämfört med samma period föregående år. Hittills i år har vår ARR påverkats negativt med 2,6 MSEK till följd av valutakursfluktuationer. Net New ARR för kvartalet uppgick till 6,6 MSEK, jämfört med 9,9 MSEK under det andra kvartalet föregående år. Dessutom har vi tecknat avtal om 8,1 MSEK som kommer att intäktsföras efter kvartalet. De främsta faktorerna bakom vår långsammare tillväxttrend är oförändrade: begränsad merförsäljning till befintliga kunder och något högre churn. Vår Gross och Net Retention Rate uppgick vid kvartalets slut till 87,1 procent (90,8) respektive 96,7 procent (107,8). Samtidigt som vi aktivt stärker vår produktstrategi, marknadsposition och go-to-market-exekvering, bedömer vi att det bredare marknadsklimatet fortsatt är den mest betydande begränsande faktorn – en utmaning som många mjukvarubolag står inför idag. Med det sagt är vi fortsatt trygga i styrkan i vår plattform och kvaliteten på vårt team. Oneflow erbjuder fortfarande en av de mest avancerade och heltäckande lösningarna för avtalshantering på marknaden, och vi är väl positionerade för att anpassa oss och utvecklas. Vårt fokus ligger på långsiktig och hållbar utveckling – vi jagar inte kortsiktiga vinster, utan bygger med målmedvetenhet och uthållighet. Under det andra kvartalet omstrukturerade vi delar av organisationen som en del av vårt pågående arbete med att bygga en hög­effektiv verksamhet. Denna omorganisation resulterade i en minskning av antalet anställda (med vissa fortfarande i övergång) och en engångskostnad om 3,6 MSEK, som redovisades under kvartalet. Genom dessa förändringar stärker vi vår effektivitet och går in i det tredje kvartalet med en tydlig riktning och stabil grund. Ansvarsområden har fördelats om internt, och vi förväntar oss inte att dessa förändringar kommer att påverka vår försäljning eller totala prestation negativt. Vår EBIT-marginal förbättrades till -49,9 procent, jämfört med -75,6 procent under det andra kvartalet föregående år. EBIT-förlusten för kvartalet uppgick till -20,7 MSEK, eller -17,1 MSEK justerat för engångsposter, vilket motsvarar en EBIT-marginal på -41,2 procent. Vi är fortsatt trygga i vår prognos och förväntar oss en betydande förbättring av EBIT under andra halvåret 2025. Som meddelades den 23 juni och godkändes vid den extra bolagsstämman den 9 juli, expanderar Oneflow till Nordamerika genom ett strategiskt initiativ med låg risk. I partnerskap med styrelseledamöterna Lars Appelstål och Bengt Nilsson, som gemensamt kommer att investera cirka 15 MSEK i satsningen, bildar vi ett nytt återförsäljarbolag, Oneflow North America. Oneflow AB kommer initialt att äga 20 procent, med en option att förvärva återstående 80 procent på förmånliga villkor (se sidorna 12–13 för fullständig information). Detta steg markerar en viktig milstolpe i vår globala tillväxtresa och erbjuder betydande potential med minimal finansiell exponering. Vår långsiktiga ambition är fortsatt att överstiga 30 procent ARR-tillväxt samtidigt som vi når lönsamhet inom ramen för befintlig finansiering. Som vi beskrev i vår delårsrapport för första kvartalet inser vi dock att lönsamhet måste prioriteras i det nuvarande klimatet. Det innebär att vi tillfälligt kommer att nedprioritera aggressiva tillväxtmål tills vi har etablerat en hållbar och lönsam grund, vilket förblir vårt främsta fokus och vårt åtagande .

Om Oneflow Oneflow utvecklar en plattform som automatiserar hela avtalsprocessen med hjälp av AI. Avtal ligger i hjärtat av alla verksamheter, men trots att världen genomgår en digital omvandling fastnar avtalen ofta i en röra av PDF-filer, äldre system och inkorgar, bara för att få dem signerade. Oneflow tror att det finns ett bättre sätt att hantera avtal. Ett sätt som är intelligent, användarvänligt, datadrivet och samlar alla steg i processen på en plats, vilket möjliggör tydlighet och samarbete mellan alla parter. Och de, i sin tur, kan fokusera på det de gör bäst. Med Oneflow blir avtalen smartare, vilket ger våra användare en magisk upplevelse. Testa gratis på oneflow.com .

Highlights DKK 8.5bn revenue – a 2% decrease DKK 706m EBITDA – a 4% decrease DKK 542m cash flow from operations – a 61% improvement DKK 10.18 earnings per share – a 3% decrease 12.5% ROIC excluding goodwill – a 1.3 pp decrease Full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance narrowed within previous range. Statement by Jens Bjerg Sørensen, President of Schouw & Co. – Schouw & Co. experienced a challenging yet stable second quarter of 2025, with consolidated revenue and EBITDA slightly down on the second quarter of 2024. The diversified portfolio provided stability amid global economic changes, particularly in Chinese export markets. Despite the global challenges, we generated a solid operational cash flow of DKK 542 million. Especially BioMar, GPV and HydraSpecma showed continued solid resilience, while Borg Automotive faced difficult market conditions. We maintain a positive outlook, narrowing our full-year 2025 guidance within the previously announced range. We have previously announced that we are investigating whether a potential separate listing of BioMar would create value for the shareholders of Schouw & Co. The preparatory work continued as expected during the past quarter, and a banking syndicate has been established. If found to be value-creating, the listing of BioMar on the Copenhagen stock exchange can take place in the first half of 2026 .

The adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.5 per cent (12.0). This means that our profitable and sustainable growth is continuing, as our revenue for the second quarter showed an increase from the preceding quarter and from the corresponding period last year. The operating environment remains unstable. The erratic trade and customs policy of the United States is reflected in uncertainty, especially in consumer-driven demand, which remains weak in spite of lower interest rates. Koskisen has little trade with the US market, so the direct impacts of customs and trade policy are minor. The recovery of the construction sector has also yet to materialise. Although decisions that stimulate demand have been made in Europe, their impact remains small. The profitability of the Sawn Timber Industry segment improved substantially during the second quarter year-on-year, with EBITDA amounting to EUR 4.2 (1.6) million. Shift-specific production in Järvelä developed in line with expectations, and other operational indicators also developed in the right direction. Considering the operating environment and the general situation in the industry, the segment's profit performance remained strong: revenue grew substantially and EBITDA was at a moderate level of approximately 9 per cent in spite of summer-related demand being more subdued than expected. The outlook for the autumn remains broadly uncertain in several markets. The acquisition of the business operations of Iisveden Metsä was completed at the beginning of June. The harmonisation of processes and systems is progressing according to plan: the financial systems have already been integrated, and the integration of production control and wood procurement systems is expected to be completed during the second half of the year. The business acquisition enables us to deliver even greater value to our customers, for example through market-specific product concepts and by centralizing them to the most suitable production facility. The expanded wood procurement area resulting from the acquisition ensures the availability of raw materials and enables organic growth also in the Panel Industry. The acquisition did not yet have a significant impact on revenue or profitability for the quarter under review. We continue to increase the production volume of the new sawmill towards the target of 450,000 m 3 , and we started construction work on the district heating connection pipe between the production plants in Järvelä. The pipe will optimise the operating rate of the power plant situated adjacent to the plywood and chipboard plants, which is currently underutilised. This will enable the continuous production of electricity in the existing power plant and improve the efficiency of heat production. The construction of the connection pipe will allow us to completely avoid a new additional heat investment related to sawmill production, which would otherwise be required at this time to increase drying capacity, which is a bottleneck in production. Wood procurement was carried out according to plan, and wood reserves remained at a good level. The price of wood raw material in the reserve is still at a high level but, towards the end of the quarter under review, it appeared that the peak in price had passed and the purchase price of raw material began to decrease slightly. In the energy wood market, the mild winter was reflected in demand and thus in the revenue and profit performance of the Sawn Timber Industry segment: demand among operators using energy wood was lower than expected, and inventories were higher than in previous years. This will be reflected in slightly lower prices during the coming contract period. The profitability of the Panel Industry segment decreased year-on-year, with EBITDA amounting to EUR 6.7 (8.1) million. Profitability was negatively affected by the increase in wood raw material costs and general production costs. However, in terms of EBITDA, the profitability of the Panel Industry segment was still at a fair level at nearly 16 per cent. The demand for plywood was moderate and picked up towards the end of the quarter, while prices remained stable. The demand for chipboard still reflects the low level of new construction and renovation activity. Chipboard prices have remained somewhat stable, but the profitability of the product category is negatively affected by the high price of wood raw material in particular. The first stage of the investment programme in the Panel Industry segment progressed according to plan, and the first equipment installations were carried out during the summer shutdown in July. The remaining installations will be carried out in stages in September–December, and the equipment will be in production use by the end of the year. The key objective of the investment programme is to improve productivity, quality and yield. The investments made in the first stage of the programme are focused on the automation and modernisation of drying, coating and puttying, among other things. We are continuing to systematically reduce the climate and environmental impacts of our products. In May, we launched Zero ThinPly, a new thin plywood product that is made entirely from bio-based materials. We have also piloted the use of decommissioned wood packaging material from retail and wholesale supply chains — such as pallets — as a raw material for chipboard. Thanks to the recycled wood cleaning process developed during the pilot, wood that was previously directed to incineration can be used as raw material for chipboard, and the end product is as clean and high in quality as products made from virgin wood raw material.

EBITDA was DKK 9.7m, a 23% YoY decrease. EBT was DKK 4.0m, a 50% YoY decrease. Unique paying users (UPU) were 222,158, a 17% YoY increase. Total transactions were 638,570, a 20% YoY increase. Total installs were 16.9m, a 114% YoY increase. Q2 Revenue was DKK 23.6m, a 7.5% YoY decrease. EBITDA was DKK 3.5m, a 55% YoY decrease. EBT was DKK 0.03m, a 99% YoY decrease. Unique paying users (UPU) were 137,457, a 18% YoY increase. Total transactions were 347,268, a 17% YoY increase. Total installs were 7.8m, a 60% YoY increase. Building Momentum The second quarter of 2025 was marked by strong operational focus, delivering results in line with expectations while laying the groundwork for accelerated growth in the second half of the year. Activities intensified from mid-May, with the scale-up of Truck Manager , followed by the late-June release of Farm Manager . While these milestones had only a limited direct impact on Q2 Financials, they have already had a clear effect on top-funnel KPIs creating a clear shift in momentum. July 2025 thus marked a historic milestone with revenue of DKK 10.7 million - the highest in company history. The early scaling of both titles is already exceeding expectations, building powerful momentum and positioning Trophy Games for a record-breaking second half of the year. Temporary Pressures for Long-Term Gains In Q2, we invested DKK 2 million more in marketing compared to last year, primarily to launch campaigns for Truck Manager and Farm Manager. As these campaigns began late in the quarter, the cost impact was immediate, while the revenue benefit will materialise in Q3 and beyond. It’s worth noting that Q2 2024 benefited from an exceptional - but temporary - boost in iOS marketing payback, with campaigns performing three times above normal levels . This one-off advantage makes year-on-year comparisons less straightforward. In addition, a weakened USD - down nearly 15% since January - impacted both our revenue and operating profit as more than half of our sales are directly or indirectly influenced by movements in the USD. We also faced a one-time financial expense of DKK 990 thousand in tax interest payments, due to the Danish Tax Authority’s retrospective withdrawal of the Tax Credit Scheme (Skattekreditordningen) for software development. This ruling impacted thousands of Danish IT companies. For Trophy Games, the impact is a short-term liquidity drain, but we expect to offset this through tax loss carryforward already in the 2025 income year. The combination of these factors, along with our ability to scale marketing faster than initially projected, led to a temporary pause of the share buyback program in Q2. With marketing campaigns typically breaking even within six months, even modest monthly increases in spend can significantly influence liquidity in the short term. Stronger Outlook Driven by Early Success Our focus on Truck Manager and Farm Manager is already reshaping our KPIs. From installs to active engagement and paying user numbers, these two titles have delivered a notable uplift. Updated figures including July clearly show a stronger Q3 outlook compared to Q2. This acceleration in topline growth is why we chose to revise our guidance early and share preliminary figures that include July and early August. The Ranchers Our French studio partner Redpilz is working intensively to complete the first public demo of The Ranchers . Once ready, the sequence will be: demo release, participation in Steam’s Next Fest , followed by an Early Access launch . For a premium PC title, day-one quality is critical - there is no margin for a “soft” launch. That’s why polishing and player testing are non-negotiable. The demo is arriving later than planned, introducing uncertainty around the release date. To safeguard quality, we have removed The Ranchers from our current guidance. The release is approaching, but we will not compromise on delivering a first-class player experience. Positioned for a Record-Breaking H2 2025 With two high-potential titles scaling rapidly , KPIs moving sharply upward, and July already delivering a company-record revenue, Trophy Games enters the second half of 2025 with an exciting outlook. While short-term liquidity has been impacted by targeted investments in development, marketing and one-off expenses, these actions are designed to secure sustainable, scalable growth . Our strategy remains focused: invest decisively in our most promising titles, ensure quality in all releases, and build long-term shareholder value. As these initiatives bear fruit, we see compelling upside ahead - both for our games and for our investors. Thank you for your continued support.

EBITDA was down by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million, and profit before tax (EBT) was down by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million. As announced on 10 July 2025, our full-year revenue guidance for 2025 has been lowered to a range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%), while our earnings margin guidance is maintained at an EBITDA margin of 19-21% and an EBT margin of 11-13%. We therefore expect to achieve revenue and earnings at the same level as the record year of 2024. The Board of Directors of SP Group A/S today considered and approved the interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2025, which includes the following highlights (all changes are calculated in relation to the first half of 2024): Revenue fell by 1.2% to DKK 1,466.9 million in H1. Revenue for Q2 was down by 10.7% year on year. Earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million in H1 for an EBITDA margin of 19.8%. EBITDA for Q2 was down by 18.8% to DKK 124.8 million for an EBITDA margin of 18.3%. Profit before tax (EBT) fell by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million in H1 for an EBT margin of 11.2%. EBT for Q2 was down by 30.6% to DKK 63.6 million for an EBT margin of 9.4%. H1 sales of own products declined by 11.5% to DKK 388.4 million. Own products accounted for 26.5% of revenue for the period. Sales of other products grew in H1, while Healthcare, Foodtech and Cleantech suffered a setback. Cash flows from operating activities were a net inflow of DKK 228.7 million in H1 against DKK 256.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 756.9 million at 30 June 2025, compared to DKK 923.8 million at 30 June 2024. At 31 December 2024, NIBD amounted to DKK 821.1 million. NIBD was 1.3x LTM EBITDA. NIBD fell by DKK 64.2 million in H1 2025. SP Meditec is nearing completion of its production ramp-up in Peachtree City, near Atlanta, USA. Due to a high number of customer projects, we are currently exploring options to expand production capacity further. In Poland, we have initiated the conversion of one of our factory buildings for the manufacturing of components for medical devices. Ergomat has successfully launched new sales activities in Asia, including in key markets such as India and Japan. We expect only marginal impact from a new US–EU trade agreement. SP Group expects revenue growth for FY 2025 in the range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%) for an EBITDA margin of 19-21%. Lars Bering, CEO: “ Following a record-breaking first quarter in terms of revenue and earnings, SP Group generated lower-than-expected sales and earnings in the second quarter of 2025 due to the postponement of several orders and projects during the period. The Q2 performance was impacted by ongoing geopolitical unrest, leading to increased uncertainty in global markets with several of our customers postponing the launch of new projects. However, we are pleased to see increased activity in the defence industry, which has led to several exciting projects for SP. Our subsupplier production grew in the course of H1 2025, as did the inflow of medical device industry projects, resulting in high activity levels at our US factory and the factories in Europe. ” For further information: CEO Lars Bering Phone: +45 70 23 23 79 Invitation: Presentation of interim report for the first half of 2025 In continuation of the release of this interim report, SP Group will host a webcast on 20 August 2025 at 1:00 p.m. (in Danish) and at 3:00 p.m. (in English).

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year. Free cash flow in Q2 was DKK 32 million, compared to DKK 26 million in Q2 2024. This improvement was driven by higher earnings and an improvement in the net working capital. CAPEX amounted to DKK 18.3 million (Q2 2024: DKK 12.0 million), mainly related to the ERP project and the new lacquering facility. The lacquering facility was completed during the quarter and is expected to ramp up fully during the present quarter. After acquiring 45% of the online retailer Celebert ApS in 2021, we have now agreed to acquire the remaining 55% following the decision of the majority shareholder to exercise its put option. During the four years of co-ownership, Celebert has grown rapidly, and we are confident that, once the relevant regulatory approvals are in place, Celebert will continue this growth journey. Considering the results from the first six months of the year and the development in order intake during Q2, we are narrowing our guidance for 2025. TCM Group now expects full-year revenue in the range of DKK 1,250–1,300 million (previously DKK 1,250 – 1,325 million) and adjusted EBIT of DKK 90–110 million (previously DKK 90-115 million).

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year. Free cash flow in Q2 was DKK 32 million, compared to DKK 26 million in Q2 2024. This improvement was driven by higher earnings and an improvement in the net working capital. CAPEX amounted to DKK 18.3 million (Q2 2024: DKK 12.0 million), mainly related to the ERP project and the new lacquering facility. The lacquering facility was completed during the quarter and is expected to ramp up fully during the present quarter. After acquiring 45% of the online retailer Celebert ApS in 2021, we have now agreed to acquire the remaining 55% following the decision of the majority shareholder to exercise its put option. During the four years of co-ownership, Celebert has grown rapidly, and we are confident that, once the relevant regulatory approvals are in place, Celebert will continue this growth journey. Considering the results from the first six months of the year and the development in order intake during Q2, we are narrowing our guidance for 2025. TCM Group now expects full-year revenue in the range of DKK 1,250–1,300 million (previously DKK 1,250 – 1,325 million) and adjusted EBIT of DKK 90–110 million (previously DKK 90-115 million).

Q2 gross margin of 45%, level with Q2 2024 Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $82 thousand, compared with $239 thousand in Q2 2024 Liquid Cooling revenue of $9.8 million, up from $8.6 million in Q1 2025 and compared with $11 million in Q2 2024 SimSports revenue in line with expectations at $1.3 million following the U.S. import tariff announcements in April, compared with $1.7 million in Q2 2024 First-half 2025 revenue of $21.0 million, and adjusted EBITDA of negative $0.2 million compared with $24.9 million and positive $0.2 million in first-half 2024, respectively Group revenue expectation for 2025 is maintained in the range of $45 to $53 million with adjusted EBITDA at 0% to 3%. Asetek reported second-quarter revenue of $11.2 million compared with $12.7 million in the same period of 2024. First-half 2025 revenue was $21.0 million compared with $24.9 million in the first half of 2024. The change in both periods mainly reflects fewer shipments of liquid cooling products. Gross margin was level at 45% for both the second quarter and first half of 2025 and the respective periods of 2024. “Amidst continued macro uncertainties, Asetek experiences strong momentum with new and existing Liquid Cooling customers led by innovative products for a wider market, focused commercial work and a growing recognition of our quality, established supply chain and full service offering in volatile markets. This week, we are launching our Initium mass-market sim racing product portfolio at Gamescom in Germany, significantly widening our addressable market. Within both our segments, we are positioned to deliver long-term profitable growth when markets stabilize,” says André S. Eriksen, the CEO of Asetek. Adjusted EBITDA was $82 thousand in the second quarter of 2025, compared with $239 thousand in the second quarter of 2024. First-half 2025 adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.2 million, compared with positive $0.2 million in the same period of 2024. To strengthen the Company’s financial position and enable continued investments in the SimSports segment, Asetek completed an equity rights offering in January, raising net proceeds of $10.3 million through the issuance of 219.9 million new common shares. During the first half of 2025, the Company invested $0.5 million in property and equipment and $1.4 million in capitalized costs for the development of new products. At June 30, 2025, Asetek had working capital of $11.3 million, including $7.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. OPERATIONS In May, the Company announced the launch of Ingrid, a new platform-based liquid cooling solution engineered to deliver superior thermal performance, reduced acoustic footprint, and platform-level flexibility for both partners and PC builders. The Ingrid product line offers a newly engineered pump, smart thermal sensing, and a new level of B2B configurability not previously available in all-in-one coolers. In June, Asetek announced a new customer agreement with Antec, a global leader in high-performance computer components, marking the first delivery of mainstream liquid cooling products based on Asetek’s new platform. The agreement includes Antec’s new Vortex View AIO liquid cooler and deliveries are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Asetek announced the launch of its Forte Formula Pro Steering Wheel, a fully customizable high-performance sim racing wheel that offers immersive display technology, precise input control, and lightweight durability. OUTLOOK In the second half of 2025, Asetek plans launches of new products in both Liquid Cooling and SimSports – including liquid cooling products designed for the mid-market. The initial mass-market sim racing products will launch this week at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, and the first console-supported SimSports offering is expected in late 2025 or early 2026. The Group outlook is maintained at revenue of $45 to $53 million and adjusted EBITDA of 0% to 3% of revenue for 2025. The outlook reflects the expected impact on SimSports revenues from the tariffs implemented by the U.S. government on imports from other countries, most significantly related to products made in China. Asetek expects Liquid Cooling revenue growth to return in 2026 supported by the recent measures to strengthen management, new products widening the addressable market, focused commercial work yielding new customers and closer collaboration with the existing base.

Reported revenue in DKK grew 1% with negative impact from currencies and the Skin Care divestment. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy. Growth in Advanced Wound Dressings was -2%, driven primarily by a significant decline in China which was impacted by a preventative and voluntary product return of all Biatain® Adhesive foam dressings in the market. The product return is expected to have a negative revenue impact of around DKK 80 million in H2, of which around DKK 20 million impacted Q3. Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3. EBIT 1 was DKK 1,915 million, a 2% increase from last year. The EBIT margin 1,2 was 28%, against 27% last year.

Reported revenue in DKK grew 1% with negative impact from currencies and the Skin Care divestment. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy. Growth in Advanced Wound Dressings was -2%, driven primarily by a significant decline in China which was impacted by a preventative and voluntary product return of all Biatain® Adhesive foam dressings in the market. The product return is expected to have a negative revenue impact of around DKK 80 million in H2, of which around DKK 20 million impacted Q3. Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3. EBIT 1 was DKK 1,915 million, a 2% increase from last year. The EBIT margin 1,2 was 28%, against 27% last year. Changes to the Executive Leadership Team announced, to support the successful execution of the new company strategy towards 2030. 9M 2024/25 organic growth of 7% and EBIT margin 1 of 27%. Reported revenue in DKK grew 4% to DKK 20,914 million. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 9% and Interventional Urology 1%. EBIT 1 was DKK 5,718 million, a 4% increase from last year. The EBIT margin 1 was 27%, on par with last year 2 . Adjusted 3 net profit before special items was DKK 3,778 million, a DKK 15 million decrease from last year, negatively impacted by non-cash effect from net financial expenses. Adjusted 3 diluted earnings per share (EPS) before special items decreased by 1% to DKK 16.76. Adjusted 3 ROIC after tax before special items was 15%, on par with last year. FY 2024/25 guidance is unchanged with organic growth of around 7% and an EBIT margin before special items of 27-28%. Organic growth now includes the negative impact from the product return in Advanced Wound Dressings in China, partly offset by good momentum in the other business areas. Reported growth in DKK is now expected to be 3-4%, with around 2%-points negative impact from currencies and around 1.5%-points negative impact from the Skin Care divestment. The assumptions on the reported EBIT margin before special items are largely unchanged. Special items expectations are unchanged, around DKK 450 million. Expectations on capital expenditures and tax rate (ordinary and effective) are also unchanged. ""We deliver a third quarter as expected with 7% organic growth and an EBIT margin of 28%, maintaining our financial guidance for 2024/25.

It is encouraging to see our business units working together, both locally and cross-border, to strengthen our product- and solution-driven go-to-market approach. This is beginning to be reflected in our numbers. In the first half of 2025, our product-based segment, Run, grew revenue by 59.4% and accounted for 33.6% of total revenue. Revenue from our in-house IP grew by 25.8%, supported by increased demand for our sovereign, secure, and resilient datacenter solutions in our subsidiary Netic. Our public sector business delivered solid growth of 19.1% in the first six months and now represents 39.7% of revenue. We won 11 out of 13 tenders during the period, and our teams are focused on applying our high win rate to a significantly larger volume of opportunities in the coming years. In Q2, we announced two new public digital health engagements in Switzerland and Oman, as well as the Digital Identity Wallet contract in Denmark. The profitability in the first half of the year was negatively affected by one-off costs related to the rightsizing initiatives and large pre-sales efforts. As previously communicated, the benefits will be backloaded into the second half of the year. Combined with our overall visibility and expectations, we maintain the financial guidance for 2025.” Second quarter 2025 Trifork Group In Q2/2025, Trifork Group revenue amounted to EURm 55.1, a net increase of 5.1% from Q2/2024, the combined result of an organic growth of 2.9% and an inorganic growth of 2.2%. Trifork Group adjusted EBITDA amounted to EURm 5.2, corresponding to a margin of 9.4% (Q2/2024: 11.0%). No special items were recorded in Q2/2025. Trifork Group EBIT amounted to EURm 1.1, corresponding to a margin of 2.1% (Q2/2024: 3.6%). Trifork Segment In Q2/2025, adjusted EBITDA in the Trifork Segment amounted to EURm 5.7 (Q2/2024: EURm 6.3), corresponding to a margin of 10.4% (Q2 2024: 12.0%). Sub-segments Inspire revenue declined by -40.1% to EURm 1.4 and realized an adjusted EBITDA of EURm -0.4 (Q2/2024: EURm 0.0). Build revenue declined by -7.8% to EURm 34.3 and realized an adjusted EBITDA margin of 9.1% (Q2/2024: 13.0%). Run revenue increased by 51.6% to EURm 19.3. Adjusted for EUR 4.6m higher hardware and third-party licenses compared to Q2/2024, revenue growth was 18.4%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.9% (Q2/2024: 19.2%). Trifork Labs In Q2/2025, fair value adjustment of Trifork Labs investments was EURm 0.7 (Q2/2024: EURm 1.2) At 30 June 2025, the book value of active Labs investments amounted to EURm 84.4 (30 June 2024: EURm 76.7). The financial outlook for full-year 2025 provided on 28 February is maintained: Revenue is expected to be in the range of EURm 215-225, equal to 4.4-9.3% total growth Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 2.9-7.8% Adjusted EBITDA in Trifork Segment is expected in the range of EURm 32.0-37.0 EBIT in Trifork Group is expected to be in the range of EURm 14.5-19.5. The guidance does not include potential effects from potential future acquisitions or divestments.

The deadline for any potential appeals to the Supreme Court ended yesterday, 18 August. Neither party has appealed the decision and the court decision from 3 June remains valid. “Tietoevry and SpareBank1 Utvikling have agreed to revitalize their partnership with a shared commitment of strengthening the competitiveness of the SpareBank1-alliance. Together with SpareBank1 Utvikling, Tietoevry will accelerate the modernization and standardization of technological solutions, aiming to reduce operational costs and boost the alliance’s capacity for innovation”, comments Endre Rangnes, President and CEO of Tietoevry. The court ruling on the dispute will result in a positive impact on Tietoevry’s second-half 2025 financials. As disclosed in the half-year report, the Borgarting Court of Appeals ruled in June in Tietoevry’s favour on an increase of approximately EUR 35 million (NOK 410 million) in fixed fee.

CEO STATEMENT Dear Shareholders, Team Teneo.ai and Partners, The second quarter 2025 marks another strong growth in Y-O-Y numbers and some significant milestones in our focus on new customer engagements, with a doubled pipeline Q-o-Q. The M&A market has also heated up during the summer with some large investments and acquisitions that prove to us and customers that the Teneo hybrid ML, LLM is the right AI solution for Voice. Market Overview The mindshare of OpenAI has been deafening in the last few years. Sam Altman’s predictions gain more headlines than wars. This has led to all our customers experimenting with companies that provide wrappers on top of LLM´s. This is different than our approach – we use proprietary technology in Teneo to understand what customers are calling about. This technology is based on traditional Machine Learning as well as Small Language Models and in the development of the customer solution Large Language Models are used. Newly minted companies that have seen a lot of investments and gained attention such as Sierra.ai use only Large Language Models. In July we saw an acquisition that validates our approach. Cognigy, was acquired in July by NiCE (number two in Contact Center Software) at a valuation of 26 times sales including Professional Services. Total purchase price of 955 MUSD. Their technology is a platform using deterministic models just like ours. NiCE could of course have acquired any of the LLM wrapper companies at a much lower price but chose to acquire a comprehensive platform. This proves that to really have impact in the Contact Center you need to use deterministic technologies rather than only Large Language Models. Customers are slowly arriving at the same conclusion. We are currently engaged in three proofs of concepts where we see great increases in accuracy with our approach. The pure LLM players are currently increasing the sales cycle but luckily LLM´s are also more expensive to use in production so this does not increase price pressure. When considering Enterprise features such as security, accuracy, and performance Teneo remains uniquely positioned in the market, effectively managing high-volume telephony operations and automating up to 91% of incoming calls (more on this new number below), offering unmatched efficiency and reliability. Teneo.ai has a large proportion of our business with US customers. The company maintains a stable outlook, with no immediate risks aside from currency exchange rates identified from current U.S. administrative actions or proposed economic measures, including toll tariffs. Sales Cycles have increased as many customers are restrictive with investments in an uncertain environment. The positive side of the current development for Teneo is an increased focus on cost reductions which increases the interest in adding AI Agents into the workforce. Pipeline Development Sales and Marketing in the second quarter 2025 prioritized qualifying the opportunities created in the first quarter 2025 and putting focus on the closeable opportunities. We also broadened our geographical focus to include Turkey where we see interest in our solutions. Partnerships Two important additional partnerships were signed during the second quarter 2025. EBO.ai, a company focused on automation that delivers to the same National Healthcare unit that CGI and we renewed the agreement just after the second quarter 2025. Together we are building a role model hospital contact center built on Teneo in the Middle East that we also will be showcasing to UK and US prospects. By combining EBO´s healthcare trained AI models with Teneo we will be able to increase patient access and satisfaction while freeing up valuable care resources. We also welcome FGS as a partner. FGS is part of the Vodafone group and has a very strong presence in Turkish Enterprises. Their local knowledge combined with a strong Turkish enterprise interest in using AI to automate Customer Care make this ideal for Teneo collaboration and we already have several joint opportunities we are addressing. Analysts In the Contact Center space there is an analyst that is trusted by more enterprises than any other. That is DMG Consulting. In the DMG Consulting's 2025 enterprise report where we participated for the first time, Teneo.ai earned perfect customer satisfaction scores across seven key areas, including implementation, pricing, and overall vendor satisfaction. This achievement is particularly significant because it's based on feedback from actual enterprise customers, validating Teneo's voice-first agentic AI platform for contact center automation. The perfect scores underscore the Teneo´s ability to deliver value through high accuracy rates and substantial operational cost savings. For Teneo, this recognition solidifies our position as a trusted and leading partner in a competitive market, where customer satisfaction is a critical differentiator. Customer Feedback Our Teneo is the only tool that has the accuracy and performance to actually replace people answering the phone. In the second quarter 2025, we got this confirmed by one of our very large customers. This customer has 10 million inbound calls per month. In order to serve these customers correctly the most important component is understanding why they are calling. This is called Natural Language Understanding. This is the step that entails both the accuracy in transcribing speech to text and then parsing understanding from this text. In this customer the understanding was 99% - which is much better than any other solution. But even more importantly 91% of all calls were manged by Teneo instead of a human leading to higher customer satisfaction. That is 9.1 million automated calls per month. Astonishing ROI! Strategic Sales Events During second quarter 2025, we have focused on developing the opportunities that we created in the first quarter 2025. We have moved six to qualified, three into proposal sent and we have three in the stage Pilot/POC. This means that we are progressing our opportunities and focusing the work on closing. The pipeline almost doubled to 2 MEUR in weighted numbers primarily due to the progression of our opportunities. Our new sales pipeline is measured as a 12-month subscription value, excluding future API calls—though API calls make up most of our revenue. The pipeline is weighted based on the sales stage of each opportunity and does not include additional revenue from existing customers. For example, consider a sales opportunity for a new customer similar to one of our large existing clients. If this opportunity is in the *qualified* sales stage, it would be valued at: 9,900 times 12 months times 20% (weight for qualified stage) = approximately 24,000 EUR. While the long-term potential revenue from such a customer could be 3.5 MEUR per year, our pipeline reflects only 24,000 EUR at this stage. Since our first quarter 2025 report, our weighted pipeline has again almost doubled to 2 045 000 EUR from 1 050 000 EUR in our first quarter 2025 report. Our pipeline progression this quarter is mostly driven by our opportunities moving up in sales stages thereby increasing the probability of closing. We have fewer opportunities in total as we have qualified out some of the created opportunities in the first quarter 2025. The remaining pipeline includes major enterprises across various sectors, driven by factors such as the discontinuation of Nuance (the foundation for traditional keypad navigation systems) and our partnership with Genesys and the associated eco system. Our first opportunity where AWS has engaged together with our partner Cloudhesive is also a promising development opening up more avenues for pipeline development. Preparation for Teneo 8 rollout During the third quarter 2025 we will be rolling out the biggest update to our Teneo ever. The details will be released at a later stage during the quarter. In preparation for this we have been pushing legacy, chat only customers to accept upgrading to the new codebase. We delivered a record gross margin of 88% in the second quarter 2025, but in order to further bring up our gross margin we want all customers to use one and the same codebase. Customers that use chat only in Teneo do not see the value in the solutions as does a voice customer and therefore those that are not able to move to voice will likely not be moving to the new codebase. In our forward looking ARR metric we have taken this into account. Those customers are costly for us to serve and the functionality we are pushing in the new release is very important for our enterprise voice prospects and customers. Last quarters change in how we operate our SaaS has brought the cost savings and associated higher Gross Margin as projected. Autumn focus Looking ahead we have the partnerships and pipeline to deliver on our goal to hit 20 MUSD ARR within the first quarter 2026. Selling to large enterprises involves many stakeholders and many hoops to go through. Once we are in the process, we see that our message resonates and when we have the chance to prove our technology we never fail. We have enough qualified opportunity to reach our goal – now its closing focus. I want to express my sincere gratitude to our dedicated team, our valued partners, and exceptional customers for their continued collaboration. And of course, to our shareholders who continue to support us on this journey! Thank you all for your continued support and confidence.

Last year’s corresponding period in parentheses. The comparative figures for the income statement and personnel are adjusted and do not include information on the divested Project Personnel and Norwegian Consulting businesses. Suvic subgroup is fully consolidated in the Group’s financial statements. The non-controlling interest (49%) is presented as a separate line item in the income statements and balance sheet. April–June 2025 Net sales decreased 45.8% to EUR 12.3 (22.6) million Renewable Energy: net sales EUR 11.7 (22.1) million – decrease of 46.9% Consulting: net sales EUR 0.5 million (0.5) – increase of 2.4% EBITDA EUR 10.4 negative (1.2) million Operating profit EUR 10.6 negative (1.0) million Profit before tax EUR 10.9 negative (0.8) million Earnings for the shareholders of the parent company total EUR 5.0 negative (1.0) million Continued operations EUR 5.8 negative (0.3) million Discontinued operations EUR 0.8 (0.8) million Earnings per share were EUR 0.047 negative (0.010) Continued operations EUR 0.056 negative (0.003) Discontinued operations EUR 0.008 (0.007) Net cashflow from operating activities was EUR 4.4 (1.6) million January–June 2025 Net sales decreased by 28.3% to EUR 26.3 (36.6) million. Renewable Energy: net sales EUR 25.3 (35.6) million – a decrease of 28.8%. Consulting: net sales EUR 0.9 (1.0) million – a decrease of 7.8%. EBITDA was EUR 13.3 million negative (EUR 4.6 million negative) Operating result was EUR 13.8 million negative (EUR 4.8 million negative) Profit before tax was EUR 14.4 million negative (EUR 5.2 million negative) Earnings for the shareholders of the parent company were EUR 0.1 million negative (EUR 1.4 million negative) Continued operations EUR 7.9 million negative (3.1 million negative) Discontinued operations EUR 7.8 (1.7) million Earnings per share were EUR 0.001 negative (0.013 negative) Continued operations EUR 0.075 negative (0.029 negative) Discontinued operations EUR 0.074 (0.016) Net cash flow from operating activities was EUR -5.8 (0.3 negative) million. Dovre Group’s profitability for the period was clearly negative. This was mainly due to increased losses booked on the reporting period (EUR 5.0 million) from Renewable Energy projects that were started in Sweden during 2024, as well as lowered gross margin estimates from a wind farm project launched in Sweden during the reporting period and a solar farm project launched in Finland in 2024. Also, some projects have progressed slower than anticipated, which in turn slows their revenue recognition. The Swedish wind farm projects are technically successful and will reach completion during the coming months. In the Q1 trading statement we estimated the profit from discontinued operations, i.e. the sale of businesses, at EUR 7.0 million. Our updated analysis indicates this profit to be somewhat higher, EUR 7.8 million, which is reflected in this H1 report. Some hand-over practicalities are still in progress, and thus this number may be further updated later. Outlook for 2025 (issued on August 14, 2025) Dovre Group’s net sales in 2025 are expected to decline in comparison to year 2024. The Group's Operating Profit (EBIT) is expected to improve, while still remaining negative. ACTING CEO SANNA OUTA-OLLILA: Prolonged challenges in the two wind farm projects started in 2024 by Suvic’s Swedish subsidiary have significantly affected performance during the first half of 2025. The extent of the issues has emerged gradually over time and has resulted into two negative profit warnings during the year, the latter of which was issued July 8, 2025. Corrective actions have been taken at an increasing pace, and planned management changes have been completed. Markku Taskinen was appointed as Suvic’s new CEO during the second quarter and he stepped in on Agust 4, 2025. Both Dovre Group and Suvic also have a new CFO, Olli-Pekka Vanhanen, since July 1, 2025. The Extraordinary General Meeting held on June 12 elected two new Board members, Ville Vuori and Tomi Merenheimo. Vuori has played a key role in several turnaround companies, and Merenheimo is an experienced corporate lawyer. The Board nominated Vuori as Chairman, while Ilari Koskelo continues in the role of Deputy Chair. The sale of Project Personnel business and the Norwegian Consulting business to NYAB AB was completed in the beginnig of 2025. After the transaction, Dovre is almost entirely a renewable energy group, with Suvic Oy at its core. The board of directors and management of Dovre have started a program to develop the competitiveness, operative efficiency and management processes of Suvic Oy. We remain confident that the company will succeed once the challenges have been overcome. The market continues to regard Suvic as a technically reliable partner that consistently delivers high-quality results. The sector in which the company operates continues to grow and evolve with e.g. data centers, hydrogen production and battery-based energy storage. Although renewable energy remains a cyclical industry, it should be viewed as a long-term megatrend. In Finland, Suvic’s most significant active projects include a 100 MWp solar park in Lapua (started in 2024) and three projects started in 2025; a 100 MWp solar park in Luvia, a wind farm of 54 turbines in Isojoki/Karijoki, and a 50 MW / 100 MWh battery-based energy storage (BESS) in Uusikaupunki Renewable energy project developer Renetec has grown its operation and portfolio into BESS development. Renetec has also updated some of its existing solar projects int so called hybrids, where the co-existence of a photovoltaic production and battery storage system can reach considerable financial benefits. In Consulting, the business of both Proha and eSite have continued as planned, however with a small decline in sales compared to the first half of last year. We recognize that uncertainties persist in the global market and will unavoidably also impact investments. Nevertheless, the demand for fossil-free and reasonably priced energy continues to grow and project development is active. As an established and trusted player in the market, Dovre is well-positioned for the implementation of new Renewable Energy projects. The company is committed to its mission to increase the production of green energy and actively contribute to an environmentally and socially sustainable future.

Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities Published: 2025-08-20 07:34:08 CEST FLSmidth & Co. A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024.

Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.

EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%).

Halldór Benjamín Þorbergsson, CEO of Heimar ""Operations are performing well and, following two major transactions in the first half of the year, the Company’s earnings guidance has been revised. Rental income is now estimated at ISK 15,200–15,500 million and EBITDA at ISK 10,800–11,100 million for the year 2025. We are experiencing strong demand for commercial real estate. Rental income increased by 4.9% compared to the same period last year. Changes to the property portfolio have had a positive impact on year-on-year rental growth, while like-for-like rental growth amounts to 0.3%. Two major transactions were completed in the second quarter of 2025, adding two outstanding properties, Gróska and the Exeter Hotel, to the Company’s portfolio. These properties are highly consistent with the Company’s strategy as they are both located within designated core areas, with tenants including both listed companies and public entities. The additional annual rental income from these assets is estimated at ISK 1,600 million as of 2026. The occupancy rate is 97%, in line with previous levels. Approximately 43% of the Company’s rental income derives from public entities and listed companies. Tenant defaults remain low and numerous leasing projects are in the pipeline.” Operations and Performance Operating revenues amounted to ISK 7,578 million in the first six months of the year, of which rental income amounted to ISK 7,169 million. Rental income increased by 4.9% compared to the same period in 2024, corresponding to a real increase of just under 0.5%. Several changes to the property portfolio between years have had an impact on rental income. EBITDA amounted to ISK 5,088 million, representing an increase of 4.5% compared to the same period in 2024. At the publication of the 2024 annual results, the Company presented its operating plan for 2025. Earnings guidance for 2025 has now been revised following transactions completed during the year. Rental income is now estimated at ISK 15,200–15,500 million and EBITDA at ISK 10,800–11,100 million. As a result of the investments made during the year, The Company’s Management expects rental income from the current property portfolio for the next twelve months to be in the range of ISK 16.4–16.7 billion Assets and Financial Position The fair value of the Company’s investment properties, excluding lease assets, is estimated at ISK 212,955 million. The portfolio now consists of 97 properties with a total area of approximately 389 thousand square metres. The occupancy rate is around 97%, based on revenues that would be generated under full occupancy. The total fair value adjustment for the first six months of the year amounted to ISK 1,414 million. Activity and Outlook In June, the Company completed two major transactions. Firstly, it acquired all the share capital in Gróska ehf. and Gróðurhúsið ehf. Gróska ehf. owns the property Gróska, comprising approximately 18,600 sqm together with a 6,200 sqm underground car park, or a total of around 24,800 sqm. Secondly, the Company acquired Tryggvagata ehf., which owns the properties at Tryggvagata 14 and 10. The total floor area of these properties is approximately 5,500 sqm, consisting of a 106-room, four-star hotel in downtown Reykjavík (Exeter Hotel) and an adjoining office building. The additional annual rental income from these two transactions is estimated at ISK 1,600 million as of 2026. In total, 36 lease agreements covering approximately 17,290 sqm were concluded in the second quarter, equal to the same period last year, which was the largest quarter in the Company’s history. Among the largest lease agreements during the period were: an agreement with Öldungur for 10,384 sqm in the property at Sóltún 2; an agreement with Samherji for 1,255 sqm for its new headquarters at Hagasmári 1; an agreement with EFLA for 1,009 sqm in the property at Glerárgata 32; and an agreement with Arctica Finance for 825 sqm at Katrínartún 2. All restaurant units in the new food hall, set to open in Smáralind in the coming months, have been leased — thirteen in total. There was strong demand for participation in the project. Recently, Starbucks opened a new café at Hafnartorg Gallery, Bryggjugata 2. This is Starbucks’ second location in Iceland and also its largest. The opening of Starbucks is in line with Heimar’s strategy to create vibrant core areas where people can live, work, and enjoy leisure Sustainability The number of the Company’s environmentally certified properties increased during the period, with six properties now certified, representing approximately 41% of the Company’s portfolio. Gróska was recently added to the portfolio of certified assets, and Dvergshöfði 2 is expected to follow in the autumn. Information on the financial metrics of the Company’s certified properties, as well as their carbon footprint, electricity consumption and water usage, can be found in the Green Financing Impact Report available on Heimar’s website.

Updated Outlook The Company updates its outlook for the 2025 financial year. Operating revenues are expected to be in the range of ISK 5,500–5,670 million, based on an assumed average inflation rate of 4.1% in the second half of the year. Operating profit is projected to be in the range of ISK 4,270–4,430 million. The forecast assumes that the announced transactions relating to income-generating properties will be completed in the third quarter of 2025. CEO’s Statement – Jón Þór Gunnarsson “ Solid operations and continued growth characterize the first half of the year. We are now seeing the benefits of prior years’ investments, resulting in 24% revenue growth and a stronger position for the Company. At the same time, we maintained a 78% operating profit margin (NOI ratio), which remains very strong. During the period, Kaldalón invested ISK 3.5 billion, with most of the investments made late in the half-year. Revenues from these will therefore be recognized in the second half of the year. These investments include Suðurhraun 4–6 in Garðabær and Grjótháls 2 in Reykjavík. A new service station was also delivered at Lambhagavegur. Kaldalón has, in a short time, developed a dense network of car-wash facilities for a client, with strong demand underscoring the quality and potential of arterial-road sites owned by the Company. Building permits have also been approved for 3,400 m² of industrial premises at Fossaleyni 19–23 in Reykjavík, to house food production. Delivery is scheduled for the second half of next year. The Company has signed purchase agreements, subject to customary conditions, for Krókháls 16, Skúlagata 15, and Klettháls 1A in Reykjavík. These acquisitions are expected to increase annual revenues by ISK 203 million once completed. Total assets at mid-year amounted to just under ISK 81 billion. Interest-bearing debt was just over ISK 45 billion, with the loan-to-value ratio broadly unchanged at 57.6%. During the period, the Company issued bonds and commercial papers in the market totaling ISK 6.7 billion. Listed debt now represents 31% of interest-bearing liabilities, in line with the strategy of increasing indexed debt and market-based financing. The Company’s market funding terms indicate considerable opportunities for refinancing. Demand for rental space remains stable, and the economy shows resilience to a high interest rate environment. There are no indications of a change in this trend, although the long-term effects remain to be seen. Risk-free rates increased during the period, with a negative impact on property valuations. Kaldalón continues to benefit from strong cash flows, with a weighted average lease maturity of nearly 10 years. The Company is well positioned to serve its clients’ needs and capitalize on the many opportunities we see in the real estate market. ” Purchase Agreements for New Properties Purchase agreements, subject to conditions, have been signed for Krókháls 16, Skúlagata 15, and Klettháls 1A. The total purchase price is ISK 2,335 million, payable in cash and/or by assumption of debt. The acquisitions are expected to increase Kaldalón’s annual operating profit by ISK 171 million. Completion is anticipated in Q3 2025. Interim Financial Statements 2025 The condensed interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. The report of the Board of Directors and CEO is included therein. Investor Presentation In connection with the publication of the results, an investor meeting will be held on Friday, 22 August, at 08:30 at Grand Hotel, Sigtún 28, Reykjavík. Doors open at 08:15.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

We see standard software for government evolving into a large industry, challenging the dominance of traditional suppliers. With more than 15 years of experience, a strong product position, and solid customer references, we look confidently toward the next decade. We aim to take a leadership position within the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for government industry, and we have refined our strategy accordingly. Our dual go-to-market approach balances depth with focus: we continue to build our core business around large account customers (“super accounts”), while in parallel pursuing global leadership in selected niches where F2 becomes a category-defining standard. With F2, we are shaping the future of COTS for government. Our product roadmap is driven by a unique technology position: a complete and fully integrated platform, standard software purpose-built for government, while offering easy configuration to meet customer requirements without any modification to the core software. We maintain our full year guidance Revenue for the first half of 2025 amounts to DKK 132 million, this is down 5% from DKK 139 million in the same period of 2024. Earnings before tax (EBT) total DKK 31 million, corresponding to an EBT margin of 24%. Software revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 100 million, a decrease of 10% compared to DKK 111 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower international license sales. Revenue from one-time software licenses declined by 58%, making up 14% of total revenue. Services revenue increased by 15% to DKK 32 million, representing 24% of total revenue. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) grew by 24% and represent 61% of total revenue, up from approximately 47% last year. While revenue for the first half of the year was lower due to a decline in one-time software license sales, we are encouraged by the solid performance of recurring revenue streams. The first half demonstrates a strong underlying business, with subscriptions growing 24% and services revenue increasing 15%. In addition, the solid EBT margin of 24% generated a strong positive operating cash flow of DKK 40 million. The one-time software license decline, reflects timing-related factors and market-specific delays. Given the short delivery cycles for one-time licenses, revenue is directly impacted by fluctuations in procurement schedules. In the second quarter, some Danish government organizations postponed procurements due to internal planning processes and resort changes, affecting the timing of recognized revenue. Similar to Denmark, delays in international projects have impacted results, representing a key driver of lower one-time license revenue. We maintain our full-year guidance, growing revenue 10-15% with an EBT margin of 18-23%. For the second half, we forecast continued growth in recurring licenses, and expect one-time licenses to reach a level that secures the same total volume of one-time licenses in 2025 as in 2024. In Denmark, we expect postponed procurements to be completed. Internationally, we anticipate projects across the USA, Germany, the UAE, and Africa to drive growth in one-time license revenue. Focused on long-term growth through strategic investments During the spring, cBrain (NASDAQ: CBRAIN) has taken internal steps to strengthen its organization with the aim of taking a leadership position in the fast-emerging global market for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for governments. This includes developing go-to-market strategies and establishing dedicated teams to build and lead global niches such as paperless ministry and environmental permitting. During the first half year, cBrain has been able to report progress in both verticals, with the Kenyan ministry of ICT running a pilot project and supporting the new U.S. government standard for environmental permitting. We believe the global COTS for government opportunity is significant. We have therefore also adopted a long-term perspective, even if this may affect short-term performance. cBrain has the financial strength to execute on this strategy. These changes have influenced the first half results, as we are reallocating project resources. In the beginning of the year, we allocated extra costs of 30 million DKK to support the organizational development and market investments. Until now we have allocated a smaller part of these investments, and we continue to evaluate opportunities. Thriving toward global leadership in the Paperless Ministry market The setup and configuration of cBrain F2 ® for ministries, used by Danish ministries as their digital platform, is referred to as the Paperless Ministry solution. A key pillar of the expanded growth strategy is to replicate the Danish success, and with Denmark ranked number one in the United Nations E-Government Survey for the past eight years, cBrain holds a strong reference position when exporting the Paperless Ministry solution. By establishing beachheads in new international markets, based on a vertical go-to-market approach centered around the Paperless Ministry offering, the goal is to achieve global niche leadership and secure a strong foundation for future growth. To support this, cBrain is building an internal team, dedicated to export the F2 Paperless Ministry solution globally. During the first half year, cBrain has taken a number of important steps in the market. In Kenya, cBrain has successfully configured F2 for the Kenyan ICT Ministry, ready-to-go live within only 10 weeks. This was achieved by copying and adapting the F2 configuration used by the Danish ministries. In June, the Kenyan ICT Ministry revealed plans to roll out the F2 digital platform across all government departments, thereby transitioning into paperless working environments. The Kenyan project stands out as a strong reference for cBrain when engaging with potential ministerial customers in other parts of the world. Working in close collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP, cBrain plans to market the African version of the F2 Paperless Ministry across Africa. Many African government organizations focus on digitization as a key driver of GDP growth and as a foundation for building accountable and sustainable institutions. With the African Paperless Ministry solution, configured and proven through the Danish-Kenyan ministerial collaboration, cBrain now offers the African region a unique, secure, and fast track to digital transformation, while addressing a large number of potential government customers. During the spring, cBrain has further developed the collaboration with the UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi, and in March cBrain presented the African initiatives, which are closely aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, at the United Nations Science and Technology conference in New York. cBrain has a special focus on Germany and has established initial contacts with a number of German ministries at both federal and regional level. The new German government leadership has a strong focus on digitization, and cBrain believes that reusing Danish government experiences can help accelerate German government digital transformation. In Denmark, cBrain recently announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality to deliver the paperless ministry solution for one of the municipality departments. This agreement indicates a larger market, beyond the initial focus at federal ministries, delivering the paperless ministry solution for local government. Advancing digital sovereignty with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs Driven by the new and rapidly changing global geopolitical situation, digital sovereignty is becoming increasingly important for governments across the world. During the spring, cBrain entered into collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the government’s ambition of strengthening digital sovereignty. As part of this initiative, the Ministry launched a pilot project to test the use of open-source document editing integrated into the cBrain F2 platform. Technically, the cBrain F2 platform is built on an open architecture that separates data from editing tools. This design supports digital sovereignty by giving government users the freedom to use multiple types of editing software in parallel. The project is driven by the political objective of reducing dependency on international software vendors. Leveraging F2’s open architecture, the pilot enables ministry staff to work with open-source editing tools such as Collabora, while ensuring full data integrity, template compliance, and seamless collaboration across environments. Through this work, cBrain demonstrates how F2 supports digital sovereignty by offering governments an open and flexible platform that allows freedom of choice regarding editing tools, without compromising on security. The outcome of this pilot may serve as a blueprint for other ministries in Denmark and abroad, further strengthening cBrain’s position as a trusted partner for governments seeking independence in their digital infrastructures. Building a global Environmental Permitting market vertical As a second pillar of its expanded growth strategy, cBrain has identified environmental permitting as a key international vertical, aiming to establish a leading global position in this market with the cBrain F2 Environmental Permitting solution. The importance of environmental assessment and permitting grows globally, and governments are increasingly requiring robust review and approval processes for infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, mines, factories, and power plants. This trend creates a significant market opportunity for cBrain. In collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cBrain has developed a fully digital permitting solution based on the cBrain F2 platform. This solution replaces traditional paper-based applications, reduces case processing times, and enhances both quality and transparency. In July 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a report to Congress that assesses and recommends technologies to improve environmental reviews and permitting processes. In this report, the cBrain F2 Platform was highlighted as a successful process and AI tool for environmental permitting. To support international scaling, cBrain has formed a dedicated team focused on exporting the F2 Environmental Permitting solution and views environmental permitting as a strategic entry point into the U.S. market. cBrain seeks to capitalize on first-mover advantage in the environmental permitting market The White House issued in April 2025 an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to adopt digital technologies to streamline environmental permitting. 30 days later, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released the Permitting Technology Action Plan and introduced a new set of federal data standards for digital permitting systems. cBrain has rapidly configured its F2 Environmental Permitting solution to align with these standards and, in July 2025, cBrain demonstrated the adapted solution to U.S. federal authorities in Washington, D.C. cBrain believes it is among the very first vendors to support the new CEQ standards. This early alignment provides a first-mover advantage, and cBrain is experiencing an increased interest in its permitting technology as federal and state agencies are seeking to provide answers to political demand for faster permitting through digital modernization. Continued success in Denmark The Danish market represents a strong international reference position for cBrain, today serving more than 75 Danish government organizations with a large catalog of citizen-facing solutions, from tax solutions and auditing to grants management, inspections, licensing, and family affairs. cBrain continues to win market shares in Denmark. New Danish Ministry ready to go live within 3 Weeks In January, cBrain announced an agreement to deliver the F2 Paperless Ministry solution for the new Danish Ministry of Resilience and Preparedness. F2 ministry solution was installed and configured, ready to go live in only 3 weeks. This project demonstrates the power of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for government solutions. Using traditional software solution architectures, digitizing an entire ministry normally takes years and often fails. In contrast, the cBrain F2 platform offers a secure and cost efficient solution that can be easily configured to support fast track digital transformation within a matter of weeks. Demonstrating the speed of delivery and expanding the Danish reference position directly supports the aim to take global leadership, supplying the F2 Paperless Ministry solution. Danish Energy Agency goes live with heat pump grant system, approving first applications in minutes With references across multiple Danish agencies, cBrain is building a solid market position supplying F2 based solutions for grant management. In March, the Danish Energy Agency successfully launched its new digital grant management approval system for the heat pump subsidy program, delivering fast and efficient results beyond expectations. The new grant management solution is based on the cBrain F2 platform, which has been configured to support, all steps end-to-end, from self-service to case processing, evaluation, and filing. According to agency executives the system exceeded all expectations. During the first minutes, the F2 Based solution automatically granted approval to 930 of the applicants. Due to automated case processing steps, combined with automated integrations into multiple national registers, the grant process has been fully automated for the majority of applications. Now only cases that need more information and special evaluation require manual interaction. The successful launch of the heat pump subsidy system underscores how smart technology, like the F2 COTS for government platform, can support faster, smarter, and more effective public services, accelerating Denmark’s green transition. Third largest Danish Municipality implements the F2 Paperless Ministry solution Early July, cBrain announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality. cBrain will deliver F2 as a digital platform to the Urban and Rural Affairs Department in Aalborg Municipality. This administration is responsible for areas including urban development, construction, infrastructure, mobility and nature, and the implementation is expected to be completed within 6–8 weeks, with a planned go-live by September/October 2025. With this agreement, cBrain is now delivering the F2 platform for the three largest municipalities in Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Fully integrated and delivered out-of-the-box, cBrain F2 supports executive decision-making, formal and informal communication, case management, workflows, and compliance. Today, Copenhagen represents the largest deployment, with more than 3,000 users. The agreement with Aalborg highlights that the F2 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Government Platform is gaining traction not only among national ministries and agencies but also within large, complex local government organizations. Local governments thereby represent a significant market opportunity beyond the initial central government focus on Paperless Ministry, extending the reach of the cBrain F2 Paperless Government Platform to cities and local authorities internationally. In Denmark, cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution for the Danish Agency for Green Transition and Aquatic Environment. Delivered as one fully integrated platform, F2 has been configured to support all user requirements functionality, end-to-end. Highly automated, this includes self-service and portal for more than 180,000 hunters, a registry of hunters, case processing related to issuing hunting license, managing different hunting tests for different types of weapons, game harvest reporting, police security checks, and license payments. The project demonstrates the breadth of the F2 COTS for government platform. Delivered as one fully integrated solution, F2 is able to support national registers, case processing, self-service and mass operations such as billing and payment collection. F2 for Partners The F2-for-Partners strategy is a core element of the long-term growth plan. By establishing an ecosystem of partners and customers who manage the consulting work related to implementing and servicing F2 solutions, cBrain can scale its business without revenue growth being directly constrained by the burden of organizational expansion. At the core of this strategy are the F2 Service Builder no-code configuration tools. The F2 Service Builder allows local partners and governments to independently design and build F2-based government solutions. Solutions are configured using a spreadsheet interface, enabling users without a technical background to create solutions. The configured solutions are stored as open source definitions in so-called process libraries. The combination of open source and process libraries makes it easy to reuse solutions simply by copying and adapting the process definition source code. The F2 Service Builder technology thus enables rapid development and reuse, helping governments accelerate digital transformation and scale solutions efficiently. Working with UNDP, aligning with the Digital offer for Africa strategy In November 2024, UNDP and cBrain signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, the partnership aims to accelerate digital transformation of governments and their citizens in the African region. During the spring, cBrain has initiated an F2 process library at UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi. Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars. When the partnership was announced, Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa Director, stated: “Digital is the lifeline to opportunity in Africa, and it should not remain a luxury. With the right partners like Denmark and cBrain, we can expand critical access to information and education, and unlock innovation at scale, thus bridging divides and empowering millions to shape a more equal and prosperous future in Africa”. In parallel, the Ambassador of Denmark in Nairobi, Stephan Schönemann, stated: “cBrain is a leading Danish software company, promoting digitalization as a driver for good governance. Their collaboration with UNDP can help drive the sustainable development and digital transformation across the African continent. This collaboration echoes the spirit of the Danish government’s new Africa strategy which places a strong emphasis on technology, public-private partnerships, democracy, and knowledge sharing”. First large scale project in Romania In December 2024, cBrain’s partner in Romania, Wing Leading Edge, has won a public tender to deliver a new national platform for administering citizen pensions. The solution is being delivered in the Romanian language, with cBrain operating as a sub-supplier. Using the F2 Service Builder and process libraries, F2 is now being configured as the case management and processing core, supporting close to 100 different administrative processes and integrating with multiple other systems. cBrain sees the Romanian pension project as a milestone both technically and strategically. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the F2 Service Builder and process library technology, and it highlights the early success of the F2-for-Partners strategy. F2 AI Assistant offers government AI on premise AI is emerging as a transformative technology for governments worldwide. For cBrain, AI is not a separate product but an integrated part of our strategy to deliver Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for government. We embed AI directly into the F2 platform, ensuring that it supports caseworkers and managers in their daily work, and due to our unique technology, the F2 Assistant runs on premise, thereby safeguarding the principles of security, transparency, and data sovereignty. We continue to develop the F2 AI Assistant, adding new capabilities during the first half new capability. Operating fully within the secure F2 environment, the AI Assistant can summarize documents, propose case-relevant actions, and support knowledge sharing across organizations, always under the control and without compromising sovereignty. We see AI not only as a driver of efficiency but also as a catalyst for redefining digital government operations, further strengthening F2 as a category-defining standard in the global COTS software for government industry. Shaping the future of government software Already into the last quarters of our 2023–2025 growth plan, we are very encouraged by the progress. With a strong product position and strong customers references, supported by a solid financial position, we see cBrain well-positioned for the decade ahead. We are confident that our strategy, built on taking leadership in COTS for government industry, will enable us to capture the opportunities of a fast-emerging market and secure long-term, sustainable growth.

We see standard software for government evolving into a large industry, challenging the dominance of traditional suppliers. With more than 15 years of experience, a strong product position, and solid customer references, we look confidently toward the next decade. We aim to take a leadership position within the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for government industry, and we have refined our strategy accordingly. Our dual go-to-market approach balances depth with focus: we continue to build our core business around large account customers (“super accounts”), while in parallel pursuing global leadership in selected niches where F2 becomes a category-defining standard. With F2, we are shaping the future of COTS for government. Our product roadmap is driven by a unique technology position: a complete and fully integrated platform, standard software purpose-built for government, while offering easy configuration to meet customer requirements without any modification to the core software. We maintain our full year guidance Revenue for the first half of 2025 amounts to DKK 132 million, this is down 5% from DKK 139 million in the same period of 2024. Earnings before tax (EBT) total DKK 31 million, corresponding to an EBT margin of 24%. Software revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 100 million, a decrease of 10% compared to DKK 111 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower international license sales. Revenue from one-time software licenses declined by 58%, making up 14% of total revenue. Services revenue increased by 15% to DKK 32 million, representing 24% of total revenue. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) grew by 24% and represent 61% of total revenue, up from approximately 47% last year. While revenue for the first half of the year was lower due to a decline in one-time software license sales, we are encouraged by the solid performance of recurring revenue streams. The first half demonstrates a strong underlying business, with subscriptions growing 24% and services revenue increasing 15%. In addition, the solid EBT margin of 24% generated a strong positive operating cash flow of DKK 40 million. The one-time software license decline, reflects timing-related factors and market-specific delays. Given the short delivery cycles for one-time licenses, revenue is directly impacted by fluctuations in procurement schedules. In the second quarter, some Danish government organizations postponed procurements due to internal planning processes and resort changes, affecting the timing of recognized revenue. Similar to Denmark, delays in international projects have impacted results, representing a key driver of lower one-time license revenue. We maintain our full-year guidance, growing revenue 10-15% with an EBT margin of 18-23%. For the second half, we forecast continued growth in recurring licenses, and expect one-time licenses to reach a level that secures the same total volume of one-time licenses in 2025 as in 2024. In Denmark, we expect postponed procurements to be completed. Internationally, we anticipate projects across the USA, Germany, the UAE, and Africa to drive growth in one-time license revenue. Focused on long-term growth through strategic investments During the spring, cBrain (NASDAQ: CBRAIN) has taken internal steps to strengthen its organization with the aim of taking a leadership position in the fast-emerging global market for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for governments. This includes developing go-to-market strategies and establishing dedicated teams to build and lead global niches such as paperless ministry and environmental permitting. During the first half year, cBrain has been able to report progress in both verticals, with the Kenyan ministry of ICT running a pilot project and supporting the new U.S. government standard for environmental permitting. We believe the global COTS for government opportunity is significant. We have therefore also adopted a long-term perspective, even if this may affect short-term performance. cBrain has the financial strength to execute on this strategy. These changes have influenced the first half results, as we are reallocating project resources. In the beginning of the year, we allocated extra costs of 30 million DKK to support the organizational development and market investments. Until now we have allocated a smaller part of these investments, and we continue to evaluate opportunities. Thriving toward global leadership in the Paperless Ministry market The setup and configuration of cBrain F2 ® for ministries, used by Danish ministries as their digital platform, is referred to as the Paperless Ministry solution. A key pillar of the expanded growth strategy is to replicate the Danish success, and with Denmark ranked number one in the United Nations E-Government Survey for the past eight years, cBrain holds a strong reference position when exporting the Paperless Ministry solution. By establishing beachheads in new international markets, based on a vertical go-to-market approach centered around the Paperless Ministry offering, the goal is to achieve global niche leadership and secure a strong foundation for future growth. To support this, cBrain is building an internal team, dedicated to export the F2 Paperless Ministry solution globally. During the first half year, cBrain has taken a number of important steps in the market. In Kenya, cBrain has successfully configured F2 for the Kenyan ICT Ministry, ready-to-go live within only 10 weeks. This was achieved by copying and adapting the F2 configuration used by the Danish ministries. In June, the Kenyan ICT Ministry revealed plans to roll out the F2 digital platform across all government departments, thereby transitioning into paperless working environments. The Kenyan project stands out as a strong reference for cBrain when engaging with potential ministerial customers in other parts of the world. Working in close collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP, cBrain plans to market the African version of the F2 Paperless Ministry across Africa. Many African government organizations focus on digitization as a key driver of GDP growth and as a foundation for building accountable and sustainable institutions. With the African Paperless Ministry solution, configured and proven through the Danish-Kenyan ministerial collaboration, cBrain now offers the African region a unique, secure, and fast track to digital transformation, while addressing a large number of potential government customers. During the spring, cBrain has further developed the collaboration with the UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi, and in March cBrain presented the African initiatives, which are closely aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, at the United Nations Science and Technology conference in New York. cBrain has a special focus on Germany and has established initial contacts with a number of German ministries at both federal and regional level. The new German government leadership has a strong focus on digitization, and cBrain believes that reusing Danish government experiences can help accelerate German government digital transformation. In Denmark, cBrain recently announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality to deliver the paperless ministry solution for one of the municipality departments. This agreement indicates a larger market, beyond the initial focus at federal ministries, delivering the paperless ministry solution for local government.

Our dual go-to-market approach balances depth with focus: we continue to build our core business around large account customers (“super accounts”), while in parallel pursuing global leadership in selected niches where F2 becomes a category-defining standard. With F2, we are shaping the future of COTS for government. Our product roadmap is driven by a unique technology position: a complete and fully integrated platform, standard software purpose-built for government, while offering easy configuration to meet customer requirements without any modification to the core software. We maintain our full year guidance Revenue for the first half of 2025 amounts to DKK 132 million, this is down 5% from DKK 139 million in the same period of 2024. Earnings before tax (EBT) total DKK 31 million, corresponding to an EBT margin of 24%. Software revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 100 million, a decrease of 10% compared to DKK 111 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower international license sales. Revenue from one-time software licenses declined by 58%, making up 14% of total revenue. Services revenue increased by 15% to DKK 32 million, representing 24% of total revenue. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) grew by 24% and represent 61% of total revenue, up from approximately 47% last year. While revenue for the first half of the year was lower due to a decline in one-time software license sales, we are encouraged by the solid performance of recurring revenue streams. The first half demonstrates a strong underlying business, with subscriptions growing 24% and services revenue increasing 15%. In addition, the solid EBT margin of 24% generated a strong positive operating cash flow of DKK 40 million. The one-time software license decline, reflects timing-related factors and market-specific delays. Given the short delivery cycles for one-time licenses, revenue is directly impacted by fluctuations in procurement schedules. In the second quarter, some Danish government organizations postponed procurements due to internal planning processes and resort changes, affecting the timing of recognized revenue. Similar to Denmark, delays in international projects have impacted results, representing a key driver of lower one-time license revenue. We maintain our full-year guidance, growing revenue 10-15% with an EBT margin of 18-23%. For the second half, we forecast continued growth in recurring licenses, and expect one-time licenses to reach a level that secures the same total volume of one-time licenses in 2025 as in 2024. In Denmark, we expect postponed procurements to be completed. Internationally, we anticipate projects across the USA, Germany, the UAE, and Africa to drive growth in one-time license revenue. Focused on long-term growth through strategic investments During the spring, cBrain (NASDAQ: CBRAIN) has taken internal steps to strengthen its organization with the aim of taking a leadership position in the fast-emerging global market for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for governments. This includes developing go-to-market strategies and establishing dedicated teams to build and lead global niches such as paperless ministry and environmental permitting. During the first half year, cBrain has been able to report progress in both verticals, with the Kenyan ministry of ICT running a pilot project and supporting the new U.S. government standard for environmental permitting. We believe the global COTS for government opportunity is significant. We have therefore also adopted a long-term perspective, even if this may affect short-term performance. cBrain has the financial strength to execute on this strategy. These changes have influenced the first half results, as we are reallocating project resources. In the beginning of the year, we allocated extra costs of 30 million DKK to support the organizational development and market investments. Until now we have allocated a smaller part of these investments, and we continue to evaluate opportunities. Thriving toward global leadership in the Paperless Ministry market The setup and configuration of cBrain F2 ® for ministries, used by Danish ministries as their digital platform, is referred to as the Paperless Ministry solution. A key pillar of the expanded growth strategy is to replicate the Danish success, and with Denmark ranked number one in the United Nations E-Government Survey for the past eight years, cBrain holds a strong reference position when exporting the Paperless Ministry solution. By establishing beachheads in new international markets, based on a vertical go-to-market approach centered around the Paperless Ministry offering, the goal is to achieve global niche leadership and secure a strong foundation for future growth. To support this, cBrain is building an internal team, dedicated to export the F2 Paperless Ministry solution globally. During the first half year, cBrain has taken a number of important steps in the market. In Kenya, cBrain has successfully configured F2 for the Kenyan ICT Ministry, ready-to-go live within only 10 weeks. This was achieved by copying and adapting the F2 configuration used by the Danish ministries. In June, the Kenyan ICT Ministry revealed plans to roll out the F2 digital platform across all government departments, thereby transitioning into paperless working environments. The Kenyan project stands out as a strong reference for cBrain when engaging with potential ministerial customers in other parts of the world. Working in close collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP, cBrain plans to market the African version of the F2 Paperless Ministry across Africa. Many African government organizations focus on digitization as a key driver of GDP growth and as a foundation for building accountable and sustainable institutions. With the African Paperless Ministry solution, configured and proven through the Danish-Kenyan ministerial collaboration, cBrain now offers the African region a unique, secure, and fast track to digital transformation, while addressing a large number of potential government customers. During the spring, cBrain has further developed the collaboration with the UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi, and in March cBrain presented the African initiatives, which are closely aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, at the United Nations Science and Technology conference in New York. cBrain has a special focus on Germany and has established initial contacts with a number of German ministries at both federal and regional level. The new German government leadership has a strong focus on digitization, and cBrain believes that reusing Danish government experiences can help accelerate German government digital transformation. In Denmark, cBrain recently announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality to deliver the paperless ministry solution for one of the municipality departments. This agreement indicates a larger market, beyond the initial focus at federal ministries, delivering the paperless ministry solution for local government. Advancing digital sovereignty with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs Driven by the new and rapidly changing global geopolitical situation, digital sovereignty is becoming increasingly important for governments across the world. During the spring, cBrain entered into collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the government’s ambition of strengthening digital sovereignty. As part of this initiative, the Ministry launched a pilot project to test the use of open-source document editing integrated into the cBrain F2 platform. Technically, the cBrain F2 platform is built on an open architecture that separates data from editing tools. This design supports digital sovereignty by giving government users the freedom to use multiple types of editing software in parallel. The project is driven by the political objective of reducing dependency on international software vendors. Leveraging F2’s open architecture, the pilot enables ministry staff to work with open-source editing tools such as Collabora, while ensuring full data integrity, template compliance, and seamless collaboration across environments. Through this work, cBrain demonstrates how F2 supports digital sovereignty by offering governments an open and flexible platform that allows freedom of choice regarding editing tools, without compromising on security. The outcome of this pilot may serve as a blueprint for other ministries in Denmark and abroad, further strengthening cBrain’s position as a trusted partner for governments seeking independence in their digital infrastructures. Building a global Environmental Permitting market vertical As a second pillar of its expanded growth strategy, cBrain has identified environmental permitting as a key international vertical, aiming to establish a leading global position in this market with the cBrain F2 Environmental Permitting solution. The importance of environmental assessment and permitting grows globally, and governments are increasingly requiring robust review and approval processes for infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, mines, factories, and power plants. This trend creates a significant market opportunity for cBrain. In collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cBrain has developed a fully digital permitting solution based on the cBrain F2 platform. This solution replaces traditional paper-based applications, reduces case processing times, and enhances both quality and transparency. In July 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a report to Congress that assesses and recommends technologies to improve environmental reviews and permitting processes. In this report, the cBrain F2 Platform was highlighted as a successful process and AI tool for environmental permitting. To support international scaling, cBrain has formed a dedicated team focused on exporting the F2 Environmental Permitting solution and views environmental permitting as a strategic entry point into the U.S. market. cBrain seeks to capitalize on first-mover advantage in the environmental permitting market The White House issued in April 2025 an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to adopt digital technologies to streamline environmental permitting. 30 days later, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released the Permitting Technology Action Plan and introduced a new set of federal data standards for digital permitting systems. cBrain has rapidly configured its F2 Environmental Permitting solution to align with these standards and, in July 2025, cBrain demonstrated the adapted solution to U.S. federal authorities in Washington, D.C. cBrain believes it is among the very first vendors to support the new CEQ standards. This early alignment provides a first-mover advantage, and cBrain is experiencing an increased interest in its permitting technology as federal and state agencies are seeking to provide answers to political demand for faster permitting through digital modernization. Continued success in Denmark The Danish market represents a strong international reference position for cBrain, today serving more than 75 Danish government organizations with a large catalog of citizen-facing solutions, from tax solutions and auditing to grants management, inspections, licensing, and family affairs. cBrain continues to win market shares in Denmark. New Danish Ministry ready to go live within 3 Weeks In January, cBrain announced an agreement to deliver the F2 Paperless Ministry solution for the new Danish Ministry of Resilience and Preparedness. F2 ministry solution was installed and configured, ready to go live in only 3 weeks. This project demonstrates the power of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for government solutions. Using traditional software solution architectures, digitizing an entire ministry normally takes years and often fails. In contrast, the cBrain F2 platform offers a secure and cost efficient solution that can be easily configured to support fast track digital transformation within a matter of weeks. Demonstrating the speed of delivery and expanding the Danish reference position directly supports the aim to take global leadership, supplying the F2 Paperless Ministry solution. Danish Energy Agency goes live with heat pump grant system, approving first applications in minutes With references across multiple Danish agencies, cBrain is building a solid market position supplying F2 based solutions for grant management. In March, the Danish Energy Agency successfully launched its new digital grant management approval system for the heat pump subsidy program, delivering fast and efficient results beyond expectations. The new grant management solution is based on the cBrain F2 platform, which has been configured to support, all steps end-to-end, from self-service to case processing, evaluation, and filing. According to agency executives the system exceeded all expectations. During the first minutes, the F2 Based solution automatically granted approval to 930 of the applicants. Due to automated case processing steps, combined with automated integrations into multiple national registers, the grant process has been fully automated for the majority of applications. Now only cases that need more information and special evaluation require manual interaction. The successful launch of the heat pump subsidy system underscores how smart technology, like the F2 COTS for government platform, can support faster, smarter, and more effective public services, accelerating Denmark’s green transition. Third largest Danish Municipality implements the F2 Paperless Ministry solution Early July, cBrain announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality. cBrain will deliver F2 as a digital platform to the Urban and Rural Affairs Department in Aalborg Municipality. This administration is responsible for areas including urban development, construction, infrastructure, mobility and nature, and the implementation is expected to be completed within 6–8 weeks, with a planned go-live by September/October 2025. With this agreement, cBrain is now delivering the F2 platform for the three largest municipalities in Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Fully integrated and delivered out-of-the-box, cBrain F2 supports executive decision-making, formal and informal communication, case management, workflows, and compliance. Today, Copenhagen represents the largest deployment, with more than 3,000 users. The agreement with Aalborg highlights that the F2 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Government Platform is gaining traction not only among national ministries and agencies but also within large, complex local government organizations. Local governments thereby represent a significant market opportunity beyond the initial central government focus on Paperless Ministry, extending the reach of the cBrain F2 Paperless Government Platform to cities and local authorities internationally. In Denmark, cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution for the Danish Agency for Green Transition and Aquatic Environment. Delivered as one fully integrated platform, F2 has been configured to support all user requirements functionality, end-to-end. Highly automated, this includes self-service and portal for more than 180,000 hunters, a registry of hunters, case processing related to issuing hunting license, managing different hunting tests for different types of weapons, game harvest reporting, police security checks, and license payments. The project demonstrates the breadth of the F2 COTS for government platform. Delivered as one fully integrated solution, F2 is able to support national registers, case processing, self-service and mass operations such as billing and payment collection. F2 for Partners The F2-for-Partners strategy is a core element of the long-term growth plan. By establishing an ecosystem of partners and customers who manage the consulting work related to implementing and servicing F2 solutions, cBrain can scale its business without revenue growth being directly constrained by the burden of organizational expansion. At the core of this strategy are the F2 Service Builder no-code configuration tools. The F2 Service Builder allows local partners and governments to independently design and build F2-based government solutions. Solutions are configured using a spreadsheet interface, enabling users without a technical background to create solutions. The configured solutions are stored as open source definitions in so-called process libraries. The combination of open source and process libraries makes it easy to reuse solutions simply by copying and adapting the process definition source code. The F2 Service Builder technology thus enables rapid development and reuse, helping governments accelerate digital transformation and scale solutions efficiently. Working with UNDP, aligning with the Digital offer for Africa strategy In November 2024, UNDP and cBrain signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, the partnership aims to accelerate digital transformation of governments and their citizens in the African region. During the spring, cBrain has initiated an F2 process library at UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi. Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars. When the partnership was announced, Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa Director, stated: “Digital is the lifeline to opportunity in Africa, and it should not remain a luxury. With the right partners like Denmark and cBrain, we can expand critical access to information and education, and unlock innovation at scale, thus bridging divides and empowering millions to shape a more equal and prosperous future in Africa”. In parallel, the Ambassador of Denmark in Nairobi, Stephan Schönemann, stated: “cBrain is a leading Danish software company, promoting digitalization as a driver for good governance. Their collaboration with UNDP can help drive the sustainable development and digital transformation across the African continent. This collaboration echoes the spirit of the Danish government’s new Africa strategy which places a strong emphasis on technology, public-private partnerships, democracy, and knowledge sharing”. First large scale project in Romania In December 2024, cBrain’s partner in Romania, Wing Leading Edge, has won a public tender to deliver a new national platform for administering citizen pensions. The solution is being delivered in the Romanian language, with cBrain operating as a sub-supplier. Using the F2 Service Builder and process libraries, F2 is now being configured as the case management and processing core, supporting close to 100 different administrative processes and integrating with multiple other systems. cBrain sees the Romanian pension project as a milestone both technically and strategically. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the F2 Service Builder and process library technology, and it highlights the early success of the F2-for-Partners strategy. F2 AI Assistant offers government AI on premise AI is emerging as a transformative technology for governments worldwide. For cBrain, AI is not a separate product but an integrated part of our strategy to deliver Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for government. We embed AI directly into the F2 platform, ensuring that it supports caseworkers and managers in their daily work, and due to our unique technology, the F2 Assistant runs on premise, thereby safeguarding the principles of security, transparency, and data sovereignty. We continue to develop the F2 AI Assistant, adding new capabilities during the first half new capability. Operating fully within the secure F2 environment, the AI Assistant can summarize documents, propose case-relevant actions, and support knowledge sharing across organizations, always under the control and without compromising sovereignty. We see AI not only as a driver of efficiency but also as a catalyst for redefining digital government operations, further strengthening F2 as a category-defining standard in the global COTS software for government industry. Shaping the future of government software Already into the last quarters of our 2023–2025 growth plan, we are very encouraged by the progress. With a strong product position and strong customers references, supported by a solid financial position, we see cBrain well-positioned for the decade ahead. We are confident that our strategy, built on taking leadership in COTS for government industry, will enable us to capture the opportunities of a fast-emerging market and secure long-term, sustainable growth.

Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars. When the partnership was announced, Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa Director, stated: “Digital is the lifeline to opportunity in Africa, and it should not remain a luxury. With the right partners like Denmark and cBrain, we can expand critical access to information and education, and unlock innovation at scale, thus bridging divides and empowering millions to shape a more equal and prosperous future in Africa”. In parallel, the Ambassador of Denmark in Nairobi, Stephan Schönemann, stated: “cBrain is a leading Danish software company, promoting digitalization as a driver for good governance. Their collaboration with UNDP can help drive the sustainable development and digital transformation across the African continent. This collaboration echoes the spirit of the Danish government’s new Africa strategy which places a strong emphasis on technology, public-private partnerships, democracy, and knowledge sharing”. First large scale project in Romania In December 2024, cBrain’s partner in Romania, Wing Leading Edge, has won a public tender to deliver a new national platform for administering citizen pensions. The solution is being delivered in the Romanian language, with cBrain operating as a sub-supplier. Using the F2 Service Builder and process libraries, F2 is now being configured as the case management and processing core, supporting close to 100 different administrative processes and integrating with multiple other systems. cBrain sees the Romanian pension project as a milestone both technically and strategically. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the F2 Service Builder and process library technology, and it highlights the early success of the F2-for-Partners strategy. F2 AI Assistant offers government AI on premise AI is emerging as a transformative technology for governments worldwide. For cBrain, AI is not a separate product but an integrated part of our strategy to deliver Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for government. We embed AI directly into the F2 platform, ensuring that it supports caseworkers and managers in their daily work, and due to our unique technology, the F2 Assistant runs on premise, thereby safeguarding the principles of security, transparency, and data sovereignty. We continue to develop the F2 AI Assistant, adding new capabilities during the first half new capability. Operating fully within the secure F2 environment, the AI Assistant can summarize documents, propose case-relevant actions, and support knowledge sharing across organizations, always under the control and without compromising sovereignty. We see AI not only as a driver of efficiency but also as a catalyst for redefining digital government operations, further strengthening F2 as a category-defining standard in the global COTS software for government industry. Shaping the future of government software Already into the last quarters of our 2023–2025 growth plan, we are very encouraged by the progress. With a strong product position and strong customers references, supported by a solid financial position, we see cBrain well-positioned for the decade ahead. We are confident that our strategy, built on taking leadership in COTS for government industry, will enable us to capture the opportunities of a fast-emerging market and secure long-term, sustainable growth.

We see standard software for government evolving into a large industry, challenging the dominance of traditional suppliers. With more than 15 years of experience, a strong product position, and solid customer references, we look confidently toward the next decade. We aim to take a leadership position within the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for government industry, and we have refined our strategy accordingly. Our dual go-to-market approach balances depth with focus: we continue to build our core business around large account customers (“super accounts”), while in parallel pursuing global leadership in selected niches where F2 becomes a category-defining standard. With F2, we are shaping the future of COTS for government. Our product roadmap is driven by a unique technology position: a complete and fully integrated platform, standard software purpose-built for government, while offering easy configuration to meet customer requirements without any modification to the core software. We maintain our full year guidance Revenue for the first half of 2025 amounts to DKK 132 million, this is down 5% from DKK 139 million in the same period of 2024. Earnings before tax (EBT) total DKK 31 million, corresponding to an EBT margin of 24%. Software revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 100 million, a decrease of 10% compared to DKK 111 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower international license sales. Revenue from one-time software licenses declined by 58%, making up 14% of total revenue. Services revenue increased by 15% to DKK 32 million, representing 24% of total revenue. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) grew by 24% and represent 61% of total revenue, up from approximately 47% last year. While revenue for the first half of the year was lower due to a decline in one-time software license sales, we are encouraged by the solid performance of recurring revenue streams. The first half demonstrates a strong underlying business, with subscriptions growing 24% and services revenue increasing 15%. In addition, the solid EBT margin of 24% generated a strong positive operating cash flow of DKK 40 million. The one-time software license decline, reflects timing-related factors and market-specific delays. Given the short delivery cycles for one-time licenses, revenue is directly impacted by fluctuations in procurement schedules. In the second quarter, some Danish government organizations postponed procurements due to internal planning processes and resort changes, affecting the timing of recognized revenue. Similar to Denmark, delays in international projects have impacted results, representing a key driver of lower one-time license revenue. We maintain our full-year guidance, growing revenue 10-15% with an EBT margin of 18-23%. For the second half, we forecast continued growth in recurring licenses, and expect one-time licenses to reach a level that secures the same total volume of one-time licenses in 2025 as in 2024. In Denmark, we expect postponed procurements to be completed. Internationally, we anticipate projects across the USA, Germany, the UAE, and Africa to drive growth in one-time license revenue. Focused on long-term growth through strategic investments During the spring, cBrain (NASDAQ: CBRAIN) has taken internal steps to strengthen its organization with the aim of taking a leadership position in the fast-emerging global market for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for governments. This includes developing go-to-market strategies and establishing dedicated teams to build and lead global niches such as paperless ministry and environmental permitting. During the first half year, cBrain has been able to report progress in both verticals, with the Kenyan ministry of ICT running a pilot project and supporting the new U.S. government standard for environmental permitting. We believe the global COTS for government opportunity is significant. We have therefore also adopted a long-term perspective, even if this may affect short-term performance. cBrain has the financial strength to execute on this strategy. These changes have influenced the first half results, as we are reallocating project resources. In the beginning of the year, we allocated extra costs of 30 million DKK to support the organizational development and market investments. Until now we have allocated a smaller part of these investments, and we continue to evaluate opportunities. Thriving toward global leadership in the Paperless Ministry market The setup and configuration of cBrain F2 ® for ministries, used by Danish ministries as their digital platform, is referred to as the Paperless Ministry solution. A key pillar of the expanded growth strategy is to replicate the Danish success, and with Denmark ranked number one in the United Nations E-Government Survey for the past eight years, cBrain holds a strong reference position when exporting the Paperless Ministry solution. By establishing beachheads in new international markets, based on a vertical go-to-market approach centered around the Paperless Ministry offering, the goal is to achieve global niche leadership and secure a strong foundation for future growth. To support this, cBrain is building an internal team, dedicated to export the F2 Paperless Ministry solution globally. During the first half year, cBrain has taken a number of important steps in the market. In Kenya, cBrain has successfully configured F2 for the Kenyan ICT Ministry, ready-to-go live within only 10 weeks. This was achieved by copying and adapting the F2 configuration used by the Danish ministries. In June, the Kenyan ICT Ministry revealed plans to roll out the F2 digital platform across all government departments, thereby transitioning into paperless working environments. The Kenyan project stands out as a strong reference for cBrain when engaging with potential ministerial customers in other parts of the world. Working in close collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP, cBrain plans to market the African version of the F2 Paperless Ministry across Africa. Many African government organizations focus on digitization as a key driver of GDP growth and as a foundation for building accountable and sustainable institutions. With the African Paperless Ministry solution, configured and proven through the Danish-Kenyan ministerial collaboration, cBrain now offers the African region a unique, secure, and fast track to digital transformation, while addressing a large number of potential government customers. During the spring, cBrain has further developed the collaboration with the UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi, and in March cBrain presented the African initiatives, which are closely aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, at the United Nations Science and Technology conference in New York. cBrain has a special focus on Germany and has established initial contacts with a number of German ministries at both federal and regional level. The new German government leadership has a strong focus on digitization, and cBrain believes that reusing Danish government experiences can help accelerate German government digital transformation. In Denmark, cBrain recently announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality to deliver the paperless ministry solution for one of the municipality departments. This agreement indicates a larger market, beyond the initial focus at federal ministries, delivering the paperless ministry solution for local government. Advancing digital sovereignty with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs Driven by the new and rapidly changing global geopolitical situation, digital sovereignty is becoming increasingly important for governments across the world. During the spring, cBrain entered into collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the government’s ambition of strengthening digital sovereignty. As part of this initiative, the Ministry launched a pilot project to test the use of open-source document editing integrated into the cBrain F2 platform. Technically, the cBrain F2 platform is built on an open architecture that separates data from editing tools. This design supports digital sovereignty by giving government users the freedom to use multiple types of editing software in parallel. The project is driven by the political objective of reducing dependency on international software vendors. Leveraging F2’s open architecture, the pilot enables ministry staff to work with open-source editing tools such as Collabora, while ensuring full data integrity, template compliance, and seamless collaboration across environments. Through this work, cBrain demonstrates how F2 supports digital sovereignty by offering governments an open and flexible platform that allows freedom of choice regarding editing tools, without compromising on security. The outcome of this pilot may serve as a blueprint for other ministries in Denmark and abroad, further strengthening cBrain’s position as a trusted partner for governments seeking independence in their digital infrastructures. Building a global Environmental Permitting market vertical As a second pillar of its expanded growth strategy, cBrain has identified environmental permitting as a key international vertical, aiming to establish a leading global position in this market with the cBrain F2 Environmental Permitting solution. The importance of environmental assessment and permitting grows globally, and governments are increasingly requiring robust review and approval processes for infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, mines, factories, and power plants. This trend creates a significant market opportunity for cBrain. In collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cBrain has developed a fully digital permitting solution based on the cBrain F2 platform. This solution replaces traditional paper-based applications, reduces case processing times, and enhances both quality and transparency. In July 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a report to Congress that assesses and recommends technologies to improve environmental reviews and permitting processes. In this report, the cBrain F2 Platform was highlighted as a successful process and AI tool for environmental permitting. To support international scaling, cBrain has formed a dedicated team focused on exporting the F2 Environmental Permitting solution and views environmental permitting as a strategic entry point into the U.S. market. cBrain seeks to capitalize on first-mover advantage in the environmental permitting market The White House issued in April 2025 an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to adopt digital technologies to streamline environmental permitting. 30 days later, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released the Permitting Technology Action Plan and introduced a new set of federal data standards for digital permitting systems. cBrain has rapidly configured its F2 Environmental Permitting solution to align with these standards and, in July 2025, cBrain demonstrated the adapted solution to U.S. federal authorities in Washington, D.C. cBrain believes it is among the very first vendors to support the new CEQ standards. This early alignment provides a first-mover advantage, and cBrain is experiencing an increased interest in its permitting technology as federal and state agencies are seeking to provide answers to political demand for faster permitting through digital modernization. Continued success in Denmark The Danish market represents a strong international reference position for cBrain, today serving more than 75 Danish government organizations with a large catalog of citizen-facing solutions, from tax solutions and auditing to grants management, inspections, licensing, and family affairs. cBrain continues to win market shares in Denmark. New Danish Ministry ready to go live within 3 Weeks In January, cBrain announced an agreement to deliver the F2 Paperless Ministry solution for the new Danish Ministry of Resilience and Preparedness. F2 ministry solution was installed and configured, ready to go live in only 3 weeks. This project demonstrates the power of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for government solutions. Using traditional software solution architectures, digitizing an entire ministry normally takes years and often fails. In contrast, the cBrain F2 platform offers a secure and cost efficient solution that can be easily configured to support fast track digital transformation within a matter of weeks. Demonstrating the speed of delivery and expanding the Danish reference position directly supports the aim to take global leadership, supplying the F2 Paperless Ministry solution. Danish Energy Agency goes live with heat pump grant system, approving first applications in minutes With references across multiple Danish agencies, cBrain is building a solid market position supplying F2 based solutions for grant management. In March, the Danish Energy Agency successfully launched its new digital grant management approval system for the heat pump subsidy program, delivering fast and efficient results beyond expectations. The new grant management solution is based on the cBrain F2 platform, which has been configured to support, all steps end-to-end, from self-service to case processing, evaluation, and filing. According to agency executives the system exceeded all expectations. During the first minutes, the F2 Based solution automatically granted approval to 930 of the applicants. Due to automated case processing steps, combined with automated integrations into multiple national registers, the grant process has been fully automated for the majority of applications. Now only cases that need more information and special evaluation require manual interaction. The successful launch of the heat pump subsidy system underscores how smart technology, like the F2 COTS for government platform, can support faster, smarter, and more effective public services, accelerating Denmark’s green transition. Third largest Danish Municipality implements the F2 Paperless Ministry solution Early July, cBrain announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality. cBrain will deliver F2 as a digital platform to the Urban and Rural Affairs Department in Aalborg Municipality. This administration is responsible for areas including urban development, construction, infrastructure, mobility and nature, and the implementation is expected to be completed within 6–8 weeks, with a planned go-live by September/October 2025. With this agreement, cBrain is now delivering the F2 platform for the three largest municipalities in Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Fully integrated and delivered out-of-the-box, cBrain F2 supports executive decision-making, formal and informal communication, case management, workflows, and compliance. Today, Copenhagen represents the largest deployment, with more than 3,000 users. The agreement with Aalborg highlights that the F2 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Government Platform is gaining traction not only among national ministries and agencies but also within large, complex local government organizations. Local governments thereby represent a significant market opportunity beyond the initial central government focus on Paperless Ministry, extending the reach of the cBrain F2 Paperless Government Platform to cities and local authorities internationally. In Denmark, cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution for the Danish Agency for Green Transition and Aquatic Environment. Delivered as one fully integrated platform, F2 has been configured to support all user requirements functionality, end-to-end. Highly automated, this includes self-service and portal for more than 180,000 hunters, a registry of hunters, case processing related to issuing hunting license, managing different hunting tests for different types of weapons, game harvest reporting, police security checks, and license payments. The project demonstrates the breadth of the F2 COTS for government platform. Delivered as one fully integrated solution, F2 is able to support national registers, case processing, self-service and mass operations such as billing and payment collection. F2 for Partners The F2-for-Partners strategy is a core element of the long-term growth plan. By establishing an ecosystem of partners and customers who manage the consulting work related to implementing and servicing F2 solutions, cBrain can scale its business without revenue growth being directly constrained by the burden of organizational expansion. At the core of this strategy are the F2 Service Builder no-code configuration tools. The F2 Service Builder allows local partners and governments to independently design and build F2-based government solutions. Solutions are configured using a spreadsheet interface, enabling users without a technical background to create solutions. The configured solutions are stored as open source definitions in so-called process libraries. The combination of open source and process libraries makes it easy to reuse solutions simply by copying and adapting the process definition source code. The F2 Service Builder technology thus enables rapid development and reuse, helping governments accelerate digital transformation and scale solutions efficiently. Working with UNDP, aligning with the Digital offer for Africa strategy In November 2024, UNDP and cBrain signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, the partnership aims to accelerate digital transformation of governments and their citizens in the African region. During the spring, cBrain has initiated an F2 process library at UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi. Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars.

This early alignment provides a first-mover advantage, and cBrain is experiencing an increased interest in its permitting technology as federal and state agencies are seeking to provide answers to political demand for faster permitting through digital modernization. Continued success in Denmark The Danish market represents a strong international reference position for cBrain, today serving more than 75 Danish government organizations with a large catalog of citizen-facing solutions, from tax solutions and auditing to grants management, inspections, licensing, and family affairs. cBrain continues to win market shares in Denmark. New Danish Ministry ready to go live within 3 Weeks In January, cBrain announced an agreement to deliver the F2 Paperless Ministry solution for the new Danish Ministry of Resilience and Preparedness. F2 ministry solution was installed and configured, ready to go live in only 3 weeks. This project demonstrates the power of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for government solutions. Using traditional software solution architectures, digitizing an entire ministry normally takes years and often fails. In contrast, the cBrain F2 platform offers a secure and cost efficient solution that can be easily configured to support fast track digital transformation within a matter of weeks. Demonstrating the speed of delivery and expanding the Danish reference position directly supports the aim to take global leadership, supplying the F2 Paperless Ministry solution. Danish Energy Agency goes live with heat pump grant system, approving first applications in minutes With references across multiple Danish agencies, cBrain is building a solid market position supplying F2 based solutions for grant management. In March, the Danish Energy Agency successfully launched its new digital grant management approval system for the heat pump subsidy program, delivering fast and efficient results beyond expectations. The new grant management solution is based on the cBrain F2 platform, which has been configured to support, all steps end-to-end, from self-service to case processing, evaluation, and filing. According to agency executives the system exceeded all expectations. During the first minutes, the F2 Based solution automatically granted approval to 930 of the applicants. Due to automated case processing steps, combined with automated integrations into multiple national registers, the grant process has been fully automated for the majority of applications. Now only cases that need more information and special evaluation require manual interaction. The successful launch of the heat pump subsidy system underscores how smart technology, like the F2 COTS for government platform, can support faster, smarter, and more effective public services, accelerating Denmark’s green transition. Third largest Danish Municipality implements the F2 Paperless Ministry solution Early July, cBrain announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality. cBrain will deliver F2 as a digital platform to the Urban and Rural Affairs Department in Aalborg Municipality. This administration is responsible for areas including urban development, construction, infrastructure, mobility and nature, and the implementation is expected to be completed within 6–8 weeks, with a planned go-live by September/October 2025. With this agreement, cBrain is now delivering the F2 platform for the three largest municipalities in Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Fully integrated and delivered out-of-the-box, cBrain F2 supports executive decision-making, formal and informal communication, case management, workflows, and compliance. Today, Copenhagen represents the largest deployment, with more than 3,000 users. The agreement with Aalborg highlights that the F2 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Government Platform is gaining traction not only among national ministries and agencies but also within large, complex local government organizations. Local governments thereby represent a significant market opportunity beyond the initial central government focus on Paperless Ministry, extending the reach of the cBrain F2 Paperless Government Platform to cities and local authorities internationally. In Denmark, cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution for the Danish Agency for Green Transition and Aquatic Environment. Delivered as one fully integrated platform, F2 has been configured to support all user requirements functionality, end-to-end. Highly automated, this includes self-service and portal for more than 180,000 hunters, a registry of hunters, case processing related to issuing hunting license, managing different hunting tests for different types of weapons, game harvest reporting, police security checks, and license payments. The project demonstrates the breadth of the F2 COTS for government platform. Delivered as one fully integrated solution, F2 is able to support national registers, case processing, self-service and mass operations such as billing and payment collection. F2 for Partners The F2-for-Partners strategy is a core element of the long-term growth plan. By establishing an ecosystem of partners and customers who manage the consulting work related to implementing and servicing F2 solutions, cBrain can scale its business without revenue growth being directly constrained by the burden of organizational expansion. At the core of this strategy are the F2 Service Builder no-code configuration tools. The F2 Service Builder allows local partners and governments to independently design and build F2-based government solutions. Solutions are configured using a spreadsheet interface, enabling users without a technical background to create solutions. The configured solutions are stored as open source definitions in so-called process libraries. The combination of open source and process libraries makes it easy to reuse solutions simply by copying and adapting the process definition source code. The F2 Service Builder technology thus enables rapid development and reuse, helping governments accelerate digital transformation and scale solutions efficiently. Working with UNDP, aligning with the Digital offer for Africa strategy In November 2024, UNDP and cBrain signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, the partnership aims to accelerate digital transformation of governments and their citizens in the African region. During the spring, cBrain has initiated an F2 process library at UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi. Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars. When the partnership was announced, Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa Director, stated: “Digital is the lifeline to opportunity in Africa, and it should not remain a luxury. With the right partners like Denmark and cBrain, we can expand critical access to information and education, and unlock innovation at scale, thus bridging divides and empowering millions to shape a more equal and prosperous future in Africa”. In parallel, the Ambassador of Denmark in Nairobi, Stephan Schönemann, stated: “cBrain is a leading Danish software company, promoting digitalization as a driver for good governance. Their collaboration with UNDP can help drive the sustainable development and digital transformation across the African continent. This collaboration echoes the spirit of the Danish government’s new Africa strategy which places a strong emphasis on technology, public-private partnerships, democracy, and knowledge sharing”. First large scale project in Romania In December 2024, cBrain’s partner in Romania, Wing Leading Edge, has won a public tender to deliver a new national platform for administering citizen pensions. The solution is being delivered in the Romanian language, with cBrain operating as a sub-supplier. Using the F2 Service Builder and process libraries, F2 is now being configured as the case management and processing core, supporting close to 100 different administrative processes and integrating with multiple other systems. cBrain sees the Romanian pension project as a milestone both technically and strategically. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the F2 Service Builder and process library technology, and it highlights the early success of the F2-for-Partners strategy. F2 AI Assistant offers government AI on premise AI is emerging as a transformative technology for governments worldwide. For cBrain, AI is not a separate product but an integrated part of our strategy to deliver Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for government. We embed AI directly into the F2 platform, ensuring that it supports caseworkers and managers in their daily work, and due to our unique technology, the F2 Assistant runs on premise, thereby safeguarding the principles of security, transparency, and data sovereignty. We continue to develop the F2 AI Assistant, adding new capabilities during the first half new capability. Operating fully within the secure F2 environment, the AI Assistant can summarize documents, propose case-relevant actions, and support knowledge sharing across organizations, always under the control and without compromising sovereignty. We see AI not only as a driver of efficiency but also as a catalyst for redefining digital government operations, further strengthening F2 as a category-defining standard in the global COTS software for government industry. Shaping the future of government software Already into the last quarters of our 2023–2025 growth plan, we are very encouraged by the progress. With a strong product position and strong customers references, supported by a solid financial position, we see cBrain well-positioned for the decade ahead. We are confident that our strategy, built on taking leadership in COTS for government industry, will enable us to capture the opportunities of a fast-emerging market and secure long-term, sustainable growth.

Constant currency net sales decreased by 5.1% to 20.5 million euros (21.6). The operating environment remained challenging due to continued low consumer confidence. Despite that we managed to achieve very strong sales growth in the Rest of Europe through improving distribution, successful new product launches and effective in-store campaigns. In the Nordics, some customers have been cautious in their buying patterns due to the challenging market. In the first half of the year, net sales decreased by 3.5% and amounted to 41.5 million euros (43.0). During the period, credit risks continued in some of our customers, and as a precaution we restricted shipments especially in the first quarter, which had a negative sales impact on sales outside the Nordics. In the Nordics, the sales were affected by some key customers buying smaller campaign volumes compared to last year. Strikes also impacted us and the Finnish trade negatively during the first quarter. Compared to the Q2 in the previous year, Rest of Europe showed a strong growth of 22.1% to 5.1 million euros (4.2). Invoiced sales for the second quarter in the Nordics decreased by 7.6% to 15.9 million euros (17.2) The decline in the Nordics came from a few customers, relating to timing of campaigns and slower sell-out. Our extensive pipeline of new products is showing good performance, and we are happy to see strengthening customer partnerships and increased distribution in the Rest of Europe. Storage is the Group’s biggest product category, and it represents most of the business outside the Nordic countries. The positive sales development in the Rest of Europe supported the Storage category’s invoiced sales which increased by 1.0% to 13.5 million euros (13.4) compared to Q2 last year. Sales of the Kitchen category decreased by 8.0% to 4.4 million euros (4.7), the decrease comes from lower buying volumes in the Nordics. The main part of the Kitchen category sales is still coming from the Nordic countries. The Home & Garden category sales decreased by 3.8% to 3.3 million euros (3.5). Orthex’s Q2 profitability increased with the adjusted EBITA margin at 8.4% (7.4%) and the adjusted EBITA at 1.7 million euros (1.6) compared to the same period last year. We managed to keep our overall costs under good control, which enabled us to protect the profit margins despite the decline in sales in the Nordics. Cash flows in the quarter were according to our plans at -0.8 million euros (-0.4). The net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio (leverage) was down at a healthy 1.4 (1.6) at the end of the period. This positions us well to be prepared for possible strategic investments. Orthex conducted a sustainability materiality assessment with key stakeholders during the spring. The assessment results are used to ensure that our sustainability strategy focuses on material sustainability topics. In May 2025, Orthex joined UN Global Compact. The UN Global Compact is a United Nations initiative to encourage businesses worldwide to adopt sustainable and socially responsible practices. During the upcoming quarters, we will be updating our commercial strategy to strengthen our commercial offering and ensure efficient targeting of key channels, key customers and key markets, with a focus on becoming a truly European company. The ambition is to accelerate healthy growth, while ensuring that our operations are optimized to serve our key markets efficiently. I want to sincerely thank all our stakeholders, partners and our dedicated personnel for the good cooperation during times which require quite some extra efforts to overcome consumer carefulness under geopolitically turbulent conditions. ” Press conference on financial results: Orthex’s CEO Alexander Rosenlew, CFO Saara Mäkelä and CM S O Hanna Kukkonen will present the report today in a webcast starting at 11.00 a.m. EEST.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed consolidated financial statement, which has not been audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditor, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. It is our opinion that the interim condensed consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view of the financial position for the Group on 30 June 2025 and the results of the Group’s operations and cash flows for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. Further, in our opinion, the Management's review gives a fair view of the development in the Group's activities and financial matters, results of operations, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of material risks and uncertainties that the Group face.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements.

The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The development was impacted by unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, which will also affect Q3 to some extent, combined with timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA amounted to negative DKK 13 million compared to DKK 3 million in Q2 2024 due to lower gross profit and continued allocation of SG&A costs from delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025, gross profit was DKK 28 million for a margin of 9.7%, down from DKK 51 million and a margin of 26.4%. H1 2025 EBITDA was DKK negative 16 million compared to DKK 22 million last year. In Q2 2025, EBIT amounted to negative DKK 15 million compared to DKK 2 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to negative DKK 19 million, down from DKK 19 million in H1 2024. Wooden houses Sweden Q2 2025 revenue was DKK 37 million against DKK 27 million in Q2 2024 with an ASP of DKK 1.3 million against DKK 1.1 million last year. Deliveries were 29, up from 22 in the comparison period and 24 units were sold compared to 27 in Q2 2024. In H1 2025 revenue amounted to DKK 59 million, up from DKK 54 million. ASP was DKK 1.3 million compared to 1.3 million last year. 45 units were delivered, up from 39 last year. Sales came to 57, up from 39 in H1 2024. In July 2025, 3 houses were delivered, and 6 units were sold in Sweden. Supported by reversal of provisions for two completed projects Q2 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 18 million for a margin of 50.0% compared to DKK 10 million and a margin of 36.8% in Q2 2024. EBITDA was DKK 9 million against DKK 1 million last year, driven by improved gross profit and allocation of SG&A costs to Semi-detached for delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 29 million for a margin of 48.9% against DKK 18 million and a margin of 34.2%. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 12 million compared to DKK 0 last year. Q2 2025 EBIT came to DKK 7 million against negative DKK 1 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 8 million, up from negative DKK 4 million in H1 2024. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million).

DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1.

Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024.

Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed consolidated financial statement, which has not been audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditor, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. It is our opinion that the interim condensed consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view of the financial position for the Group on 30 June 2025 and the results of the Group’s operations and cash flows for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. Further, in our opinion, the Management's review gives a fair view of the development in the Group's activities and financial matters, results of operations, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of material risks and uncertainties that the Group face.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements.

The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The development was impacted by unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, which will also affect Q3 to some extent, combined with timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA amounted to negative DKK 13 million compared to DKK 3 million in Q2 2024 due to lower gross profit and continued allocation of SG&A costs from delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025, gross profit was DKK 28 million for a margin of 9.7%, down from DKK 51 million and a margin of 26.4%. H1 2025 EBITDA was DKK negative 16 million compared to DKK 22 million last year. In Q2 2025, EBIT amounted to negative DKK 15 million compared to DKK 2 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to negative DKK 19 million, down from DKK 19 million in H1 2024. Wooden houses Sweden Q2 2025 revenue was DKK 37 million against DKK 27 million in Q2 2024 with an ASP of DKK 1.3 million against DKK 1.1 million last year. Deliveries were 29, up from 22 in the comparison period and 24 units were sold compared to 27 in Q2 2024. In H1 2025 revenue amounted to DKK 59 million, up from DKK 54 million. ASP was DKK 1.3 million compared to 1.3 million last year. 45 units were delivered, up from 39 last year. Sales came to 57, up from 39 in H1 2024. In July 2025, 3 houses were delivered, and 6 units were sold in Sweden. Supported by reversal of provisions for two completed projects Q2 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 18 million for a margin of 50.0% compared to DKK 10 million and a margin of 36.8% in Q2 2024. EBITDA was DKK 9 million against DKK 1 million last year, driven by improved gross profit and allocation of SG&A costs to Semi-detached for delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 29 million for a margin of 48.9% against DKK 18 million and a margin of 34.2%. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 12 million compared to DKK 0 last year. Q2 2025 EBIT came to DKK 7 million against negative DKK 1 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 8 million, up from negative DKK 4 million in H1 2024. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million).

DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1.

Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024.

Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed consolidated financial statement, which has not been audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditor, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. It is our opinion that the interim condensed consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view of the financial position for the Group on 30 June 2025 and the results of the Group’s operations and cash flows for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. Further, in our opinion, the Management's review gives a fair view of the development in the Group's activities and financial matters, results of operations, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of material risks and uncertainties that the Group face.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements.

The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The development was impacted by unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, which will also affect Q3 to some extent, combined with timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA amounted to negative DKK 13 million compared to DKK 3 million in Q2 2024 due to lower gross profit and continued allocation of SG&A costs from delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025, gross profit was DKK 28 million for a margin of 9.7%, down from DKK 51 million and a margin of 26.4%. H1 2025 EBITDA was DKK negative 16 million compared to DKK 22 million last year. In Q2 2025, EBIT amounted to negative DKK 15 million compared to DKK 2 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to negative DKK 19 million, down from DKK 19 million in H1 2024. Wooden houses Sweden Q2 2025 revenue was DKK 37 million against DKK 27 million in Q2 2024 with an ASP of DKK 1.3 million against DKK 1.1 million last year. Deliveries were 29, up from 22 in the comparison period and 24 units were sold compared to 27 in Q2 2024. In H1 2025 revenue amounted to DKK 59 million, up from DKK 54 million. ASP was DKK 1.3 million compared to 1.3 million last year. 45 units were delivered, up from 39 last year. Sales came to 57, up from 39 in H1 2024. In July 2025, 3 houses were delivered, and 6 units were sold in Sweden. Supported by reversal of provisions for two completed projects Q2 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 18 million for a margin of 50.0% compared to DKK 10 million and a margin of 36.8% in Q2 2024. EBITDA was DKK 9 million against DKK 1 million last year, driven by improved gross profit and allocation of SG&A costs to Semi-detached for delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 29 million for a margin of 48.9% against DKK 18 million and a margin of 34.2%. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 12 million compared to DKK 0 last year. Q2 2025 EBIT came to DKK 7 million against negative DKK 1 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 8 million, up from negative DKK 4 million in H1 2024. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million).

DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1.

Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024.

Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed consolidated financial statement, which has not been audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditor, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. It is our opinion that the interim condensed consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view of the financial position for the Group on 30 June 2025 and the results of the Group’s operations and cash flows for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. Further, in our opinion, the Management's review gives a fair view of the development in the Group's activities and financial matters, results of operations, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of material risks and uncertainties that the Group face.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements.

The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The development was impacted by unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, which will also affect Q3 to some extent, combined with timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA amounted to negative DKK 13 million compared to DKK 3 million in Q2 2024 due to lower gross profit and continued allocation of SG&A costs from delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025, gross profit was DKK 28 million for a margin of 9.7%, down from DKK 51 million and a margin of 26.4%. H1 2025 EBITDA was DKK negative 16 million compared to DKK 22 million last year. In Q2 2025, EBIT amounted to negative DKK 15 million compared to DKK 2 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to negative DKK 19 million, down from DKK 19 million in H1 2024. Wooden houses Sweden Q2 2025 revenue was DKK 37 million against DKK 27 million in Q2 2024 with an ASP of DKK 1.3 million against DKK 1.1 million last year. Deliveries were 29, up from 22 in the comparison period and 24 units were sold compared to 27 in Q2 2024. In H1 2025 revenue amounted to DKK 59 million, up from DKK 54 million. ASP was DKK 1.3 million compared to 1.3 million last year. 45 units were delivered, up from 39 last year. Sales came to 57, up from 39 in H1 2024. In July 2025, 3 houses were delivered, and 6 units were sold in Sweden. Supported by reversal of provisions for two completed projects Q2 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 18 million for a margin of 50.0% compared to DKK 10 million and a margin of 36.8% in Q2 2024. EBITDA was DKK 9 million against DKK 1 million last year, driven by improved gross profit and allocation of SG&A costs to Semi-detached for delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 29 million for a margin of 48.9% against DKK 18 million and a margin of 34.2%. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 12 million compared to DKK 0 last year. Q2 2025 EBIT came to DKK 7 million against negative DKK 1 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 8 million, up from negative DKK 4 million in H1 2024. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million).

DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1.

Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024.

Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed consolidated financial statement, which has not been audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditor, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. It is our opinion that the interim condensed consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view of the financial position for the Group on 30 June 2025 and the results of the Group’s operations and cash flows for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. Further, in our opinion, the Management's review gives a fair view of the development in the Group's activities and financial matters, results of operations, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of material risks and uncertainties that the Group face.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements.

The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The development was impacted by unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, which will also affect Q3 to some extent, combined with timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA amounted to negative DKK 13 million compared to DKK 3 million in Q2 2024 due to lower gross profit and continued allocation of SG&A costs from delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025, gross profit was DKK 28 million for a margin of 9.7%, down from DKK 51 million and a margin of 26.4%. H1 2025 EBITDA was DKK negative 16 million compared to DKK 22 million last year. In Q2 2025, EBIT amounted to negative DKK 15 million compared to DKK 2 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to negative DKK 19 million, down from DKK 19 million in H1 2024. Wooden houses Sweden Q2 2025 revenue was DKK 37 million against DKK 27 million in Q2 2024 with an ASP of DKK 1.3 million against DKK 1.1 million last year. Deliveries were 29, up from 22 in the comparison period and 24 units were sold compared to 27 in Q2 2024. In H1 2025 revenue amounted to DKK 59 million, up from DKK 54 million. ASP was DKK 1.3 million compared to 1.3 million last year. 45 units were delivered, up from 39 last year. Sales came to 57, up from 39 in H1 2024. In July 2025, 3 houses were delivered, and 6 units were sold in Sweden. Supported by reversal of provisions for two completed projects Q2 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 18 million for a margin of 50.0% compared to DKK 10 million and a margin of 36.8% in Q2 2024. EBITDA was DKK 9 million against DKK 1 million last year, driven by improved gross profit and allocation of SG&A costs to Semi-detached for delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 29 million for a margin of 48.9% against DKK 18 million and a margin of 34.2%. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 12 million compared to DKK 0 last year. Q2 2025 EBIT came to DKK 7 million against negative DKK 1 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 8 million, up from negative DKK 4 million in H1 2024. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million).

DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1.

Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024.

Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed consolidated financial statement, which has not been audited or reviewed by the Company’s auditor, has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the EU, and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. It is our opinion that the interim condensed consolidated financial statement gives a true and fair view of the financial position for the Group on 30 June 2025 and the results of the Group’s operations and cash flows for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. Further, in our opinion, the Management's review gives a fair view of the development in the Group's activities and financial matters, results of operations, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of material risks and uncertainties that the Group face.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The development was impacted by unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, which will also affect Q3 to some extent, combined with timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA amounted to negative DKK 13 million compared to DKK 3 million in Q2 2024 due to lower gross profit and continued allocation of SG&A costs from delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025, gross profit was DKK 28 million for a margin of 9.7%, down from DKK 51 million and a margin of 26.4%. H1 2025 EBITDA was DKK negative 16 million compared to DKK 22 million last year. In Q2 2025, EBIT amounted to negative DKK 15 million compared to DKK 2 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to negative DKK 19 million, down from DKK 19 million in H1 2024. Wooden houses Sweden Q2 2025 revenue was DKK 37 million against DKK 27 million in Q2 2024 with an ASP of DKK 1.3 million against DKK 1.1 million last year. Deliveries were 29, up from 22 in the comparison period and 24 units were sold compared to 27 in Q2 2024. In H1 2025 revenue amounted to DKK 59 million, up from DKK 54 million. ASP was DKK 1.3 million compared to 1.3 million last year. 45 units were delivered, up from 39 last year. Sales came to 57, up from 39 in H1 2024. In July 2025, 3 houses were delivered, and 6 units were sold in Sweden. Supported by reversal of provisions for two completed projects Q2 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 18 million for a margin of 50.0% compared to DKK 10 million and a margin of 36.8% in Q2 2024. EBITDA was DKK 9 million against DKK 1 million last year, driven by improved gross profit and allocation of SG&A costs to Semi-detached for delivery of produced elements in Sweden. H1 2025 gross profit amounted to DKK 29 million for a margin of 48.9% against DKK 18 million and a margin of 34.2%. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 12 million compared to DKK 0 last year. Q2 2025 EBIT came to DKK 7 million against negative DKK 1 million last year. H1 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 8 million, up from negative DKK 4 million in H1 2024. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group. Forward-looking statements This interim report includes forward-looking statements on various matters, such as expected earnings and future strategies and expansion plans. Such statements are uncertain and involve various risks, as many factors, some of which are beyond our control, may result in actual developments differing considerably from the set expectations. Such factors include but are not limited to general economic and business conditions, exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, the demand for our services and competition in the market. Risk factors HusCompagniet is exposed to strategic, operational, and financial risks, which are described in the management review in the 2024 Annual Report. Statement by Management The Board of Directors and the Executive Board have reviewed and approved the interim condensed consolidated financial statement of the Group for the period 1 January – 30 June 2025.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110-130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT).

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Webcast and conference call HusCompagniet will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, 22 August 2025, at 10:00 (CEST).

Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

The positive revenue development follows consecutive quarters of increased sales. Group CEO of HusCompagniet, Martin Ravn-Nielsen says : “ We are pleased to see that market conditions for particularly the Detached segment continued to improve. Despite continued low consumer confidence, the sales pickup in this segment gained traction in H1 2025. At the same time, we signed both smaller and larger contracts in the Semi-detached segment and continued to expand our total order backlog. ” Gross margin [1] declined and came to 18.9% in H1 2025 against 21.9% in H1 2024. The development was due to lower contribution from Semi-detached, which was impacted by the effect of a few projects in HC Elements with unsatisfactory low margins, timing of project deliveries, lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for an EBITDA margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. In H1 2025, sales increased by 10% to 701 houses (units) and deliveries by 3% to 394 houses. Progress was driven by the Detached segment and supported by Wooden houses. At the same time, the total order backlog grew 40% to DKK 2,069 million due to satisfactory sales performance in all three segments. “Based on the significant growth of our order backlog and the continued sales traction, we have welcomed new employees in a balanced ramp-up of our organisation. We are strengthening our team to support increasing sales across the Detached and Semi-detached segments as well as our ability to seize future opportunities” , says Martin Ravn-Nielsen.

In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs and SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 are restated reflecting the change in presentation. Highlights In H1 2025, a total of 701 houses (units) were sold compared to 640 in H1 2024. The increase was mainly driven by the Detached segment with 431 units sold against 373 in H1 2024, as well as the Wooden houses segment where 57 units were sold, up from 39 units in H1 2024. Sales in the Semi-detached segment came out lower at 213 units compared to 228 in H1 2024 due to timing of building permits. Revenue increased by 29% to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025 driven by all segments, reflecting continued sales progress in recent quarters and higher activity in all three segments. Deliveries totalled 394 houses (units) in H1 2025 compared to 382 in the same period last year driven by the Detached segment, which was up by 18% compared to H1 2024. H1 2025 gross profit increased by 12% to DKK 260 million for a margin of 18.9% against a margin of 21.9% in H1 2024. While Detached and Wooden houses contributed positively to the improved gross profit, the contribution from Semi-detached was lower due to unsatisfactory margins on a few projects in HC Elements, timing of project deliveries, a lower ratio of projects on own land and a changed product mix. EBITDA came to DKK 39 million for a margin of 2.9% compared to DKK 49 million and a margin of 4.6% in H1 2024, due to the lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales. EBIT amounted to DKK 18 million in H1 2025, down from DKK 24 million last year. At end-Q2 2025, the order backlog (net) came to DKK 2,069 million, an 40% increase from end-Q2 2024. 30 June 2025, net debt amounted to DKK 304 million for a leverage ratio (NIBD/LTM EBITDA) of 3.2x, up from net debt of DKK 236 million and a leverage ratio of 2.4x at end-Q2 2024 driven by changes in working capital and the decline in EBITDA. Free cash flow in H1 2025 amounted to DKK -26 million compared to DKK 130 million in H1 2024 due to the higher activity level and phasing of deliveries impacting net working capital. Outlook for 2025 Based on the H1 2025 financial performance and expectations for the remainder of 2025, the guidance issued on 7 March 2025 is narrowed: Revenue is expected to be DKK 2.9-3.1 billion (previously DKK 2.8-3.1 billion ) EBITDA is expected to be DKK 110 -130 million (previously DKK 110 - 160 million ) Operating profit (EBIT) is expected to be DKK 70-90 million (previously DKK 70 - 120 million ) Assumptions for the outlook Current expectations for 2025 deliveries are between 1,000 and 1,100 houses (previously between 1,000 and 1,200 houses). The 2025 guidance is based on expectations of a continued market rebound and assumes no severe disruption of supply chains or raw material prices significantly exceeding current levels. Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA.

Use of alternative performance measures: Throughout the report HusCompagniet present financial measures which are not defined according to IFRS. Additional information is included in note 6.7. in the Annual Report 2024. Business Update While global political and macroeconomic turmoil impacted overall consumer confidence in the first half of 2025, conditions in the Danish housebuilding market have been relatively stable with a continued pickup in sales. This development was supported by strong performance of the economy in Denmark based on an unchanged high employment rate, steady core inflation and positive views on interest rate trends. In the first six months of 2025, HusCompagniet sold 701 units compared to 640 in H1 2024, and delivered 394 units, up from 382 in the comparison period. The Detached market in Denmark continued the gradual recovery, reflected in a satisfactory number of customer leads and meeting activity throughout the period. This formed the basis for continuously improved sales in the quarter and the half-year. To further strengthen local presence in Jutland, a new show room will open in Horsens together with a dedicated FORMIUM office in Aarhus, both expected in Q4. In the first half of 2025, HusCompagniet’s Semi-detached business sold a total of 213 units. During the period, the business unit signed two large conditional contracts on projects on Bornholm comprised of 96 units and in Ringsted comprised of 191 units of which 83 units were included in sales and the order backlog in June. After the balance sheet date, a subcontracting agreement was signed with Einar Kornerup A/S for construction of 156 detached housing units in the existing Søgården residential area located in Bagsværd. Overall, the activity level remained satisfactory, and constructive dialogues with larger investors continued. Market conditions in Sweden remain stable, and the Swedish factory continued to deliver to the Semi-detached segment in Denmark to accommodate timely execution on the project order backlog. Revenue came to DKK 1,375 million in H1 2025, of which the Detached segment accounted for 75%, while Semi-detached and Wooden houses accounted for 21% and 4%, respectively. Customer satisfaction HusCompagniet maintained its position as the best rated housing construction company among Danish customers on Trustpilot with a satisfaction score of 4.8 out of 5.0 based on more than 7,100 reviews. The strong performance was maintained in a period where the Danish housebuilding industry and HusCompagniet were subject to critical media coverage related to issues with crumbling mortar joints in detached houses constructed during 2017-2022, among other things. Customer satisfaction and loyalty remain high, and HusCompagniet has received a limited number of customer enquiries following the media coverage and entered constructive dialogues to assess and accommodate cases where relevant. Financial review Revenue Q2 2025 was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year growth. Revenue increased in Q2 2025 to DKK 740 million, up 28% from DKK 579 million in Q2 2024. The development was driven by higher sales in the Detached and Semi-detached segments in recent quarters. Deliveries totalled 199 units, down from 215 in Q2 2024 due to timing in the Semi-detached segment. H1 2025 revenue came to DKK 1,375 million against DKK 1,062 million in H1 2024. 394 housing units were delivered in the period, up from 382. Gross margin Q2 2025 gross profit increased by 14% to DKK 136 million for a margin of 18.4% in Q2 2025, down from a margin of 20.7% in the same period last year. This was largely attributable to Semi-detached, reflecting the effect of unsatisfactory low margins on a few HC Elements projects, timing of project deliveries and a lower ratio of projects on own land. H1 2025 gross margin was 18.9% against 21.9% in H1 2024. EBITDA Q2 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 23 million for a margin of 3.1% compared to DKK 27 million and a margin of 4.7% in Q2 2024, reflecting a lower contribution from Semi-detached, higher SG&A expenses and onboarding of new employees to support increasing sales, entailing higher staff costs. H1 2025 EBITDA came to DKK 39 million against DKK 49 million in the comparison period. Amortisation and depreciation In Q2 2025, amortisation and depreciation came to DKK 11 million, down from DKK 12 million in Q2 2024. In H1 2025, the amount came to DKK 21 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Amortisation mainly consists of development projects, whereas depreciation primarily refers to leasing contracts, factory equipment and IT projects. EBIT Q2 2025 EBIT amounted to DKK 12 million against DKK 15 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 EBIT came to DKK 18 million against DKK 24 million in H1 2024. Net financials Q2 2025 net financials were an expense of DKK 9 million, down from an expense of DKK 10 million in the same period last year. H1 2025 net financials came to an expense of DKK 15 million, down from an expense of DKK 20 million in H1 2024. Both Q2 2025 and H1 2025 financials include an expense of DKK 1.5 million related to the tax case, see note 7. Group profit for the period before tax For both Q2 and H1 2025, profit came to DKK 8 million, up from DKK 7 million in the comparison periods. Taxation For both Q2 and H1 2025 tax came to DKK 5 million compared to DKK 2 million in the comparison periods. The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling on the tax case in line with the company’s expectations, refer to Note 7. Cash flow Operating activities In Q2 2025, operating activities generated a cash outflow of DKK 5 million, down from an inflow of DKK 135 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital reflecting the higher activity level where sales have been outpacing deliveries across all three segments. Net contract assets are impacted by timing of deliveries in Detached and Semi-Detached has increased contract assets due to increased sales. Operating activities generated an outflow of DKK 15 million in H1 2025 against an inflow of DKK 134 million in the same period last year, driven by changes in working capital. Investing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to investing activities amounted to DKK 6 million of which DKK 4 million related to investment in property, plant and equipment. In the comparison period cash outflow came to DKK 3 million. H1 2025 cash outflow was DKK 11 million against an outflow of DKK 4 million in the same period last year. Financing activities Q2 2025 cash outflow to financing activities was DKK 6 million compared to an outflow of DKK 11 million in Q2 2024. H1 2025 cash outflow amounted to DKK 12 million against an outflow of DKK 17 million in the comparison period, which included acquisition of own shares for DKK 6 million. Free cash flow Q2 2025 free cash flow amounted to negative DKK 12 million against DKK 133 million in Q2 2024 due to the higher activity level impacting net working capital. H1 2025 free cash flow was negative DKK 26 million compared to DKK 130 million in the comparison period. Balance sheet Financing At 30 June 2025, net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 304 million, up from DKK 236 million at 30 June 2024, impacted by higher working capital. The financial leverage was 3.2x LTM EBITDA compared to 2.6x at year-end 2024. Equity H1 2025 equity came to DKK 2,111 million, up from DKK 2,093 million in H1 2024, primarily driven by a positive effect of foreign currency translation differences. Net working capital At 30 June 2025, net working capital came to DKK 314 million against DKK 200 million end-June 2024. The development was driven by a higher activity level and an increase in inventories as sales outpaced deliveries in a period characterised by continued momentum. Contract assets Net contract assets amounted to DKK 457 million at end-H1 2025 compared to DKK 264 million end-H1 2024 due to higher sales compared to deliveries. Dividend Dividend distribution to shareholders is suspended and is not expected to be reintroduced before leverage is below the long-term target of 2x net debt to EBITDA. Segments In H1 2025, the Detached segment comprised 75% of total revenue, whereas Semi-detached and Wooden houses generated 21% and 4%, respectively. H1 2024 revenue split was 77%, 18% and 5%, respectively.

General assumptions General assumptions comprise assumptions relating to macro-economic conditions, industry considerations, regulatory changes, and customer behaviour. The Group’s estimates assume that there will not be any material change in the competitive or regulatory landscape, and no other external actions significantly impacting the Group.

information This interim condensed financial report comprises the period 1 January – 30 June 2025. The interim condensed financial report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for interim financial reporting of listed companies. The accounting policies are consistent with those applied in the 2024 Annual Report except for the change in presenta-tion described below. Reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report for a full description of accounting policies applied. Change in presentation As of 2025, the Group has changed the presentation of staff costs related to production employees in the consolidated income statement. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Starting from 2025, staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden are presented as part of cost of sales impacting gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. The change aligns with the presentation of staff cost included in the cost of externally produced goods and services which is relevant to the reader. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation. Net profit and earnings per share are not impacted by the change in presentation. Adoption of new and revised IFRSs All new or revised and amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and interpretations (IFRIC) issued by IASB and endorsed by the EU effective for the financial year 2025 are adopted. The Group has assessed that the new or revised standards and interpretations have not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 2 Accounting estimates and judgements In preparing the interim condensed financial statements, management made various judgements, estimates and assumptions concerning present and future events that affected the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The significant estimates made by Management applying the Group’s accounting policies and the associated significant estimating uncertainties are the same for the preparation of the interim condensed financial statements as for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for 2024. 3 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into business units based on its products and services as well as geographical location. The Group has three reportable segments, as follows: - The Detached houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on site and plots - The Semi-detached and wood-frame houses in Denmark segment, which comprises brick houses built on sites and plots, including both business-to-business and business-to-consumers. - The Wooden houses in Sweden segment, which comprises detached prefabricated houses Executive Management is responsible for operating results of its business units for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit (EBIT). The Group's financing (including financial income and financial expenses) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Assets and liabilities are not allocated to segments. The segmentation reflects the internal reporting and management structure.

Non-contracted sales are recognised on delivery (point-in-time) whereas contracted sales are recognised over time. Payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project in the Detached segment; however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract in Detached and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit, during the project. 4 Revenue, continued The majority of the contracted sales in the semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. Contracted sales comprise the sale of houses constructed on the customer’s land, or houses sold on own land (semi-detached includes land plots) that are covered by a customer contract before construction is started. All contracted sales are fixed price contracts. Conversely, non-contracted sales comprise of: 1. The sale of houses constructed on own land to which no customer contract has been entered into before construction starts. 2. The sale of detached land-plots to which no customer contract has been entered into before purchase and development of the land plots. 5 Inventories DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Raw materials 29,060 21,991 26,618 Show houses and semi-detached houses 150,217 149,511 117,134 Land 117,517 102,804 91,323 Write-down inventories -735 -735 -735 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 Contracted sales awaiting transfer of control 2,609 19,283 11,715 Unsold inventories 293,450 254,288 222,625 Total inventories 296,059 273,571 234,340 6 Contract assets DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Selling price of contract assets 851,195 495,851 510,657 Invoicing on account -394,252 -232,027 -185,272 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Calculated as follows: Contract assets 739,535 463,548 471,735 Contract liabilities -282,592 -199,724 -146,350 Net contract assets 456,943 263,824 325,385 Prepayments from customers regarding construction contracts not yet started 0 720 0 DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Delivery obligations Within one year 1,564,563 1,332,043 1,554,570 After one year 504,860 141,328 341,240 Order backlog at period end 2,069,423 1,473,371 1,895,810 Construction contracts (assets/liabilities) Contract assets comprise the selling price of work performed on customers’ land but where the Group does not yet have an unconditional right to payment as the work performed has not yet been finalised or approved by the customer. Included is also the selling price of work performed on own land where a building permit has been issued and the Group does have an unconditional right to payment for work performed. Contract liabilities comprise agreed, unconditional payments received on account for work yet to be performed. For contracts entered into in the Detached segment, payment is typically due at the time of final delivery of the house project, however a small deposit is paid upon contract negotiation. The Group receives a bank guarantee in connection with the start-up of each contract and is entitled to payment for work performed, including profit during the project. For contracts entered into in the Semi-detached segment, payments on account are normally linked to the percentage of completion. Credit risk on contract assets is generally managed by regular credit rating of customers. Furthermore, bank deposits or bank guarantees are usually obtained before the house is built. The credit risk exposure relating to dealing with private counterparties is estimated to be limited. For projects in the Semi-detached business, the credit risk is managed by credit rating analysis and the majority of the contracted sales in Semi-detached segment entitle the Group to on-account payments linked to the percentage of completion. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities DKK’000 H1 2025 H1 2024 2024 Guarantee provision at 1 January 73,294 55,352 55,352 Arising during the year 20,851 17,446 50,898 Utilised -15,851 -17,183 -32,956 Guarantee provision at end of period 78,294 55,615 73,294 Distributed in the balance as follows: Non-current liabilities 48,957 27,421 38,407 Current liabilities 29,337 28,194 34,887 At 30 June 2025, the guarantee provision amounted to DKK 78 million (30 June 2024: DKK 56 million). Provisions for future costs of guarantee commitments at one and five-year reviews of houses delivered are recognised at amounts expected at the balance sheet date to be required to settle the commitment. As security for the borrowings and other liabilities, part of the assets of HC Production A/S has been pledged. The book value of the mortgaged assets amounts to DKK 67 million. It can be split in the following way: As security for mortgage of DKK 9 million there is a mortgage of nom. DKK 40 million in land and buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. Additional commitments: • Owner’s mortgage of nom. DKK 5 million in buildings with a book value of DKK 25 million. • Company charge of nom. DKK 9 million on the assets of the parent company with a book value of DKK 40 million. In HusCompagniet B2B A/S an owner's mortgage deed of nom. DKK 20 million in buildings, with a booked value of DKK 20 million has been pledged. This estimate is based on calculations, assessments by Company Management and experience gained from past transactions. Contingent assets and liabilities The Group is, from time to time, involved in disputes arising out of the normal conduct of its business. In 2021, the Group opened an arbitration against a third party regarding a still ongoing dispute, reflected in the provisions. The Group expects a positive outcome of the arbitration. Referring to note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024, the Group has an uncertain tax position relating to tax years 2019-2020 . In July 2025, The Danish Tax Authorities passed a ruling concerning the reversal of deduction of marketing contributions provided to HusCompagniet’s foreign subsidiaries for the period 2019-2020 as described in the Annual Report 2024, note 6.1. The ruling is in line with the company’s expectations, and its effect was reflected and recognised in the 2024 consolidated financial statements. As of 30 June 2025, an additional interest expense of DKK 1.5 million has been recognised. HusCompagniet is considering further legal action and has therefore applied for deferral of payment. Following a positive dialogue, the Danish Tax Authorities have revoked the initial decision to deny reopening and correction of the taxable income statement for 2020, which could potentially have entailed additional tax and interest expenses of DKK 25 million in total, cf. note 6.1 in the Annual Report 2024. This potential outcome has thus been avoided. 7 Guarantee commitments and contingent liabilities , continued Collateral DKK 12 million of cash and short-term deposits is held in restricted accounts and released when the completed houses are delivered to the customers (30 June 2024: DKK 14 million). Restricted accounts are classified as other receivables. Guarantees to trade creditors The Company had issued guarantees to trade creditors of DKK 72 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 81 million). Contractual obligations The Group has no material obligations not already recognized as liabilities in the financial statements. The loan agreement between Nordea, Danske Bank and HusCompagniet A/S includes a negative pledge. 8 Borrowings DKK’000 Maturity Fixed or floating interest Carrying amount 30 June 2025 Bank loan 2027 Floating 498,088 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,347 Borrowings at 30 June 2025 506,435 30 June 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,413 Mortgage 2032 Floating 9,276 Borrowings at 30 June 2024 506,689 31 December 2024 Bank loan 2027 Floating 497,750 Mortgage 2032 Floating 8,820 Borrowings at 31 December 2024 506,570 The bank loan, classified as a non-current liability, arises from a loan agreement where settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants. The permitted maximum leverage ratio - net interest-bearing debt divided by last twelve months adjusted EBITDA - must not exceed 3.5x. At 30 June 2025, the leverage ratio was 3.2x (30 June 2024: 2.4x). The presented amounts to be repaid do not include directly related costs arising from the issuing or extension of the loans of DKK 500 million, which are amortized over the term of the loans. These directly related costs were DKK 1.9 million at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024: DKK 2.5 million). 9 Impairment For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the three CGUs (“Detached”, “Semi-detached” and “Wooden houses”), which are also the operating and reportable segments. Among other factors, the Group considers the relationship between its market capitalization and the carrying value of assets including goodwill, when assessing for indicators of impairment. Impairment tests are performed separately for all three CGUs once a year or more frequently if indication of impairment exists. On H1 2025, Management has revisited the key assumptions used for the impairment test performed at 31.12.2024 for all three CGUs and concluded that there is no indication for impairment. Key assumptions The recoverable amount determined in the impairment test is based on a value-in-use calculation. To determine the value-in-use, Management is required to estimate the present value of the future free net cash flows based on budgets and strategy for the coming five years (the budget period) as well as projections for the terminal period after the budget period. A five-year period is used to reflect a full business cycle. Assumptions used in the estimate of the present value include the discount rate, revenue growth (estimated on basis of expected units to be delivered and expected unit price) and EBIT margin. Other assumptions include expected required investments, market share and growth expectations in the terminal period. For further description of conclusion from the last performed impairment testing and key assumptions a reference is made to the 2024 Annual Report, Note 4.3 Impairment testing. 10 Events after the balance sheet date No material events occurred between 30 June 2025 and the date of publication of this interim report that has not already been included in the interim report and that would have a material effect on the assessment of the Group’s financial position. [1] Staff costs related to production employees at the factories in Esbjerg and Sweden were reclassified in Q1 2025 as part of cost of sales and impact gross profit in the Semi-detached and Wooden houses segments. In prior years, the costs were included in staff costs as SG&A. Key figures from the comparison periods in 2024 have been restated reflecting the change in presentation.

We are the first defence and security industry company on the First North Growth Market marketplaces in Stockholm and Helsinki. The directed share issue arranged for the share exchange significantly strengthened the company's equity, and our financial position is strong. The amount of investments raised in connection with the corporate transactions was EUR 28.15 million. At the end of June, the company was net debt-free, and our equity ratio was 63.4%. Investments in new production facilities In line with our strategy, we have been able to quickly support the operations of our subsidiaries and secure financing and working capital for product development, internationalization and next-stage corporate transactions. After the merger, our subsidiary Uudenkaupungin Työvene acquired the property of Olkiluoto shipyard to increase its production capacity, and Lightspace Technologies announced an investment in its production facility in Ventspils, Latvia, to improve its cleanroom production capacity. In addition, our subsidiaries have several ongoing product development projects. The new production facilities of the Summa Drones business have been put into operation in Southern Finland, and the first test batch is being manufactured with our Ukrainian partner. We expect the first production batches to be completed and deliveries to begin during the second half of the year. Pro forma net sales increased by 35 per cent Several of our subsidiaries have already increased their net sales significantly compared to the previous year. In January–June 2025, our pro forma net sales were EUR 42.1 million, compared to EUR 31.1 million a year earlier. The net sales of our companies increased by more than 35 per cent in the first half of the year. Net sales in Summa Defence's continuing operations focusing on defence and security were EUR 34.9 (25.3) million and in the Renewable Energy business EUR 7.2 (5.8) million. Profitability improved During the first half of the year, our profitability also started to improve clearly, although the delay in the transaction slowed down the growth of the business volume of our subsidiaries. The profitability of our continuing operations was already slightly positive in the first half of the year, but Group administration expenses (EUR -1.9 million) and the result of the Renewable Energy business (EUR -1.9 million) pushed the pro forma adjusted operating profit to EUR -3.7 (-5.2) million. In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year. Summa Defence Plc Summa Defence Plc is a Finnish defence and security technology group that brings together security companies and together secures resources for product development and growth in a globally growing and developing sector. The company focuses on dual-use technology, i.e. developing and producing products for the defence, security and civilian sectors. Summa Defence Plc was born on 9 June 2025 following the merger of Summa Defence Oy and Meriaura Group Plc. The company’s share is listed on the Nasdaq First North Growth Market Finland and Sweden marketplaces. As part of the transaction, Meriaura Group Plc sold the shares of the marine logistics company Meriaura Oy to Meriaura Invest Oy.

This was driven by continued growth in Endoscopy Solutions, which grew 15.9%, and solid performance in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, which grew 6.4%. This brings the organic growth for the first nine months to 14.3% and the EBIT margin to 13.9%. The financial guidance for organic revenue growth for 2024/25 is updated to reflect the continued solid growth and is now expected to be 12-14% (previously 11-14%). “I am pleased with the continued solid growth momentum in our third quarter. With 15.9% growth in Endoscopy Solutions and portfolio expansions in pulmonology and urology, we are deepening our presence in high-growth markets. On the back of solid revenue performance in Endoscopy Solutions and strong growth in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, we are raising the lower end of our organic revenue guidance to 12-14% for the full year. We maintain our EBIT margin guidance, supported by solid organic growth and operational leverage, even as we navigate FX and tariff-related dynamics. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and execution, which makes this continued progress possible. We look forward to welcoming institutional investors, analysts, and financial media to attend our Capital Markets Day on 1 October 2025, where we will share insights on strategy and market opportunities.” BRITT MEELBY JENSEN Chief Executive Officer Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Business highlights Advancing pulmonology market leadership position with the expansion of Ambu® SureSight™ Connect video laryngoscopy solution for pediatric patients. Strengthened urology offering with FDA clearance for Ambu® aScope™ 5 Cysto HD cysto-nephroscope for PCNL procedures. Continued sustainability leadership with launch of first-of-its-kind endoscope tack-back and recycling program, the Ambu® Recircle Program, in key markets. Scott Heinzelman appointed new President for North America and member of Ambu’s Executive Leadership Team, as of 25 August. Financial highlights Revenue increased organically by 12.0% (15.0%) to DKK 1,507m (DKK 1,383m), with reported growth of 9.0% (15.7%). Organic growth for the first nine months was 14.3% (14.9%), with reported growth of 14.2% (12.9%). Endoscopy Solutions increased organically by 15.9% (18.0%). The Pulmonology business group posted 11.2% (9.9%) organic growth, positively impacted by continued aScope™ 5 Broncho adoption, as well as the newly launched video laryngoscopy solution. The Urology, ENT, & GI business group posted 20.8% (27.6%) organic growth, mainly driven by the aScope™ 4 portfolio, with sustained strong growth momentum for aScope™ 5 Uretero. Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring increased organically by 6.4% (10.9%) and by 11.1% (6.4%) for the first nine months, driven by both volume and price increases. EBIT before special items (b.s.i.) was DKK 170m (DKK 178m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 11.3% (12.9%). EBIT b.s.i. for the first nine months ended at DKK 637m (DKK 498m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 13.9% (12.4%). EBIT margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs but positively impacted by continued operational leverage from solid organic growth. Free cash flow (FCF) before acquisitions totaled DKK 128m (DKK 163m), leaving FCF for the first nine months to DKK 277m. This was impacted by continued higher net working capital to mitigate the global geopolitical uncertainties and support growth, and profitability was impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs. As a result, FCF assumptions for FY 2024/25 are now DKK ~400m (previously DKK +500m). Raise of lower end of organic revenue guidance to 12-14% (previously 11-14%), driven by continued procedure growth and conversion towards single-use solutions. EBIT margin b.s.i. guidance is maintained, with investments continuing as planned to support long-term growth, despite FX headwind and increased tariff costs. 2024/25 financial guidance: Organic revenue growth : 12-14% (previously 11-14%) EBIT margin b.s.i. : 13-15% Q3 2024/25 conference call A conference call is broadcast live today, 22 August 2025 at 11:00 (CEST), via ambu.com/webcastQ32025 .

Revenue for the first half increased by 33% to DKK 2,998 million, reflecting a strong performance in both Travel Health and Public Preparedness. Travel Health revenue increased by 24% to DKK 1,386 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by increased demand for rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines. Public Preparedness revenue increased by 51% to DKK 1,546 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by quarterly phasing of orders. Other revenue was DKK 66 million. EBITDA was DKK 961 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 32%. Based on a strong performance in the Travel Health business as well as further clarity on the Public Preparedness business for the remainder of the year, Bavarian Nordic has refined its financial guidance for 2025, which overall remains within the previously announced revenue and EBITDA margin intervals. Full year revenue expectations are narrowed to DKK 6,000-6,600 million, reflecting an upgrade of Travel Health to DKK 2,750 million, which still includes DKK 50-100 million from sale of Vimkunya, and narrowing the Public Preparedness interval to DKK 3,100-3,700 million, with the low end of the interval now secured by contracts. EBITDA margin before special items guidance remains unchanged at 26-30%. When including the net income of DKK 810 million from the recent sale of the Priority Review Voucher, the total EBITDA margin is expected to be 40-42%. DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 2025 Guidance Revenue 1,652 1,427 2,998 2,259 6,000 – 6,600 EBITDA margin before special items 1 33% 29% 32% 20% 26-30% 1 Other operating income of DKK 810 million from the sale of the Priority Review Voucher will be recognized in Q3 2025, contributing to an expected total EBITDA margin of 40-42% for the full year. Paul Chaplin, President & Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic said: “We are pleased to report a strong first half of 2025, which fully captures our successful commercial transformation over the past years, in line with our growth strategy. Our Travel Health business continues to outperform, delivering 24% revenue growth year-over-year, primarily driven by rabies and TBE vaccines. A major highlight for the period was the launch of our chikungunya vaccine for travelers, which is being introduced in more countries as we continue to expand our commercial footprint across new geographies. With the strong performance combined with recent additional orders for our mpox/smallpox vaccine, we refine our full year guidance to reflect higher revenue from Travel Health and a narrower revenue interval for the Public Preparedness business as we have now secured the lower end of our guidance for this business. Overall, we remain within our guided revenue interval and maintain our expectations to an EBITDA margin before special items of 26-30% in 2025. The recent sale of our Priority Review Voucher has generated a one-off income, strengthening our financial position and contributing to an improved result. Hence, the EBITDA margin including special items is expected to be 40-42% for the full year.” Highlights from the period Travel Health Vimkunya was approved in the US, EU and in the UK for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in individuals 12 years and older. The vaccine was launched commercially in the US in March, in Germany in May, and in France in June. Concurrently with the US approval of Vimkunya, Bavarian Nordic was granted a Priority Review Voucher, which was sold for USD 160 million. Upon completion of the sale in July, the Company earned net proceeds of DKK 810 million. Following the approval of Vimkunya in the US in February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Vimkunya for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus for US persons aged 12 and older traveling to regions with an outbreak or elevated risk of chikungunya, as well as for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to chikungunya virus. Recommendations on the use of the vaccine have since been issued by relevant authorities in France, Germany and in the UK. In June, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Vimkunya in children 2 to 11 years of age was initiated, seeking to expand the target population for the chikungunya vaccine. Public Preparedness The freeze-dried version of JYNNEOS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March for prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older. The approval supports the ongoing contract with the US government for stockpiling of the vaccine. In May, the US government exercised additional options valued at USD 143.6 million under the contract, with the majority planned for delivery in 2026. In June, investigator-sponsored clinical trials were initiated to support approval of the mpox/smallpox vaccine in vulnerable populations: infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Events after the reporting date In July, Bavarian Nordic entered a contract valued at over DKK 200 million for the supply of smallpox/mpox vaccines to a European country. Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured approximately DKK 3,100 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this business. In July, Health Canada accepted for review the Company’s application for licensure of the chikungunya vaccine, potentially supporting approval in the first half of 2026. In July, the sale of the Priority Review Voucher was completed, generating net proceeds of DKK 810 million. In July, Bavarian Nordic announced that it had entered into an announcement agreement with Innosera ApS, a newly formed company controlled by Nordic Capital Fund XI1 and funds managed and advised by Permira Beteiligungsberatung GmbH, pursuant to which Innosera ApS will make an all-cash recommended voluntary public takeover offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Bavarian Nordic. Innosera ApS is expected to publish its offer document on August 26, 2025, at the latest.

Revenue for the first half increased by 33% to DKK 2,998 million, reflecting a strong performance in both Travel Health and Public Preparedness. Travel Health revenue increased by 24% to DKK 1,386 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by increased demand for rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines. Public Preparedness revenue increased by 51% to DKK 1,546 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by quarterly phasing of orders. Other revenue was DKK 66 million. EBITDA was DKK 961 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 32%. Based on a strong performance in the Travel Health business as well as further clarity on the Public Preparedness business for the remainder of the year, Bavarian Nordic has refined its financial guidance for 2025, which overall remains within the previously announced revenue and EBITDA margin intervals. Full year revenue expectations are narrowed to DKK 6,000-6,600 million, reflecting an upgrade of Travel Health to DKK 2,750 million, which still includes DKK 50-100 million from sale of Vimkunya, and narrowing the Public Preparedness interval to DKK 3,100-3,700 million, with the low end of the interval now secured by contracts. EBITDA margin before special items guidance remains unchanged at 26-30%. When including the net income of DKK 810 million from the recent sale of the Priority Review Voucher, the total EBITDA margin is expected to be 40-42%. DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 2025 Guidance Revenue 1,652 1,427 2,998 2,259 6,000 – 6,600 EBITDA margin before special items 1 33% 29% 32% 20% 26-30% 1 Other operating income of DKK 810 million from the sale of the Priority Review Voucher will be recognized in Q3 2025, contributing to an expected total EBITDA margin of 40-42% for the full year. Paul Chaplin, President & Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic said: “We are pleased to report a strong first half of 2025, which fully captures our successful commercial transformation over the past years, in line with our growth strategy. Our Travel Health business continues to outperform, delivering 24% revenue growth year-over-year, primarily driven by rabies and TBE vaccines. A major highlight for the period was the launch of our chikungunya vaccine for travelers, which is being introduced in more countries as we continue to expand our commercial footprint across new geographies. With the strong performance combined with recent additional orders for our mpox/smallpox vaccine, we refine our full year guidance to reflect higher revenue from Travel Health and a narrower revenue interval for the Public Preparedness business as we have now secured the lower end of our guidance for this business. Overall, we remain within our guided revenue interval and maintain our expectations to an EBITDA margin before special items of 26-30% in 2025. The recent sale of our Priority Review Voucher has generated a one-off income, strengthening our financial position and contributing to an improved result. Hence, the EBITDA margin including special items is expected to be 40-42% for the full year.” Highlights from the period Travel Health Vimkunya was approved in the US, EU and in the UK for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in individuals 12 years and older. The vaccine was launched commercially in the US in March, in Germany in May, and in France in June. Concurrently with the US approval of Vimkunya, Bavarian Nordic was granted a Priority Review Voucher, which was sold for USD 160 million. Upon completion of the sale in July, the Company earned net proceeds of DKK 810 million. Following the approval of Vimkunya in the US in February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Vimkunya for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus for US persons aged 12 and older traveling to regions with an outbreak or elevated risk of chikungunya, as well as for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to chikungunya virus. Recommendations on the use of the vaccine have since been issued by relevant authorities in France, Germany and in the UK. In June, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Vimkunya in children 2 to 11 years of age was initiated, seeking to expand the target population for the chikungunya vaccine. Public Preparedness The freeze-dried version of JYNNEOS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March for prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older. The approval supports the ongoing contract with the US government for stockpiling of the vaccine. In May, the US government exercised additional options valued at USD 143.6 million under the contract, with the majority planned for delivery in 2026. In June, investigator-sponsored clinical trials were initiated to support approval of the mpox/smallpox vaccine in vulnerable populations: infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Events after the reporting date In July, Bavarian Nordic entered a contract valued at over DKK 200 million for the supply of smallpox/mpox vaccines to a European country. Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured approximately DKK 3,100 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this business. In July, Health Canada accepted for review the Company’s application for licensure of the chikungunya vaccine, potentially supporting approval in the first half of 2026. In July, the sale of the Priority Review Voucher was completed, generating net proceeds of DKK 810 million. In July, Bavarian Nordic announced that it had entered into an announcement agreement with Innosera ApS, a newly formed company controlled by Nordic Capital Fund XI1 and funds managed and advised by Permira Beteiligungsberatung GmbH, pursuant to which Innosera ApS will make an all-cash recommended voluntary public takeover offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Bavarian Nordic. Innosera ApS is expected to publish its offer document on August 26, 2025, at the latest.

Following the approval of Vimkunya in the US in February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Vimkunya for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus for US persons aged 12 and older traveling to regions with an outbreak or elevated risk of chikungunya, as well as for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to chikungunya virus. Recommendations on the use of the vaccine have since been issued by relevant authorities in France, Germany and in the UK. In June, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Vimkunya in children 2 to 11 years of age was initiated, seeking to expand the target population for the chikungunya vaccine. Public Preparedness The freeze-dried version of JYNNEOS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March for prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older. The approval supports the ongoing contract with the US government for stockpiling of the vaccine. In May, the US government exercised additional options valued at USD 143.6 million under the contract, with the majority planned for delivery in 2026. In June, investigator-sponsored clinical trials were initiated to support approval of the mpox/smallpox vaccine in vulnerable populations: infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Events after the reporting date In July, Bavarian Nordic entered a contract valued at over DKK 200 million for the supply of smallpox/mpox vaccines to a European country. Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured approximately DKK 3,100 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this business. In July, Health Canada accepted for review the Company’s application for licensure of the chikungunya vaccine, potentially supporting approval in the first half of 2026. In July, the sale of the Priority Review Voucher was completed, generating net proceeds of DKK 810 million. In July, Bavarian Nordic announced that it had entered into an announcement agreement with Innosera ApS, a newly formed company controlled by Nordic Capital Fund XI1 and funds managed and advised by Permira Beteiligungsberatung GmbH, pursuant to which Innosera ApS will make an all-cash recommended voluntary public takeover offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Bavarian Nordic. Innosera ApS is expected to publish its offer document on August 26, 2025, at the latest.

Revenue for the first half increased by 33% to DKK 2,998 million, reflecting a strong performance in both Travel Health and Public Preparedness. Travel Health revenue increased by 24% to DKK 1,386 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by increased demand for rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines. Public Preparedness revenue increased by 51% to DKK 1,546 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by quarterly phasing of orders. Other revenue was DKK 66 million. EBITDA was DKK 961 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 32%. Based on a strong performance in the Travel Health business as well as further clarity on the Public Preparedness business for the remainder of the year, Bavarian Nordic has refined its financial guidance for 2025, which overall remains within the previously announced revenue and EBITDA margin intervals. Full year revenue expectations are narrowed to DKK 6,000-6,600 million, reflecting an upgrade of Travel Health to DKK 2,750 million, which still includes DKK 50-100 million from sale of Vimkunya, and narrowing the Public Preparedness interval to DKK 3,100-3,700 million, with the low end of the interval now secured by contracts. EBITDA margin before special items guidance remains unchanged at 26-30%. When including the net income of DKK 810 million from the recent sale of the Priority Review Voucher, the total EBITDA margin is expected to be 40-42%. DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 2025 Guidance Revenue 1,652 1,427 2,998 2,259 6,000 – 6,600 EBITDA margin before special items 1 33% 29% 32% 20% 26-30% 1 Other operating income of DKK 810 million from the sale of the Priority Review Voucher will be recognized in Q3 2025, contributing to an expected total EBITDA margin of 40-42% for the full year. Paul Chaplin, President & Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic said: “We are pleased to report a strong first half of 2025, which fully captures our successful commercial transformation over the past years, in line with our growth strategy. Our Travel Health business continues to outperform, delivering 24% revenue growth year-over-year, primarily driven by rabies and TBE vaccines. A major highlight for the period was the launch of our chikungunya vaccine for travelers, which is being introduced in more countries as we continue to expand our commercial footprint across new geographies. With the strong performance combined with recent additional orders for our mpox/smallpox vaccine, we refine our full year guidance to reflect higher revenue from Travel Health and a narrower revenue interval for the Public Preparedness business as we have now secured the lower end of our guidance for this business. Overall, we remain within our guided revenue interval and maintain our expectations to an EBITDA margin before special items of 26-30% in 2025. The recent sale of our Priority Review Voucher has generated a one-off income, strengthening our financial position and contributing to an improved result. Hence, the EBITDA margin including special items is expected to be 40-42% for the full year.” Highlights from the period Travel Health Vimkunya was approved in the US, EU and in the UK for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in individuals 12 years and older. The vaccine was launched commercially in the US in March, in Germany in May, and in France in June.

Net sales were DKK 73.7 million as compared to DKK 82.3 million in the 1st half of 2024 due to reduction in properties. The increase in EBVAT was primarily driven by decrease in operating expenses due to decrease in properties and control over expenses (DKK 3.7 million) in overhead expenses (employee benefit and other external expenses) by DKK 5.8 million and reduction in financial expenses by (DKK 6.1 million). Group’s equity as of 30 June 2025 was positive at DKK 980 million. The Board of Directors of Park Street A/S discussed and today approved the company's Interim report 2025, which contained the following: The period in outline Park Street's Profit for the Period (after tax and valuation adjustments) is DKK 17.7 million for the 1st half of 2025 (1st half of 2024: DKK 2.9 million. Park Street achieved EBVAT in the first half of 2025 is DKK 13.7 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 6.5 million). Net sales were DKK 73.7 million as compared to DKK 82.3 million in the 1st half of 2024 due to reduction in properties. The increase in EBVAT was primarily driven by decrease in operating expenses due to decrease in properties and control over expenses (DKK 3.7 million) in overhead expenses (employee benefit and other external expenses) by DKK 5.8 million and reduction in financial expenses by (DKK 6.1 million). Group’s equity as of 30 June 2025 was positive at DKK 980 million. Cash flows from operating activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 2.7 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 20.3 million). The decrease is due to change in operating capital (DKK -11.1 million as compared to DKK 13.4 million in the same period last year) offset by lower financial expenses paid (DKK 31.0 million as compared to DKK 37.2 million in the same period last year). Cash flows from investing activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 22.1 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 74.3 million). The decrease is due to sale of investment property (DKK 28 million) in H1 2025 as compared last year of DKK 282 million, offset of DKK 5.9 million spent on improvements to investment properties across the portfolio and purchase of treasury share of DKK 134.9 million in the 1st half of 2024. Cash flows from financing activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 30.1 million (1st half of 2024: -DKK 101.5 million). The decrease in cash flows driven by repayment of liabilities to credit institutions by DKK 30.1 million (1st half of 2024: -DKK 101.5 million). Expectations for 2025 Park Street’s EBVAT expectations have been revised in view of expected repayment of current loan from new mortgage financing. The Company now expects EBVAT in the range of DKK 20 million to DKK 25 million, compared to the earlier guidance of DKK 30 million to DKK 40 million. In addition, the refinancing will result in a one-time, non-cash capitalised borrowing cost of approximately DKK 22 million, which will be recognised in 2025 and further impact reported EBVAT for the year. Management comments on the interim report In connection with the interim report for H1 2025, CEO Pradeep Pattem states the following: “Park Street delivered a strong operating performance in the first half of 2025 with EBVAT of DKK 13.7 million, more than double compared to the same period last year. This was achieved despite lower rental income from asset sales, reflecting disciplined control of costs and reduced financial expenses. We continued our strategic transition with the sale of Stagehøjvej 22, Silkeborg and thereby further reducing exposure to non-core assets. The capital structure has been simplified with the cancellation of 13.8 million treasury shares approved at the AGM. As at the date of this report, Park Street has received a credit-approved term sheet from a mortgage institution for refinancing of the current loan. The company expects to repay the loan at its scheduled maturity through this new financing. While this will result in a one-time non-cash borrowing cost of approximately DKK 22 million, it will strengthen our long-term funding base and reduce future interest costs. Our Pulse strategy remains central to Park Street’s future. Pulse Norrebro continues at full occupancy with a vibrant international community. We will continue to prioritize technology-driven, design-led property management to enhance tenant experience and sustainability outcomes. For 2025, we now expect EBVAT in the range of DKK 20–25 million compared to earlier guidance of DKK 30–40 million, reflecting refinancing effects and timing of disposals. Park Street remains focused on consolidating around core assets including Pulse platform, reducing exposure to retail and regional assets.” Attached files Interim report 2025 is attached to this announcement.

The report has not been audited. The first half of 2025 shows a much stronger result compared to the same period in 2024. Highlights - Interim Report 2025 Revenue was DKK 9,8 million, while Gross Profit was DKK 7,9 million. Operating Profit (EBITDA) was DKK 0,4 million, a significant increase compared to the same period last year, when EBITDA was DKK -1,65 million. Net profit was DKK -0,6 million compared to DKK -1,9 million last year. DAC signed a contract with the European Space Agency ESA to develop and build a prototype of a new exercise device that can be used on the Lunar Gateway space station orbiting the Moon and eventually for human missions to Mars. DAC entered a new area with a subcontract with Adaptix Ltd. of UK to support the development of a ground prototype of a new 3D Bone Quality Imaging System for future use in space. DAC has completed the first two models of its multifunction exercise device E4D under its ESA contract. This “proto-flight model” of E4D (the first model that will be launched) was shipped to ESA and NASA in January for final integration into the launch vehicle. E4D is currently planned for launch to ISS in early 2026. DAC has entered a strategic partnership with NECAS A/S in order to develop and produce advanced technological solutions applicable across the military, space and extreme environment domains. DAC has merged with its subsidiary Danish Aerospace Medical Company A/S with Danish Aerospace Company A/S as the Continuing Company. As the merged has been adopted by the general assembly after 30 June 2025 the merger has not been recognised in the Interim Financial Statements for the period 1 January - 30 June 2025. In the light of the increased number of DAC shareholders the Board of directors have decided to issue quarterly trading updates starting with Q3 2025. Financial guidance for fiscal year 2025 is maintained. Total Revenue (incl. other income) of DKK 21-23 million; and Operating profit (EBITDA) of approx. DKK 1-3 million. CEO, Thomas A. E. Andersen, states: “With the completion of four full models of our new multifunctional exercise equipment for astronauts, E4D, DAC has now mastered this new complex and critical technology. We look forward to enhancing our exercise technology further for use by ESA and NASA on the Lunar Gateway Space Station to orbit the Moon. In parallel, we are pursuing new areas such as 3D Bone Quality Imaging and use of our wearable technologies for national defense applications.” Management review In the first half of 2025, DAC completed and delivered two additional E4D models bringing the number of completed models to four, for two different customers. The delivery in January of the first proto-flight model for ESA and in August the first model for a commercial customer is another major achievement for E4D. In addition, DAC received a contract from ESA for the development of a prototype of an exercise device for the Lunar Gateway space station to orbit the Moon. This prototype will build upon E4D and add an additional jumping exercise capability to it. DAC continues to see increased interest in various DAC technologies, from almost all of the new private commercial space companies. We have recently entered a new small contract with a new one of them. With the new subcontract with Adaptix Ltd. for support of the development of a ground prototype of a new 3D Bone Quality Imaging System for future use in space, DAC is entering a new area with significant future potential. The new strategic collaboration with NECAS A/S will focus on harnessing the unique synergies between NECAS' expertise in production of electronics for the defense industry and DAC’s world-class expertise in developing medical and exercise systems as well as advanced space and extreme environment technologies. Axiom Space’s Ax-4 mission with astronauts from Hungary, Poland, the USA and India completed a 14-day mission to ISS during which some of the crew members used DAC’s Virtual Reality equipment upgraded with a new eye-tracing capability. DACs work on the new full Water Recovery Unit ground prototype for ESA is progressing as planned. DAC continues to pursue new contracts with ESA and US commercial space companies, as well as within the DoD sector, especially with regard to our wearable monitoring technology. Once again in 2025 DAC successfully passed the quality audit, which is the company’s AS/EN9100 standard, rev. D quality control system approval by Bureau Veritas. Expectations for the year The expectations for the year’s revenue and profit as presented in DAC’s Annual Report 2024 are maintained: Total Revenue (incl. other income) of DKK 21-23 million; and Operating profit (EBITDA) of approx. DKK 1-3 million.

The annual total payment volume is expected to amount to SEK 20 billion once all the new agreements are live (>+40% compared with LTM). Income in the quarter benefited from growth in the SME segment. At the same time income has been impacted by several factors, subduing the overall picture of an otherwise operationally strong quarter with accelerating growth in total payment volume of 37%. The total payment volume increased by 37% to SEK 4.1 billion in the quarter. After three consecutive quarters of negative growth the BNPL volume showed signs of stabilising in Q2 (+1%). In addition the BNPL share increased in July, at the same time as the BNPL volume rose by 9%. Both BNPL share and volume improved in July by +9%. Nevertheless, the BNPL volume is lower than previously expected, which means we expect the forecast income growth to be delayed and realised towards the end of the year. We currently estimate that operating income growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 will be around 15 per cent. Growth is subsequently expected to accelerate into 2026 as income gradually catches up with volume.” Presentation of the Interim Report Today, August 26, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. CEO Christoffer Rutgersson and CFO Carl Löfgren will present the Interim Report for Q2 2025.

The normalised pre-tax result of €2 thousand in the quarter represents an improvement of €0,7 million over Q2 2024. The VA S-Europe division reported sales of €52.9 million in the second quarter, marking a 3% increase from the same period in 2024. Sales for the year's first half increased by 3% in value and 1% in volume compared to 1H 2024. The division's normalised pre-tax profit stood at €2.2 million, the same as for the same period in 2024. Strong sales of premium products, particularly cod and other Icelandic offerings, positively impacted sales value and volume. The production volume of Argentinean shrimp was high but had a lower yield due to the production mix. Sales of Ahumados decreased by 4% in value and volume during 1H 2025. The VA N-Europe division achieved sales of €14.3 million, a 5% rise from Q2 last year. Sales for the first half totalled €28.6 million, up from €26.5 million in the same period of 2024. Lower-than-expected salmon prices at the beginning of the year and into the second quarter positively impacted the operation. In contrast, high prices and the decreased availability of white fish had an opposing impact on the division. The pre-tax profit in Q2 was €0.4 million, up from a loss of (€0.1 million) in the same quarter last year. Price of salmon is expected to remain stable for the rest of the year, with a potential increase toward the end of the year. The S&D division experienced a strong start to the year, driven by robust sales from Iceland, and sustained this momentum through Q2. Strong frozen-at-sea sales, supported by high cod demand, fuelled IS Iceland’s impressive performance during the quarter. Based on the Q2 results and current trading, the normalised PBT outlook 2025 remains between €7.5 million and €9.5 million. We anticipate that cod prices will stay high, while salmon prices will likely remain stable throughout the year. All divisions are expected to deliver on budget, driven by robust fish demand even in the face of higher prices. Ægir Páll Friðbertsson , CEO Ægir Páll Friðbertsson, CEO: "" The first half of 2025 was marked by strong demand for cod and record-high prices. The U.S. ban on Russian fish has pushed up prices for HG cod from the Barents Sea, compounded by quota reductions in both the Barents Sea and the Atlantic. A limited supply of whitefish and elevated prices are expected to persist. Salmon prices were lower than forecasted in the year's first half, resulting in strong operational performance in our salmon operations—unlike the previous two years, when they showed operational loss. Performance in 1H 2025 was significantly better than in 1H 2024, and the outlook for the remainder of the year is positive. We expect salmon prices to remain stable through Q3 and into the latter part of Q4. Our economic outlook remains uncertain and is expected to stay that way. Interest rates have eased, and inflation has declined in our main markets. While high cod prices and rising prices for other species have increased sales values, they also create challenges as consumers face higher costs. As a result, demand may decline further, driven by reduced availability and price increases in key markets. At the same time, financing and storage costs remain significant, reinforcing the need for vigilant credit and inventory management. Our primary focus remains on enhancing the performance of our existing business units, continuously optimising the company’s capital structure, and reassessing our overall strategy. These priorities will guide us in the coming months. We see significant potential for growth within our strong company network, robust sales and sourcing channels, and our highly skilled team of seafood professionals. In July, we took an important step to strengthen our operations in Argentina by signing an offer letter to acquire two vessels, building on our existing knowledge, expertise, and established business in the region. The growth of Icelandic salmon farming is another encouraging development. We have started selling and marketing Icelandic salmon through our network, and we aim to expand this as salmon farming continues to grow in Iceland."" We aim to reinforce Iceland Seafood’s position to navigate future challenges and seize emerging opportunities, ultimately benefiting the company, its owners, and our staff.""

For the second quarter 2025, reported net sales were DKK 2.4 billion with an organic net sales growth of -4%. EBITDA before special items was DKK 499 million with an EBITDA margin of 21.1% compared with 24.5% last year. Free cash flow before acquisitions was DKK 119 million and the adjusted EPS were DKK 3.3. The results support the expectations for the full year which are reaffirmed. The reported net sales were enhanced by the addition of the Mac Baren business, whereas exchange rate developments impacted growth negatively. The development in organic net sales was flat excluding the discontinuation of distribution of ZYN in the US (-3%) and lower sales from contract manufacturing and of accessories in the profitable Australian market. Organic growth recovered in the product categories Handmade Cigars and Machine-Rolled Cigars & Smoking Tobacco and our nicotine pouch brand XQS continued to deliver double digit growth. The EBITDA margin before special items recovered in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of the year leaving the margin for the first six months of the year at 18.8% (21.2%). The decline in the margin compared with 2024 is driven by a combination of product and market mix, investments in re-gaining market shares in machine-rolled cigars in key European markets, discontinuation of distribution of ZYN in the US and generally challenging market conditions. The discontinuation of ZYN will not impact the year-on-year comparisons from the third quarter and onwards. Free cash flow before acquisitions for the first six months improved to DKK 275 million. Second Quarter 2025 Reported net sales decreased by 0.2% to DKK 2.4 billion (DKK 2.4 billion) Organic net sales growth was negative by 4.1% (4.8%) EBITDA margin before special items was 21.1% (24.5%) Adjusted EPS were DKK 3.3 (DKK 4.1) Free cash flow before acquisitions was DKK 119 million (DKK 177 million). Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) was 8.3% (10.5%). First six months 2025 Reported net sales increased by 0.5% to DKK 4.3 billion (DKK 4.3 billion) Organic net sales growth was negative by 6.3% (1.5%) EBITDA margin before special items was 18.8% (21.2%) Adjusted EPS were DKK 4.7 (DKK 5.8) Free cash flow before acquisitions was DKK 275 million (DKK 52 million) CEO Niels Frederiksen: “Despite the challenging market environment driven by tariffs and geopolitical unrest, I am pleased that we have remained focused on delivering on our strategic priorities. The Mac Baren integration is on track to create substantial value, our market positions in machine-rolled cigars have stabilized, and the Growth Enablers continue to enhance our net sales performance. Although the EBITDA margin decreased compared to last year, the results for the second quarter support our expectations for the full year, including delivery of DKK 800-1,000 million in free cash flow before acquisitions. We are in the process of updating our strategy for the next five years to 2030 and I look forward to sharing more details with you later in the year”. Financial expectations for full year 2025 The financial expectations for full year 2025 are maintained. The biggest uncertainties to the expectations are the market developments, including consumer behaviour and pricing for handmade cigars in the US as well as the development of the USD, which in particular can impact reported net sales. Reported net sales DKK 9.1-9.5 billion EBITDA margin before special items 18-22% Free cash flow before acquisitions DKK 0.8-1.0 billion Adjusted EPS DKK 10-13 Guidance and assumptions are based on no impact from potential new acquisitions and at exchange rates as of the reporting date. A 10% change in the USD/DKK exchange rate would impact group net sales by approximately 5 percentage points with EBITDA margins being only marginally impacted.

Start year, the Company restructured to implement a leaner business model and save cost, while allocating all resources to support focused execution of its UK commercial strategy for the Ayla dementia care platform on the attractive UK private care home market. With a robust sales pipeline, including DKK 7.6 million in closable 2025 contracts, 3 care home contracts signed with a combined short-term uplift potential of DKK 0.5 million, growing market engagement and a recent validation of the impact of Ayla in dementia care, Brain+ has built a strong foundation for accelerated pipeline conversion and sales momentum for the rest of 2025. With DKK 0.3 million realized in sales cash flow year to date, Brain+ retains expectations to achieve at least DKK 3.6 million in total contracted sales in 2025. However, due to longer than expected cycles between contracting and cash flow in the introductory phase, expected realized cash flow from sales in 2025 is lowered to DKK 3.0 million from DKK 3.5-3.7 million. Management retains expectations that the Company’s current cash position together with cash flow from sales will be able to finance operations until targeted cash-flow break-even by mid-2026. Following this announcement, Brain+ will issue a separate invitation to an investor webinar, where management will present the half-year report for 2025 and provide additional details on business progress and commercial outlook. Financial results H1 2025: Gross profit of DKK –1.0 million (H1 2024: DKK 1.0 million). The fall in gross profit is solely reflective of development activities being paused in early 2025, which resulted in only insignificant income recognition from work-for-own-cost compared to income recognition of DKK 2.0 million in H1 2024. Staff expenses in H1 2025 amounted to DKK 4.7 million, a fall of 16% compared to DKK 5.7 million in H1 2024. The reduction in staff expenses was the first effect of the restructuring implemented during the period. The net result for the period was DKK – 8.0 million, or DKK -6.0 million excluding the DKK 2.0 million effect of no income recognition from activated development costs (H1 2024: DKK -7.1 million). Cash flow from operating and investment activities (capitalization of work-for-own-cost) amounted to DKK -7.0 million (H1 2024: DKK -7.4 million). Cash flow from financing activities amounted to DKK 11.3 milion, and Brain+ ends the period with a cash position of DKK 4.3 million. Business achievements H1 2025 In H1 2025, Brain+ has carried out a comprehensive restructuring initiative to implement a leaner business model, pause new product development and focus all resources on directly revenue-generating activities in the UK. This initiative followed a deliberate pivot in the Company’s UK commercial strategy to make the UK private care home sector the primary growth engine for the Ayla dementia care platform. In late March 2025, so within months of having entered the UK market, Brain+ secured its first care home operator sales contract with Parkhomes Group (Parkhomes). This was followed in Q2 by two additional sales contracts with Southcare Homes (Southcare) and Majesticare. In total, the three operator contracts cover an initial 7 care homes, validating both the relevance of Ayla to support better dementia care in the care home sector, the company’s target strategy and execution. These early wins represent DKK ~144 thousand (£16,600) in realized and contracted cash flow for 2025 and, more importantly, establish a pathway for significant expansion within existing customer portfolios. In April, Brain+ also signed an extended and expanded evaluation contract for Ayla with Copenhagen municipality with the potential of converting into a multi-year contract from 2026. In connection with the H1 2025 report, Brain+ CEO Devika Wood commented: ""The first half of 2025 has been transformational for Brain+. From the beginning, our vision has been clear: to improve the lives of people living with dementia through better care, powered by innovation. In H1, that vision turned into tangible proof. Ayla moved from promise to validation, from concept to commercial traction. Crucially, we started executing our defined new market opportunity: bringing Ayla directly to the frontline of dementia care in care homes. The sector has long been underserved, and we have pioneered a serviced solution that embeds Ayla at the core of daily practice. By combining digital innovation with Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST), an evidence-based therapy, we are equipping frontline staff to deliver care where it matters most. This is not just incremental change, it is the creation of a new gold standard for dementia care, data-driven and staff-empowered. Within just months of entering the UK market, Brain+ signed its first three operator contracts, bringing Ayla into seven care homes. These deployments are proof of product-market fit and the first step in a scalable growth model, with visibility to expand across a further 22 homes. Importantly, a 14-week pilot with Southcare Homes has already demonstrated measurable improvements in resident well-being, cognition, and staff satisfaction. This validation marks Ayla as a transformative solution for dementia care in the sector. This dual approach of innovation and disciplined market execution has delivered a rapidly expanding pipeline: by mid-August, our UK pipeline represented close to DKK 23 million (£2.66 million) in potential contract value. With reference customers live, clinical validation secured, and a robust sales pipeline, we are well-positioned to accelerate adoption, revenue growth, and impact. We also strengthened our financial foundations. In June, we successfully completed the TO5 funding transaction, raising DKK 5.8 million in gross proceeds, while seeing our first commercial revenues and early benefits of organisational efficiencies. Brain+ is now leaner, sharper, and wholly focused on UK execution. Looking ahead to H2 2025, our focus is disciplined scaling: expanding within existing partner portfolios, converting high-value prospects, and driving NHS opportunities. With innovation proven, validation achieved, and momentum building, Brain+ is positioned to redefine dementia care in the UK and beyond."" Outlook for H2 2025 Business With a sharp commercial focus, validated clinical outcomes, and clear customer traction, Brain+ has built a solid foundation for rapid commercial acceleration in H2 2025 and beyond. Three signed sales contracts and live reference customers now provide both proof of market fit and compelling evidence of Ayla’s impact, creating the conditions for accelerated pipeline conversion. Brain+ enters H2 2025 with strong momentum. Clinical validation is secured, early deployments are delivering measurable results, and the commercial model is scaling. The company is expanding Ayla across existing partner portfolios, deepening NHS engagement, and advancing toward significant market penetration. From an initial seven homes, Brain+ now has visibility to more than 30 homes in the near term, and active discussions with a further 250 homes provide a clear pathway to large-scale adoption. This embedded growth runway positions Brain+ to establish Ayla as the new standard in dementia care. Financial The UK sales pipeline currently represents a potential total contract value of DKK 23 million, with DKK 7.6 million hereof considered closable in 2025. This corresponds to at least DKK 1.9 million in probability weighted cash flow from sales in 2025, which including realised and contracted sales cash flow of DKK 0.3 million year to date provides a current cash flow outlook of DKK 2.2 million for 2025. Based on strong momentum in UK commercial activities, Brain+ management remains confident to achieve at least DKK 3.6 million in contracted sales value in 2025, which is in line with expectations presented in the Company’s Annual Report for 2024. However, initial UK care home engagements have shown longer cycles from contracting to invoicing during the introductory commercial phase for Ayla, and with consequential timing adjustments, realised cash flow from sales in 2025 is now expected at DKK 3.0 million (previously DKK 3.5–3.7 million). Importantly, the adjustments reflects cash flow timing shifts and not lower demand. Sales contracts in 2025 include both annual Ayla license fees and upfront staff training. As a consequence, only a fraction of upcoming contract sales will be recognized as revenue in 2025. Currently, 80–85% of expected sales cash flow in 2025 is forecast to be recognised as revenue only in 2026, and as a consequence, expected recognised sales revenue in 2025 is adjusted to DKK 0.5–0.6 million (from DKK 0.9–1.0 million). Accordingly, and as a consequence also of no income recognition from activated development costs, Brain+ now forecasts a net loss of DKK 10.0–11.0 million for 2025 (down from an expected net loss of DKK 8.0–9.0 million as stated in the 2024 Annual Report). Importantly, the adjustments made to the expectations for 2025 reflect timing shifts and non cash flow impacting lower income recognition. The UK market opportunity is strong, both pipeline value and customer engagement are expanding, and Brain+ management remains confident that the company’s cash position together with cash flow from sales will be able to finance operations until targeted operational break-even by mid-2026. Invitation to investor webinar Brain+ will soon be sending out an invitation to an investor webinar where the Half Year Report 2025 will be presented and where the Company’s management will provide further details on business progress and commercial outlook for the rest of 2025.

Published: 2025-08-28 16:30:13 CEST LR Health & Beauty SE - Inside information LR Health & Beauty SE: Potential breach of Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 - Management Board intends to enter into discussions with bondholders of the 2024/2028 bond ... Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Art. 17 of the Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation – MAR) LR Health & Beauty SE: Potential breach of Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 – Management Board intends to enter into discussions with bondholders of the 2024/2028 bond regarding a precautionary resolution on a waiver of compliance with the Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 and an amendment to the bond terms; adjustment of EBITDA guidance for the financial year 2025. Ahlen, 28 August 2025 – The Management Board of LR Health & Beauty SE (“LR” or the “Company”) resolved today to initiate precautionary negotiations with the holders of the 2024/2028 bond (ISIN: NO0013149658) concerning a proposal to amend the bond terms. The background to this decision is a potential breach by the Company of the covenant under Clause 13.2 of the bond terms, pursuant to which the Company must ensure that net debt in relation to EBITDA does not exceed the threshold of 4.50:1 as at 30 September 2025 (“Leverage Covenant”). Clause 13.2.1 (iii) of the bond terms provides that the Leverage Covenant decreases from 4.75:1 to 4.50:1 with effect from 1 July 2025. Based on the valuation and calculation information currently available, though still preliminary in nature, the Management Board assumes that compliance with the Leverage Covenant on the review date of 30 September 2025 is unlikely. This is due to EBITDA developing less favourably than expected, primarily attributable to increased or increasing costs in the areas of marketing and sales. The Management Board has therefore resolved to enter into precautionary negotiations with the bondholders regarding an amendment to the bond terms – in particular the Leverage Covenant – and, if necessary, to request their consent to a waiver of the Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025. Furthermore, the Management Board will in due course provide information on the further course of action concerning the nature and timing of any vote on an amendment to the bond terms. Furthermore, the Management Board of the Company is adjusting the guidance for the financial year 2025 published on 25 April 2025. With regard to sales (revenue from goods sold), the Management Board now expects a stable development compared with the previous year. Previously, stable to moderately increasing sales had been forecast. EBITDA for the 2025 financial year is now expected to range between EUR 24.0 million and EUR 27.0 million – whereas the previous guidance anticipated significant EBITDA growth compared with the prior-year figure of EUR 27.3 million. The revision of the guidance is essentially due to increased or increasing costs in the areas of marketing and sales. This trend also continued in July, leading the Management Board to conclude that the previous guidance is unlikely to be achieved through catch-up effects or cost-saving measures.

We have seen strong data for Leqembi, a clear increase in sales, continued progress in our development portfolio, and successfully held our first Capital Markets Day. After the end of the second quarter we also signed a new collaboration agreement with another of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. We are already starting to deliver on our newly launched ambitions for 2030. I am particularly excited about our new agreement with Novartis, announced this week. It differs from our previous collaborations as it combines our BrainTransporter™ technology with one of Novartis’ own drug candidates. This is an important recognition of the growing need for precision neurology and of the unique potential of our BrainTransporter platform in particular. The agreement includes an upfront payment of USD 30 million to BioArctic. In the initial research collaboration, we will develop a new drug candidate by combining the BrainTransporter technology with an antibody developed by Novartis. Should Novartis decide to exercise its option after the evaluation, they will assume full responsibility for global development and commercialization. This could result in additional milestone payments of up to USD 772 million, as well as tiered mid-single digit, royalties on future global sales. The agreement highlights the increasing recognition that future treatments for brain diseases will likely re-quire innovative delivery mechanisms – and that our technology is at the forefront of this transformation. Turning to Leqembi, we continue to see strong momentum. Sales increased significantly during the quarter and our royalty revenue reached SEK 162.5 million – an increase of around 280 percent compared with the same quarter last year, and approximately 60 percent compared with the previous quarter. We are looking forward to seeing the development in the EU now that the launch has just started in Austria and soon also in Germany. In the Nordics, Eisai has now submitted dossiers regarding price and recommended use to all relevant authorities in all countries and the launch preparations are progressing as planned. The growing number of patients benefiting from Leqembi also means that more and more data is being generated on how the drug works outside of clinical trials. At the AAIC conference (Alzheimer’s Association International Conference) at the end of July, several presentations addressed precisely this. One of the highlights was data from an ongoing real world evidence study at nine clinics in the USA, which showed that 84 percent of patients treated with Leqembi remained stable or improved after an average of one year of treatment, while safety data were in line with phase 3. These are very strong data, and I look forward to seeing results from the full study towards the end of 2025. Eisai also presented new data from the phase 3 open label extension study, showing that for patients treated with lecanemab for four years, the disease progression was delayed by about a year compared to the natural course of the disease, and the benefit increased the longer the patients remained on treatment. Lastly, data from studies regarding the subcutaneous dosing form of Leqembi, which supported the application currently being reviewed by the FDA in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and usage. Subcutaneous dosing will allow patients to easily and within 15 seconds be treated at home, enabling continued treatment without visiting an infusion center. In addition to Eisai's presentations at AAIC, new guidelines for the use of blood biomarkers in the diagnosis process were presented. This will have a major impact on the possibility to find and diagnose more patients at an early stage, which is important for achieving the best possible effect with Leqembi. An indirect treatment comparison study was also presented, concluding that Leqembi has the lowest risk of ARIA-related side effects out of the two anti-amyloid antibodies available on the market. Exidavnemab, our most advanced project within alpha-synucleopathies such as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA), has made considerable progress during the quarter. First and foremost, the first part of the phase 2a study has been completed with results that support continued development and have allowed us to proceed to the higher dose in the second part of the study. Initially, we intended to include only Parkinson's patients but will now also include twelve MSA patients in part two. This is particularly important as we have received orphan designation for exidavnemab in both the US and EU for the MSA indication, which among other things enables a faster development path going forward. Finally, at our capital markets day, we launched our ambitions for 2030 focused on establishing Leqembi as treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, building a broader and more balanced pipeline, adding more global long-term partnerships and becoming sustainably profitable, enabling recurring dividends. To achieve this, we will increase our investments in innovation while broadening our focus in severe brain diseases. Guided by our 2030 ambitions, we will continue to build Bio-Arctic for the benefit of both patients and shareholders. With steadily increasing royalty revenues, a drug soon ready for launch in Europe and the Nordics, an additional BrainTransporter partnership, and an organization prepared for the next step on our journey, the future looks bright for BioArctic.

We have seen strong data for Leqembi, a clear increase in sales, continued progress in our development portfolio, and successfully held our first Capital Markets Day. After the end of the second quarter we also signed a new collaboration agreement with another of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. We are already starting to deliver on our newly launched ambitions for 2030. I am particularly excited about our new agreement with Novartis, announced this week. It differs from our previous collaborations as it combines our BrainTransporter™ technology with one of Novartis’ own drug candidates. This is an important recognition of the growing need for precision neurology and of the unique potential of our BrainTransporter platform in particular. The agreement includes an upfront payment of USD 30 million to BioArctic. In the initial research collaboration, we will develop a new drug candidate by combining the BrainTransporter technology with an antibody developed by Novartis. Should Novartis decide to exercise its option after the evaluation, they will assume full responsibility for global development and commercialization. This could result in additional milestone payments of up to USD 772 million, as well as tiered mid-single digit, royalties on future global sales. The agreement highlights the increasing recognition that future treatments for brain diseases will likely re-quire innovative delivery mechanisms – and that our technology is at the forefront of this transformation. Turning to Leqembi, we continue to see strong momentum. Sales increased significantly during the quarter and our royalty revenue reached SEK 162.5 million – an increase of around 280 percent compared with the same quarter last year, and approximately 60 percent compared with the previous quarter. We are looking forward to seeing the development in the EU now that the launch has just started in Austria and soon also in Germany. In the Nordics, Eisai has now submitted dossiers regarding price and recommended use to all relevant authorities in all countries and the launch preparations are progressing as planned. The growing number of patients benefiting from Leqembi also means that more and more data is being generated on how the drug works outside of clinical trials. At the AAIC conference (Alzheimer’s Association International Conference) at the end of July, several presentations addressed precisely this. One of the highlights was data from an ongoing real world evidence study at nine clinics in the USA, which showed that 84 percent of patients treated with Leqembi remained stable or improved after an average of one year of treatment, while safety data were in line with phase 3. These are very strong data, and I look forward to seeing results from the full study towards the end of 2025. Eisai also presented new data from the phase 3 open label extension study, showing that for patients treated with lecanemab for four years, the disease progression was delayed by about a year compared to the natural course of the disease, and the benefit increased the longer the patients remained on treatment. Lastly, data from studies regarding the subcutaneous dosing form of Leqembi, which supported the application currently being reviewed by the FDA in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and usage. Subcutaneous dosing will allow patients to easily and within 15 seconds be treated at home, enabling continued treatment without visiting an infusion center. In addition to Eisai's presentations at AAIC, new guidelines for the use of blood biomarkers in the diagnosis process were presented. This will have a major impact on the possibility to find and diagnose more patients at an early stage, which is important for achieving the best possible effect with Leqembi. An indirect treatment comparison study was also presented, concluding that Leqembi has the lowest risk of ARIA-related side effects out of the two anti-amyloid antibodies available on the market. Exidavnemab, our most advanced project within alpha-synucleopathies such as Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy (MSA), has made considerable progress during the quarter. First and foremost, the first part of the phase 2a study has been completed with results that support continued development and have allowed us to proceed to the higher dose in the second part of the study. Initially, we intended to include only Parkinson's patients but will now also include twelve MSA patients in part two. This is particularly important as we have received orphan designation for exidavnemab in both the US and EU for the MSA indication, which among other things enables a faster development path going forward. Finally, at our capital markets day, we launched our ambitions for 2030 focused on establishing Leqembi as treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, building a broader and more balanced pipeline, adding more global long-term partnerships and becoming sustainably profitable, enabling recurring dividends. To achieve this, we will increase our investments in innovation while broadening our focus in severe brain diseases. Guided by our 2030 ambitions, we will continue to build Bio-Arctic for the benefit of both patients and shareholders. With steadily increasing royalty revenues, a drug soon ready for launch in Europe and the Nordics, an additional BrainTransporter partnership, and an organization prepared for the next step on our journey, the future looks bright for BioArctic.

The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact persons set out above, at 7.45 am CET on August 28, 2025. CEO’s Review Q2 saw a solid quarter of delivery in line with expectations, finishing off the quarter with three launches to add to four in Q1 2025, taking the total launched in 2025 so far to seven launches, with a solid pipeline of launches to come during Q3 2025 and beyond. I am particularly excited to see the launch of our first operator in the Philippines, which is fast becoming a key focal market for us. There is significant potential to be realised from the opportunities within this region, and I anticipate both our partner and the market in general to deliver significant revenue upside in the near to mid-term. Indeed, we see increasing potential not just in the APAC region but in the broader emerging markets, including LatAm, Eastern Europe and Africa, where iGaming regulation is evolving and creating substantial expansion opportunities for GiG. In these markets we intend to enter into larger, more strategic agreements with our partners, delivering a higher return on investment. This strategy also aligns with increased investor interest from emerging markets as demonstrated by the €4.7 million directed equity issue completed in June, which has strengthened our balance sheet and will allow us to act swiftly on strategic investments and business opportunities in line with our growth strategy whilst adding new investors to our shareholder base. Following the end of the quarter, we announced that an additional subscription undertaking had been received for a total consideration of approximately €22 million. This will allow us to capitalise even further upon new market opportunities whilst adding additional support to our balance sheet enabling us to accelerate plans to execute on our business strategy. I am delighted that following the end of the quarter, we have entered into a Heads of Terms to migrate a European Lottery’s online casino vertical onto GiG’s iGaming platform in H1-26. This is a significant milestone as not only does it represent the first Lottery win for the business, but it will also open up additional opportunities in this sector in the future and demonstrates further evidence that our technology is suited to both Tier 1 partners and market leaders in their respective regions. Whilst I am pleased that we have launched seven partners during the first half of this year, this is not where we would have aspired to have been at this point of the year, reflecting current market dynamics. Our focus has been very much on ensuring quality delivery and partnering with the right customers; however, this has meant that the launch cadence has not been realised at the speed that we had anticipated. To expand upon this further, the market sentiment and regulatory developments surrounding Sweepstakes in the US has had a negative impact, meaning that some partners have adopted more caution in entering this market. This, coupled with regulatory and market readiness delays for some of our partners, has contributed to the postponement of certain launches during the period. Once again, our cost control focus has delivered a sharp increase in both adjusted EBITDA and EBIT of €2.1 million and €2.9 million respectively, with GiG’s adjusted EBITDA achieving €1.0 million for the quarter. This is a testament to the scalability of our business model, and we are beginning to realise the potential for margin generation within our operations. Q2 saw another quarter of pipeline conversions, with three new commercial agreements signed alongside four new managed services agreements once again showcasing GiG’s ability to win new contracts amongst a backdrop of delivering a market-leading product to our existing partners. We are maintaining investment in both our product and sales execution to ensure that both our product and pipeline remain robust, and we continue to supply our partners with the very best in iGaming services and technology whilst attracting new, quality customers to our platform. The additional capital made available through the shareholder undertakings will support these initiatives and provide us with additional fuel for growth. In the light of all these developments, we have reassessed our guidance for 2025 accordingly, and have also provided guidance for 2026 revenue and EBITDA. With our focus on key new markets that are delivering significant mid-term growth, alongside our strengthened balance sheet and corresponding ability to strategically target high quality, experienced partners, I am happy that we can now share our growth targets for the mid-term, as set out in our aforementioned guidance. Overall, I am pleased with our progress in H1 2025 and am excited about what the future holds. Our strengthened financial position will enable us to make necessary investments in product development and new market opportunities which will position GiG for sustainable, long-term profitable growth; the future has never been brighter.

Improved cash flow and solid performance in Europe First quarter summary Despite a slight decline in orders during the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remains above 1, reflecting a healthy business environment. Net sales at constant exchange rates grew by 3 percent, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe, where our latest linear accelerator, Elekta Evo, and our new software suite, Elekta ONE, are gaining traction as online adaptive treatment capabilities continue to set new benchmarks in the market. The adjusted gross margin in Q1 was impacted by normal seasonality and continued negative FX effects, resulting in a year-over-year decrease to 37.0 percent (37.8). In addition, this quarter had a negative impact from tariffs of SEK 33 M, which weighed on the margin performance by 90 bps. The negative impact was partly offset by price improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin for the first quarter came in at 6.5 percent, compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher amortization and lower capitalization, although this was partly offset by reduced selling and administrative expenses, reflecting the effect from our continued cost-saving initiatives. Operating cash flow after continuous investments improved by SEK 529 million, reaching SEK -361 million in the first quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by improved working capital management. Investor update On June 10, we held an Investor Update with the purpose of providing an update of our progress across several key projects as well as presenting the strong fundamentals of the radiation therapy industry. We reiterated the roadmap to achieve our mid-term financial objectives. This includes restoring the gross margin to pre-pandemic levels and reaching an EBIT margin of at least 14 percent. Key drivers are growing volumes, enhanced pricing supported by new product launches, an improved product mix, and accelerated expansion in mature markets. As part of our commitment to operational excellence, we also presented the result of a proactive order review aimed at increasing the quality of the backlog to improve profitability and predictability. Commercial milestones During the quarter, we delivered several important commercial wins with Elekta Evo and our software suite Elekta ONE. For example, we concluded a comprehensive deal including some of our most advanced solutions to the University of Texas Southwestern. Leksell Gamma Knife received FDA 510(k) clearance for treating a certain type of epilepsy, which is an important step towards expanding the scope of radiosurgery. We have also noted that the ERECT trial, demonstrating Elekta Unity’s capability to treat prostate cancer while preserving erectile function, has gained significant attention. Outlook We expect net sales for Q2 to be negatively impacted by a continued weak US development as well as a negative effect from last year's low order intake in China. However, we expect sales in China to start to recover during the second half of 2025/26. Furthermore, we expect a continuous negative impact on earnings from FX at current exchange rates and from tariffs in Q2. We reiterate our full year 2025/26 outlook, where we expect net sales in constant currency to grow year-over-year. I would like to end my CEO comment by welcoming Jakob Just-Bomholt as Elekta’s new CEO. Jakob is a highly experienced international executive with a successful career and CEO positions in various global industries, including the medtech sector. Jakob will assume his new role as CEO on September 1.

Improved cash flow and solid performance in Europe First quarter summary Despite a slight decline in orders during the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remains above 1, reflecting a healthy business environment. Net sales at constant exchange rates grew by 3 percent, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe, where our latest linear accelerator, Elekta Evo, and our new software suite, Elekta ONE, are gaining traction as online adaptive treatment capabilities continue to set new benchmarks in the market. The adjusted gross margin in Q1 was impacted by normal seasonality and continued negative FX effects, resulting in a year-over-year decrease to 37.0 percent (37.8). In addition, this quarter had a negative impact from tariffs of SEK 33 M, which weighed on the margin performance by 90 bps. The negative impact was partly offset by price improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin for the first quarter came in at 6.5 percent, compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher amortization and lower capitalization, although this was partly offset by reduced selling and administrative expenses, reflecting the effect from our continued cost-saving initiatives. Operating cash flow after continuous investments improved by SEK 529 million, reaching SEK -361 million in the first quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by improved working capital management. Investor update On June 10, we held an Investor Update with the purpose of providing an update of our progress across several key projects as well as presenting the strong fundamentals of the radiation therapy industry. We reiterated the roadmap to achieve our mid-term financial objectives. This includes restoring the gross margin to pre-pandemic levels and reaching an EBIT margin of at least 14 percent. Key drivers are growing volumes, enhanced pricing supported by new product launches, an improved product mix, and accelerated expansion in mature markets. As part of our commitment to operational excellence, we also presented the result of a proactive order review aimed at increasing the quality of the backlog to improve profitability and predictability. Commercial milestones During the quarter, we delivered several important commercial wins with Elekta Evo and our software suite Elekta ONE. For example, we concluded a comprehensive deal including some of our most advanced solutions to the University of Texas Southwestern. Leksell Gamma Knife received FDA 510(k) clearance for treating a certain type of epilepsy, which is an important step towards expanding the scope of radiosurgery. We have also noted that the ERECT trial, demonstrating Elekta Unity’s capability to treat prostate cancer while preserving erectile function, has gained significant attention. Outlook We expect net sales for Q2 to be negatively impacted by a continued weak US development as well as a negative effect from last year's low order intake in China. However, we expect sales in China to start to recover during the second half of 2025/26. Furthermore, we expect a continuous negative impact on earnings from FX at current exchange rates and from tariffs in Q2. We reiterate our full year 2025/26 outlook, where we expect net sales in constant currency to grow year-over-year. I would like to end my CEO comment by welcoming Jakob Just-Bomholt as Elekta’s new CEO. Jakob is a highly experienced international executive with a successful career and CEO positions in various global industries, including the medtech sector. Jakob will assume his new role as CEO on September 1.

We are also seeing steady progress in our Healthcare segment, where RTX products remain critical components in advanced patient monitoring systems. Although short order cycles continue to limit forecast visibility, demand patterns across quarters are becoming more stable. We are increasing our efforts to follow ongoing market dynamics and trends, in order to better align with customer expectations and evolving market demands. At the end of June, we raised our full-year guidance, as strong Q3 result became evident and several orders for Q4 were secured. U.S. tariffs continue to create uncertainty, and we are working closely with our large international customers to find the best solutions. With strong expertise and a global customer base, the Company has a solid foundation. By expanding our footprint and focusing on strategic priorities, we are reinforcing our ability to drive sustainable growth and long-term value .” Henrik Mørck Mogensen, CEO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue for Q3 2024/25 increased by 3.5% year on year to 146.9 DKKm, compared to 141.9 DKKm in Q3 2023/24. Adjusted for currency effects, revenue for the quarter increased by 9.9%. For the first nine months of 2024/25, revenue rose by 16.7% year on year to 407.3 DKKm, and by 18.0% when adjusted for currency effects. Gross margin reached 51.7% for Q3 2024/25, and 50.7% for the first 9M 2024/25. Gross margin improved due to a favourable product mix and higher revenue from the Healthcare segment. EBITDA reached 15.0 DKKm for Q3 2024/25, and 22.2 DKKm for 9M 2024/25 (Q3 2023/24: 9.4 DKKm, 9M: -20.1 DKKm). GUIDANCE On 23 June 2025, RTX adjusted the guidance for 2024/25, and with the announcement of this interim report the intervals are narrowed by raising the lower range of EBITDA and EBIT by 10 DKKm: Revenue DKK 530 to 560 million (from DKK 490 to 530 million) EBITDA DKK 25 to 35 million (from DKK 0 to 20 million) EBIT DKK -5 to 5 million (from DKK -35 to -15 million) BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Continued strong performance in Enterprise segment driven mainly by customers in the retail sector and long-term customers demand across applications. The Healthcare segment delivered solid revenue growth, driven by sales of RTX products used in patient monitoring systems. While the order horizon remains short and creates uncertainty in our forecast, we see more stable and even demand patterns between quarters. Reduction in inventory from 74.1 DKKm in Q2 to 56.5 DKKm in Q3, mainly due to reduction in component inventory. Increase in guidance for the financial year 2024/25 was communicated on 23 June 2025.

We focused on strengthening our financial position by listing our bond on Nasdaq Helsinki. The listing was successfully carried out after the reporting period in July. This achievement represents a significant milestone for our company, and I am proud of our team for their commitment, expertise, and determination that made it possible – given the scale of the work required, it was a major achievement by our small team. Strengthening our ownership base to support our growth ambitions remains a strategic priority, and this process is continuing. Focusing on operational efficiency In the meantime, we are focusing on operational efficiency and making the most of our existing equipment, ensuring that our activities are optimised to meet demand and maintain our solid operational performance. The fundamentals of our business remain strong, and our core operations continue to generate a steady, predictable cash flow supported by long-term rental agreements. Increasing reuse of modular units expands business opportunities In the second quarter, customer demand remained stable, and our pipeline of requests is on par with previous quarters. At the same time, we have observed positive developments in the acceptance of reused modular units, with many municipalities now allowing them in competitive tenders – a shift that expands our business opportunities even further. In the second quarter, we delivered a notable project in Kankaanpää: a 580-square metre daycare facility installed in a single day, reflecting the results of our development work and cutting work time by a third compared to our previous approach. This is a strong demonstration of our ability to carry out installation projects quickly and efficiently, giving us a competitive advantage in service speed. Service business at the core of our operations At our core, we are in the service business – specialising in rental solutions and space services that provide municipalities with healthy, sustainable, and adaptable facilities. While the buildings are designed by us and constructed through our trusted subcontractor network, our role is to own, lease, and manage them as part of our flexible service offering. Our current strategy prioritises schools and daycares, while we also actively explore opportunities across the broader space needs of public-sector customers, such as healthcare facilities – a promising market segment where we plan to develop our service concept further in the coming quarters. Sustainable by nature Sustainability is an integral part of how we operate. Our Modulo 3.0 building solution is designed to help municipalities meet their carbon neutrality targets through renewable, recyclable, and wood-based materials, while its relocatable design reduces environmental impact. With our strong operational base, established market position, and proven service model, we are in an excellent position to pursue growth and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.

Revenue rose by 17% compared to the same quarter last year, reaching EUR 622 million, while gross profit grew by 17% to EUR 143 million. This development was supported by double-digit growth in both air and ocean freight, as well as continued contributions from our strategic acquisitions in Brazil, Italy, and most recently Canada. In the first half of 2025, revenue increased by 24% to EUR 1,263 million, while gross profit grew by 16% to EUR 275 million. EBITDA before special items reached EUR 94 million – up 13% – driven by higher volumes and effective utilisation of our network, although higher costs for integration and capacity building affected the conversion ratio. Our commercial momentum, especially in EMEA and Asia, confirms the value of local execution and close customer engagement. However, it is important to note that Q2 was significantly impacted by front-loading of volumes, particularly related to the US tariff situation. This has inflated activity levels in the quarter, while underlying year-to-date airfreight development remains negative.” Selected key figures and ratios EURm Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 Revenue 622 532 1,263 1,022 Gross profit 143 122 275 238 EBITDA before special items 51 43 94 83 Operating cash flow for the period (10) (13) (8) (71) Gross margin (%) 23.0 22.9 21.8 23.3 Conversion ratio (%) 35.7 35 .2 34.2 34.9 Revenue - The revenue in Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 622m an increase of 17% compared to EUR 532m in Q2 2024, primarily driven by organic activity in Asia and EMEA and our recent acquisitions. H1 2025 revenue amounted to EUR 1,263m an increase of 24% compared to EUR 1,022m in H1 2024 mainly impacted by the continued growth in Air & Ocean in Asia, especially China and Hong Kong, and network effect from investments in Italy and Brazil. The acquisition of ITN in Canada got off to a positive start in the SGL family. However, integration is still ongoing. Gross profit - The gross profit Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 143m, an increase of 17% compared to EUR 122m in Q2 2024, primarily due to front-loading of shipments and inventory stocking coming from the US tariffs situation. The gross profit in H1 2025 amounted to EUR 275m, an increase of 16% compared to EUR 238m in H1 2024, particularly driven by last year's acquisitions in Brazil and Italy, partly supported by ITN combined with double-digit growth in Air & Ocean volumes. Gross margin - The gross margin has been challenged in H1 2025 and was 21.8% compared to 23.3% in H1 2024. EBITDA before special items - EBITDA before special items in Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 51m, an increase of 19% compared to EUR 43m in Q2 2024. The EBITDA before special items amounted to EUR 94m for H1 2025, an increase of 13% compared to EUR 83m in H1 2024. Conversion ratio - The conversion ratio has increased by 0.5%-points in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The conversion ratio has decreased by 0.7%-points in H1 2025 compared to H1 2024 deriving from higher SG&A costs. Cash flow from operating activities - Cash flow from operating activities improved with EUR 3m in Q2 2025 compared to Q2 2024. The cash flow from operating activities in H1 2025 improved with EUR 63m compared to H1 2024, primarily impacted by the increase in NWC in Q1 2024 and a more muted NWC development in 2025. 2025 Outlook - In the first half of 2025, we delivered a stable performance with growth in Air & Ocean volumes, increasing our EBITDA before special items compared to the first half of 2024. However, we have been highly impacted by the geopolitical turmoil impacting the global freight market, especially around the Red Sea and the US tariff situation. Besides these factors impacting on our outlook, we also operate in a historically competitive market environment shaped by the increased level of consolidation in the industry, resulting in intensified pressure on organic growth in our market share. Despite the challenging market conditions, we maintain our outlook for EBITDA before special items of EUR 215m – EUR 235m.

H1 2025 revenue amounted to EUR 1,263m an increase of 24% compared to EUR 1,022m in H1 2024 mainly impacted by the continued growth in Air & Ocean in Asia, especially China and Hong Kong, and network effect from investments in Italy and Brazil. The acquisition of ITN in Canada got off to a positive start in the SGL family. However, integration is still ongoing. Gross profit - The gross profit Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 143m, an increase of 17% compared to EUR 122m in Q2 2024, primarily due to front-loading of shipments and inventory stocking coming from the US tariffs situation. The gross profit in H1 2025 amounted to EUR 275m, an increase of 16% compared to EUR 238m in H1 2024, particularly driven by last year's acquisitions in Brazil and Italy, partly supported by ITN combined with double-digit growth in Air & Ocean volumes. Gross margin - The gross margin has been challenged in H1 2025 and was 21.8% compared to 23.3% in H1 2024. EBITDA before special items - EBITDA before special items in Q2 2025 amounted to EUR 51m, an increase of 19% compared to EUR 43m in Q2 2024.

The cash flow from operating activities in H1 2025 improved with EUR 63m compared to H1 2024, primarily impacted by the increase in NWC in Q1 2024 and a more muted NWC development in 2025. 2025 Outlook - In the first half of 2025, we delivered a stable performance with growth in Air & Ocean volumes, increasing our EBITDA before special items compared to the first half of 2024. However, we have been highly impacted by the geopolitical turmoil impacting the global freight market, especially around the Red Sea and the US tariff situation. Besides these factors impacting on our outlook, we also operate in a historically competitive market environment shaped by the increased level of consolidation in the industry, resulting in intensified pressure on organic growth in our market share. Despite the challenging market conditions, we maintain our outlook for EBITDA before special items of EUR 215m – EUR 235m.

CEO's Comments on Q2 2025 Performance A solid quarter dominated by app store rulings and FX swings. We started Q2 with strong momentum in distribution, building on the success of Q1's new game launches. I am pleased to say that the new games are already contributing with more than USD 600k in revenue per month and supported our continued growth in the quarter. In USD terms, Distribution revenue was up 4% and Audiencly by 5% year-on-year. While our total reported revenue in GBP saw a 4% decline due to a weaker USD, this does not reflect our underlying performance. Audiencly's return to profitability in Q2 came on the back of a record number of clients served in Q1 with an average margin for the first half of the year at approximately 30%. Despite the typically slower summer period and a challenging market for games, we met our revenue guidance. Notably, our game portfolio and channels significantly outperformed its Google Play equivalents which experienced a 27% decline in the same period based on AppMagic figures, underscoring the clear shift towards alternative markets, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels. In Q2, we made progress on game launches and sourcing. We successfully signed ""Realms of Pixel"" and officially launched EA's ""Golf Clash."" We also secured another top 5 grossing game, yet to be fully launched. Looking ahead to Q3, our game portfolio now features 34 games and is expected to include four Top 10 grossing games (based on Google Play ranking). The average monthly revenue of our top tier games in Q2 was USD 700k. Having secured 4 out of 10 top grossing games is a major achievement for Flexion, making us uniquely attractive to existing and new distribution channels, as well as marketing and payment partners. This strategic advantage should help us maintain current momentum and secure more new deals into the autumn. I anticipate performance to pick up towards the end of Q3 once the summer period concludes, expecting revenue in the range of USD 21-24 million for the quarter. As highlighted in Q1, the amortization of our game distribution rights has significantly decreased, with our largest deal now fully amortized, leading to a closer alignment between our adjusted EBITDA and operating result. As our largest deal transitioned back to standard terms, our distribution gross margin declined as expected, reflecting the contractual shift in economics once our investment in the game was recouped. This outcome underscores both our commitment to bringing successful titles to alternative app stores and the underlying strength of these top-grossing games. Meanwhile, Audiencly’s gross margin improved, contributing to a consolidated company gross margin of 14%. I am also pleased to report that we have successfully extended and renewed several crucial developer agreements, providing greater revenue visibility over the next few years. We are in a strong financial position, with GBP 13.3 million in the bank and no debt, enabling us to continue strategic investments such as in our D2C initiatives. Total investment in product development so far this year is approximately GBP 0.4m. The alternative market continues to be shaped by pivotal legal decisions, with court rulings against Apple and Google in the US, alongside enforcement actions by the EU and other regulatory bodies in major mobile games markets. It is unequivocally clear that the long-standing ""walls"" of control on both iOS (Apple) and Android (Google Play) are coming down, and this shift is irreversible. This paradigm creates unprecedented new market opportunities for game developers and service providers. The growth of the mobile games market has long been constrained by Google and Apple's strict control. We firmly believe it is now poised to re-enter a period of growth, as increased developer freedoms, higher margins, and intensified competition will collectively drive significant investment and expansion in game marketing. For example, we are seeing increased capital investment activity in D2C payment and web store startups. For instance, Appcharge, a payments company we are working with, recently raised USD 58 million, bringing their total funding over the past nine months to USD 89 million. Besides continued investment in our SDK, our support for D2C includes integrations with Appcharge for in-app payments, alongside Xsolla and Coda Payments. On the product development side, we are also adding support for the Epic Games Store this year. Over the past 12 months, we have streamlined operations in Distribution, reducing headcount by 8% while improving overall efficiency. At the same time, we continue to invest in product development. Our teams recently returned from China Joy, Asia's largest game show and Gamescom in Europe, and the trend is clear: alternative stores are now firmly integrated into most game developers' user acquisition strategies, as return on ad spend (ROAS) can be higher due to more attractive payouts from these stores. This is a very important first step as the pace of change will depend heavily on paid user acquisition being funnelled through to new and high margin stores and D2C. We continue to develop expertise in user acquisition for the alternative markets and are seeing strong performance with certain games and channel combinations. For both existing and new stores, the ability to offer their services through Google Play thanks to the recent rulings will be tremendously beneficial, significantly reducing user friction and greatly assisting with user acquisition. We believe this will lead to an increased number of stores and empower developers to transform their web stores into powerful distribution channels over time. We are actively building for this open, competitive market, which represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity for developers. With our strong game and store partnerships, we are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalise on these emerging opportunities, and it is crucial that we continue to strategically invest in our robust service offering to remain at the forefront as the market transitions. I will continue to update you on our progress in these areas in Q3 and wish you a happy end to the summer season.

Revenue for H1 increased by 21%, while capacity costs (other external expenses and staff costs) in the same period increased by 14%, contributing to improvement in EBITDA and lower cash burn from operations.

These organizations span industries including financial services, manufacturing, shipping, and IT services. By the end of H1 2025, Impero served 32% of the Danish C25 index and 20% of the German DAX 40 index, with the majority of the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) generated outside Denmark. While Q1 typically shows limited momentum due to customers’ fiscal year-end processes, Q2 is traditionally a stronger period. However, Q2 2025 fell short of expectations, with macroeconomic uncertainty where potential new customers seemed more cautious than usual. Despite this, we achieved gross ARR growth of DKK 3.5M in H1 2025. This was largely driven by significant upsell activity among existing customers, especially large enterprises in Germany’s automotive and manufacturing sectors, as well as customers in other markets who are expanding the use of Impero across their organizations. However, contractions impacted our net new ARR which ended at DKK 2M for the period. Due to continued focus on customer success and platform adoption, churn remained below 2% over the past 12 months. “While the first half of the year presented some challenges, we remain optimistic. Market potential is intact, and Impero is well positioned to continue our growth journey. We see strong demand for our intuitive, easy-to-implement platform that enables organizations to meet rising requirements for risk management and internal controls. With a remarkable customer base, an expanding partner network, a strengthened team, and enhanced product development, we are well equipped for the road ahead”, says CEO Rikke Stampe Skov. Partnerships to support growth Partnerships continue to be a strategic pillar in our efforts to help organizations navigate compliance challenges. We collaborate closely with experts in governance, risk, and compliance, particularly across tax and finance domains. These partnerships support efficient implementation of Impero and provide access to best practice templates developed by our partners. Of new ARR generated in H1 2025, 33% originated through the partner channel. As a result of ongoing investments in partner development, we saw greater engagement throughout H1 particularly in Germany, where we onboarded new partners and secured our first customers through two of these. We believe the partner channel will remain a key driver for growth. Enhancing platform value The first half of 2025 marked a significant step forward in our mission to simplify compliance through strengthening risk & internal control management for enterprise- and highly-regulated organizations. Guided by our strategic direction, we focus on delivering high-impact capabilities that expand our platform’s value, improve operational oversight, and support more efficient workflows. Following a successful beta period throughout H1 2025, we launched Control Testing into general availability in July 2025. This module introduces a structured, audit-friendly way to assess the effectiveness of internal controls empowering organizations to proactively identify weaknesses, refine processes, and strengthen overall compliance assurance. In alignment with our general practices, Control Testing has been developed with extensive feedback from our customers, and we are already seeing solid interest from new and existing customers with several beta customers already using the feature to embed proactive testing into their compliance frameworks. Strategy update As part of our 2026 strategy “Increasing the Impact”, we remain focused on enhancing platform capabilities and accelerating delivery speed. We are investing in Product and Development team capacity, while also scaling our go-to-market efforts across geographies and channels to drive pipeline development and market expansion. Following limited traction with templated compliance solutions in the mid-market, and based on the EU Omnibus package, we will continue to concentrate on the enterprise segment where we have a proven track record of attracting and expanding customer relationships. This focused approach means we do not anticipate doubling our customer base by the end of 2026. Though ARR growth in H1 2025 was more modest than anticipated, we remain confident in being able to become cash flow positive before the end of 2026. Equity and capital Impero maintained a solid cash position of DKK 6.8M at the end of H1 2025. The company continues to apply a balanced approach to investment and cash generation, ensuring sufficient liquidity to pursue its strategic plan. As of 30 June 2025, Impero’s equity stood at DKK 0.2M, compared to DKK 6.2M at 31 December 2024. This reduction, which represents a loss of more than 50% of the company’s share capital, reflects the investments made to support long-term growth. It is not unusual for SaaS companies in growth phases to experience periods of negative equity as product development and market scaling are prioritized over short-term profitability. Despite this equity shortfall, Impero remains in a solid financial position. In accordance with the Danish Companies Act, the Board of Directors is currently assessing options to address the equity position. If relevant, an update will be provided at a general assembly no later than the end of November 2025. Organizational developments As communicated in Company Announcement 09-2025, our CFO Morten Lehmann Nielsen will be stepping down at the end of August to pursue a career opportunity outside of Impero. We thank Morten for his contribution over the past 3½ years and wish him all the best in his future role. On 25 August 2025 Impero announced the appointment of Kasper Lihn as CFO, effective 1 October 2025 (Company Announcement No. 15-2025). We are excited to welcome Kasper, who joins Impero from HC Andersen Capital, where he holds the position Head of Research and Managing Director. Outlook Impero maintains the updated ARR guidance for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range. The outlook corresponds to an expected annual ARR growth rate between 11% and 19%. The company’s EBITDA is expected to be in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025), with continued focus on cost discipline in light of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) developing below initial expectations, impacting the timing of new initiatives. For the full outlook, we refer to page 8 in the H1 Report 2025. Presentation of the Report Read the Report in its entirety via or in the attached.

Highlights: Strong financial performance: record-high H1 EBITDA of EUR 93m and last 12 months EBITDA of EUR 239m due to strong project sales performance. Outlook for 2025 is maintained at EUR 200-300m based on the satisfactory H1 2025 results and a strong project sales pipeline. The likelihood of an EBITDA in the lower half of the range has increased due to the H1 2025 power sales performance being below expectations and to the headwinds in some of our market where project sales are at risk of taking longer time and could slip into 2026. To be in the upper half of our guidance, strong traction and execution on our +20 ongoing sales transactions are needed. Growth in Power Sales : gross profit of EUR 33m (+20% YoY) due to 1,063 GWh produced (+4% YoY) and higher compensation received from a supplier due to performance issues Satisfactory Project Divestments : 8 projects totalling 1.2GW divested across 3 transactions generating EUR 99m in gross profit up from EUR 3m the year before with an average realised gross profit margin of 24% in line with historical levels.

At its core, Taaleri seizes transformational opportunities powered by megatrends in private capital and focuses on building profitable growth through its three business segments. The company leverages expertise and capital to power long-term returns. Taaleri’s strategic focus areas are: Capturing Garantia’s full growth potential. Expansion of the private asset management business by scaling products within its current strategies and launching new products. Attractive return on direct investments through development capital. Implementing the growth strategy also through selective M&A. According to the clarified strategy, the non-life insurance company Garantia seeks to increase its market share in both mortgage guarantees and corporate guarantees, with an objective to generate stable cash flow that enables faster growth in Taaleri’s Private Asset Management and Investment operations. In the Private Asset Management business, Taaleri will focus on the growth of its existing renewable energy, bioindustry, and real estate strategies, as well as the selective launch of new funds. Through direct investments, Taaleri provides development capital to companies and situations where an ownership structure and investment horizon that deviates from the traditional private equity fund model allow for more effective value creation. “We power change through capital both in our investments and society at large. The updated financial targets reflect our commitment to profitable growth across all our businesses. We expect Garantia to continue its stable performance as the housing market recovers, gradually expand its partner network and markets, and bring more stability and predictability to our earnings model. In Private Asset Management, we focus on scaling operations by increasing fund sizes in our current strategies and selectively expanding our offering with new products. Additionally, we will leverage our own balance sheet by allocating capital to both existing direct investments and potential new targets,” says Taaleri CEO Ilkka Laurila. Long-term financial targets With the clarified strategy, Taaleri has set updated financial targets for 2026–2028. These targets reflect Taaleri’s commitment to profitable growth and value creation for its shareholders by 2028. Taaleri’s updated financial targets for 2026–2028 are: Profitability growth: Growth in operating profit from continuing earnings 12% p.a. on average (new target) Return on equity (ROE) at fair value: Above 15% p.a. on average over the strategy period (updated) Dividend policy: At least 50% of the financial year’s profit to be paid as dividends (unchanged) Quarterly operating profit from continuing earnings from the periods 1 January–31 December 2024 and 1 January–30 June 2025 is available as an appendix to this stock exchange release. Previously, Taaleri aimed for growth of at least 15% in continuing earnings and performance fees. The return on equity target level remains unchanged, although going forward, the target considers the fair value of assets through comprehensive income for the financial year. Previously, only net profit was considered. The implementation of the dividend policy will take into account potential capital requirements. “For nearly two decades, we have successfully leveraged prevailing megatrends to identify new investment opportunities. Our business model and strong expertise provide a solid foundation for profitable growth in the future. Taaleri also has a strong track record of successful acquisitions and divestments, and we remain open to M&A opportunities going forward,” Laurila adds. Capital Markets Day on 2 September 2025 Taaleri will host a Capital Markets Day on 2 September 2025 to present the company’s strategy and financial outlook. The event can be followed via a live webcast starting at 13:00 (EEST) at . A recording of the webcast and presentation materials will be available afterward at .

Upward revision of 2025 net result forecast from DKK 41-43 million to DKK 52-54 million for the year 2025 CeMat obtained a new binding individual zoning decision for a residential development on a 7,022 sqm plot. This plot is part of a larger 21,648 sqm site for the next phase of “Moje Bielany”. According to the new zoning decision and initial analyses, the site has the potential to accommodate between 108–111 residential units, with a total usable area ranging from 5,400 to 5,556 sqm. Based on the newly issued individual zoning decision, the Cushman & Wakefield report gave the re-zoned property an “as is” fair value of DKK 21.2 million (2024 report: DKK 7.9 million). As a result of this increase in property value, an additional DKK 13.3 million will be recognised in the company’s financial results for 2025. This positive impact includes revaluation of plot for the next phase of “Moje Bielany” (DKK 13.2 million) and part of a road plot (DKK 0.1 million). The new decision and the resulting property valuation will have a positive impact on the Company’s results for 2025. Accordingly, CeMat is upgrading the forecasts previously presented in the H1 report. The Company now expects a positive net result of DKK 52-54 million for 2025, compared to the DKK 41-43 million announced in the H1 2025 report. All other aspects of the financial outlook for 2025 remain unchanged relative to the H1 report: Consolidated EBITDA for the CeMat Group has been upgraded and is expected to be DKK 37–39 million in 2025; EBITDA from the development segment is expected to be DKK 30–32 million in 2025, out of the total result of DKK 37–39 million predicted for residential project “Moje Bielany 1” EBITDA from the property rental business is projected to reach DKK 6.5–7 million; This positive net result of DKK 52–54 million is the figure before any changes in valuation for the remaining investment property are taken into account. It should be emphasized that this is the third planning decision obtained in 2025. In addition to the current ‘Moje Bielany 1’ project, the Company’s development pipeline comprises 235–238 residential units as well as a self-storage facility, all scheduled for completion by the end of 2028. Thanks to the issued decision, we are also updating the company’s portfolio for the years 2025–2028: [SEE IMAGE OF THE PORTFOLIO IN THE ATTACHED ANNOUNCEMENT] Please note that the valuation of the investment property could change the result significantly because the market value depends on many factors, some of which are outside the company’s control.

The decision requires Ojos del Salado to implement remediation activities on the impacted area, including but not limited to the backfilling of the sinkhole, the facilitation of recharging the aquifer, ongoing monitoring requirements and the transfer of certain ground water rights. In addition, Ojos del Salado is required to implement water infrastructure projects to strengthen rural potable water and wastewater systems in communities surrounding the mine. Throughout the process the Company has collaborated with investigative proceedings initiated by sectoral regulators, including providing monitoring technology, studies and experts to provide information and ensure the stability of the sinkhole. The Company will work with authorities and stakeholders to clarify details and timelines of the remediation activities included in the decision while it determines its next steps. Mining operations at Alcaparrosa have been suspended since the sinkhole incident occurred in July 2022. At the time, Mineral Reserve estimates for the Alcaparrosa mine were removed from the Company’s reserve statement and have not been included in any future production estimates. The Company’s Candelaria operation is unaffected and is forecast to produce 140,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes of copper in 2025.

Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) today announced a change to its commercial operating model, aimed at focusing resources and capital on the highest-growth opportunities while ensuring continued patient access to our medicines. As a next step in the continued execution of its Focused Innovator strategy, Lundbeck will transition its operations to a partnership model in 27 markets in Europe & International Operations through new partnerships with Swixx Group, Zuellig Pharma, and NewBridge Pharmaceuticals. The partnership model will ensure continued access to Lundbeck’s medicines through trusted regional partners, while Lundbeck will discontinue its commercial organizations in the countries in scope. In addition, Lundbeck will transition the majority of its current partner markets into the new partnerships with Swixx Group, Zuellig Pharma, and NewBridge Pharmaceuticals. The phased transition to the partnership model is expected to be completed by 1 December, 2025 in all countries. “This step is essential to building the commercial infrastructure that will sustain our long-term strategy and deepen our commitment to serving patients. By reducing complexity and shifting resources to the markets and brands with the greatest growth potential, we are focusing capital to accelerate progress on our strategic priorities – most notably our growing late-stage pipeline in neuro-rare and neuro-specialty diseases,” said Charl van Zyl, President and CEO of Lundbeck. “We are honored to be selected by Lundbeck as a key multi-regional partner. The alliance recognizes both our capabilities and track record whilst leveraging (and augmenting) our deep presence in emerging markets. We are committed to keeping faith with Lundbeck’s trust - to ensure uninterrupted access to Lundbeck’s portfolio and to serve patients across the contracted territories,” said Jean-Michel Lespinasse, CEO of Swixx Group. “As a trusted partner for distribution and commercialization in Asia, we are committed to enhancing access to Lundbeck’s portfolio of leading brands for patients who need them most. We will work closely with Lundbeck throughout this transition, tapping on our deep local expertise to ensure continuity of care and improve access to innovative brain health solutions for the region,” said John Graham, CEO of Zuellig Pharma. “We are very proud to be the strategic partner for Lundbeck in the Middle East and North Africa. Our strong regional footprint and local expertise will ensure continued access for patients to Lundbeck’s portfolio of products. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to improving brain health and continuing to address unmet needs in neuro-psychiatry diseases in the MENA region,” said Joe Henein, President & CEO, NewBridge Pharmaceuticals. This transition is expected to be margin accretive, supporting Lundbeck in freeing up capital to allow targeted investments in support of our goal of building neuro-rare and neuro-specialty disease franchises while reducing operational complexity at the same time. While the implementation of the partnership model is expected to incur one-off costs of approximately DKK 390 million in 2025, the optimization of Lundbeck’s commercial model has no impact on its financial guidance for 2025 or the mid-term targets provided at the Capital Markets Event in October 2024. Lundbeck has conducted a rigorous analysis of how it currently deploys resources across markets, which showed that Lundbeck cannot optimally serve all patients in all markets itself without spreading its resources too thin. The selected partners have strong regional expertise and infrastructure to continue to maintain and expand access to Lundbeck’s medicines for patients. The currently marketed portfolio of Lundbeck products will continue to be available in the impacted countries, and during the transition phase, Lundbeck and the new partners will prioritize upholding business continuity to ensure that patients will continue to have access to Lundbeck’s medicines. “I would like to thank all our employees in the countries in scope, whose outstanding work has allowed us to build strong foundations in the region. We are fully committed to supporting colleagues through this change, and I am confident they will continue to carry forward the professionalism and dedication to improving the lives of patients they have demonstrated at Lundbeck,” said Charl van Zyl, President and CEO of Lundbeck. Lundbeck currently has 602 employees in the commercial organizations in the countries in scope. The majority of these in-country employees are expected to have the opportunity to get a new job with the local partners, who highly value their knowledge and experience. Contract terms and financial implications * Under the partnership agreements, the new partners will assume responsibility for the sales, marketing, access, and distribution of Lundbeck’s medicines in the markets included. * Lundbeck will continue to supply products to all affected markets, and partners will receive a margin on in-market sales. Lundbeck will recognize revenue reflecting in-market sales, minus the partner margin. * The scope of the partnerships initially covers Lundbeck’s full in-market portfolio. * The partnership agreements are open-ended multi-year contracts, with customary exit provisions. * In 2024, the future partner markets accounted for DKK 2,677 million in revenue (12% of group revenue) with total SG&A costs of 628 million (5% of group SG&A costs). * The 27 affiliate markets involved are: * Transitioning into the partnership with Swixx Group: Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Panama, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine. * Transitioning into the partnership with Zuellig Pharma: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore. * Transitioning into the partnership with NewBridge Pharmaceuticals: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates. * In addition, Lundbeck will transition the majority of its current partner markets into the new partnerships. * Following the implementation of the three regional partnerships, Lundbeck will retain in-country commercial operations in the following markets: * Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China & Hong Kong, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States Contacts Marie Petterson Jens Høyer Head of Media Relations Vice President, Head of Investor Relations +45 29 82 21 82 +45 30 83 45 01 About H.

The total consideration amounts to approximately SEK 27 million (USD 2.85 million) and will be paid in cash at closing. Transaction background and closing The transaction is part of Albert Group’s strategic review announced in June 2025. Together with the previously communicated cost savings programme of SEK 25 million on an annual basis, the divestment supports Albert’s financial targets of reaching positive EBITDA during 2025 and cash-flow break-even during 2026, funded by our own resources. The purchase price amounts to approximately SEK 27 million (USD 2.85 million) and will be paid in cash. Completion of the transaction is expected during the second half of September. BirdBrain Technologies, Inc. will acquire key assets in Strawbees consisting of primarily intellectual property pertaining to the Strawbees business and all inventory. Consequently, following closing of the transaction, Albert Group will close all Strawbees related business. Financial impact on the Albert Group The divestment, once completed, will strengthen Albert Group’s cash position and remove recurring losses of approximately SEK 1 million per month related to Strawbees. Non-recurring items related to the transaction will be reported in the company’s interim financial report for the third quarter of 2025. The transaction delivers a cash inflow of approximately SEK 27 million and an estimated positive net balance sheet effect of approximately SEK 4 million. The Q3 result will include a non-recurring, non-cash impairment to align carrying values with the consideration. Comment from Fredrik Bengtsson, CEO of Albert Group: “I’m grateful to the Strawbees team for their creativity and commitment in building a globally relevant STEM brand, and to have found a strong industrial home for it in BirdBrain. Divesting key assets in Strawbees is a decisive step in executing our strategy to sharpen Albert Group’s focus. By simplifying the portfolio and strengthening our balance sheet, we can now put all our weight behind our subscription brands and fund that growth from our own resources. Our execution is accelerating and our focus is crystal clear: profitable and sustainable growth.” For additional information, please contact: Fredrik Bengtsson, CEO Mobile: +46 (0) 723 28 01 44 Email: This information is information that eEducation Albert is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.

The sanction is related to a case in the summer of 2022, which S-Bank has already announced earlier and which the bank has investigated in cooperation with the authority. In the case, suspected criminals exploited an exceptional and very difficult-to-detect malfunction found in the software of S-Bank's system provider. The abuse targeted a small number of S-Bank’s customers. The system malfunction was corrected as soon as it was detected. Immediate measures were taken to protect customer data and minimise damage.

As part of the transformation, Novo Nordisk intends to reduce the global workforce by approximately 9,000 of the 78,400 positions in the company, with around 5,000 reductions expected in Denmark. The transformation reflects the Company’s commitment to meet rising global demand while also competing in a more dynamic and consumer-driven obesity market, as evidenced by the recent slowdown in growth. Over the past years, Novo Nordisk’s rapid scaling has increased organisational complexity and costs. The transformation aims at addressing that complexity, so Novo Nordisk can invest more behind its science, commercial capabilities and manufacturing ramp-up – aiming to reach the millions of people who remain untreated. Mike Doustdar, Novo Nordisk president and CEO, said: “As the global leader in obesity and diabetes, Novo Nordisk delivers life-changing products for patients worldwide. But our markets are evolving, particularly in obesity, as it has become more competitive and consumer- driven. Our company must evolve as well. This means instilling an increased performance-based culture, deploying our resources ever more effectively, and prioritising investment where it will have the most impact – behind our leading therapy areas.” Investment priorities, timing and further initiatives The workforce reduction is expected across the Company, including staff areas and headquarters functions, and is expected to deliver total annualised savings of around DKK 8 billion by the end of 2026. The savings will be redirected to growth opportunities in diabetes and obesity, including commercial execution initiatives and R&D programmes. The implementation will begin immediately, and the Company expects to communicate with affected employees over the next few months, pending negotiations as per local legal labour market requirements. Further, additional initiatives are to be implemented to enhance organisational focus, performance culture and speed of decision-making as well as cost efficiencies. Novo Nordisk President and CEO Mike Doustdar added: “It is always difficult to see talented and valued colleagues go, but we are convinced that this is the right thing to do for the long-term success of Novo Nordisk. We need a shift in our mindset and approach so we can be faster and more agile. Our transformation plan is designed to deliver this. By realigning our resources now, we will be able to prioritise investments to drive sustainable growth and future innovation for the millions of patients with chronic diseases globally, particularly in diabetes and obesity.” One-off financial implications The company-wide transformation comes with an expected DKK 8 billion in net one-off restructuring costs, including impairment charges. Restructuring costs of around DKK 9 billion will be incurred in the third quarter of 2025, countered by savings of around DKK 1 billion in the fourth quarter. Consequently, Novo Nordisk expects an estimated one-off negative impact of around 6 percentage points on full-year operating profit growth at CER in 2025 compared to the operating profit outlook issued 6 August. Outlook 2025 Expectations 10 September Expectations 6 August Operating profit growth (EBIT) at CER 4-10% 10-16% Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses Around DKK 21 billion Around DKK 17 billion This change in expectations for 2025 only factors in the one-off restructuring costs described above. The forward-looking statements section on page 26 in the Financial report for the first six months of 2025 (Company Announcement No 20/2025) also apply to this company announcement. Novo Nordisk’s disclosure of the financial results for the first nine months of 2025 and financial outlook for 2025 will be published on 5 November. Novo Nordisk is a leading global healthcare company founded in 1923 and headquartered in Denmark. Our purpose is to drive change to defeat serious chronic diseases built upon our heritage in diabetes. We do so by pioneering scientific breakthroughs, expanding access to our medicines and working to prevent and ultimately cure disease.

Outlook for the financial year 2025 Puuilo reiterates the outlook for the financial year 2025 provided in its financial statements release on 27 March 2025 and reiterated in its Q1 business review on 10 June 2025. The company forecasts that net sales will be €425 – 455 million and the adjusted EBITA will be €70 – 80 million in the financial year 2025. The forecast includes elements of uncertainty related to changes in consumer purchasing power and behaviour. Additionally, geopolitical crises and international tensions may affect product availability and prices. Puuilo’s long-term targets The company’s long-term financial targets for the strategy period 2024 – 2028: Growth: Net sales above €600 million by the end of financial year 2028 (ends in January 2029) Profitability: Adjusted EBITA margin above 17% of net sales Profit distribution: The company aims to distribute at least 80% of net income for each financial year Leverage: Net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.0x Puuilo will publish the updated long-term targets for the strategy period 2026 – 2030 today, 11 September 2025. CEO Juha Saarela’s review Puuilo delivered a solid performance in Q2. Net sales growth was 13.2% (+14.9%) and a like-for-like growth was 1.3% (+2.1%). Customer traffic continued to grow. Across all stores, the growth was +14.6% and +2.8% in like-for-like stores. In Q2, the average basket size decreased by 1.2% (decrease of 2.8%) compared to last year. However, the rate of decrease in average basket size slowed down. We observe cautious optimism in the air regarding a potential stabilization in the average basket size towards the end of the year, supported by slightly improved figures in recent consumer confidence and other economic indicators. In Puuilo’s case, the decline in average basket size may also be influenced by increased brand awareness and, to some extent, the expansion of our store network, which encourages customers to visit our stores more frequently as accessibility improves through new store openings. In Q2, Puuilo’s adjusted EBITA was €28.2 million (€24.8 million), which reflects an increase of 13.7% compared to last year. The EBITA increase was driven by strong net sales development, effective cost control, and an improved gross margin. In Q2, the Group’s gross margin was 38.2% (37.6%) increasing by 0.6 percentage points compared to previous year. The positive development in gross margin was particularly supported by the strong growth in net sales of private label products. Operating cash flow in Q2 was strong, amounting to €38.1 million (€31.7 million). The solid cash flow was supported by strong EBITA. Growth continues. During the past quarter, we opened two new stores: Mäntsälä in May and Jyväskylä Keljo in June. The latter is the second store in Jyväskylä. As usual, the openings went smoothly and attracted plenty of customers. Later in the financial year, we will open new stores in Iisalmi and Heinola. This brings the total number of new store openings for the year to seven. The opening calendar for the financial year 2026 is also nearly full. We have already announced new stores in Espoonlahti and Hollola. In addition, Vantaa Virkamies store will be relocated to Vantaa Tammisto. More news regarding 2026 store openings is still to come. Today, we will publish Puuilo’s strategy update and new financial targets extending through the financial year 2030. By the end of the strategy period, we are aiming for a network of at least 100 stores, annual average net sales growth of over 10%, and total net sales exceeding €800 million. Our profitability target is to achieve an adjusted EBITA margin of over 17%. Puuilo will start an organic international expansion by opening first pilot stores in Sweden during the strategy period. In doing so, we aim to ensure that Puuilo’s long-term growth continues. That said, because our concept has demonstrated strong performance also in smaller cities, we increased our target for the long-term potential in Finland to over 90 stores. Additionally, we will continue to focus on maintaining like-for-like growth, increasing the share of private label products, streamlining the customer experience, and advancing our sustainability agenda. Puuilo’s future and growth outlook remain strong. Finally, I want to thank our personnel, customers and shareholders! Significant events after the end of the reporting period Flagging notification Puuilo has received a notification on 11 August 2025 in accordance with Chapter 9, Section 5 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.

The Group received one-off compensations for leasing argreements and capital gains from sold tangible assets in the last financial year, which has not previously recorded as an extraordinary item. Company description HLRE Holding Group (commonly known as Vesivek Group) is a leading provider of roof and roof product renovations, primarily offered to detached and row houses in Finland and Sweden under the Vesivek brand. In addition to roof and roof product installations, Vesivek provides underground drain renovations in eight locations in Finland. The Group also develops, manufactures, and sells high quality rainwater systems and roof safety products. HLRE Holding Group operates in 13 locations in Finland and three locations in Sweden and employing an average of approximately 700 employees. The Group has two production facilities in Finland, steel roofing profile production in Pirkkala and the production of rainwater systems and roof safety products in Orimattila. Management Overview of the second quarter The Group's revenue and gross profit improved in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Especially in Sweden the roof installation business performed very well. Revenue increase was 22% and gross profit increase 57%. In Finland roof installation and roof product sales grew compared to last year. Gross profit remained at previous year level due to the sales mix where sales were more focused on non-consumer projects with lower profitability. However, investments in revenue growth were reflected in increased fixed personnel costs and other fixed operating expenses. Due to that reason the adjusted EBITDA with EUR 0.6 million remained at previous year level. Despite revenue growth, sales volumes remained low in the second quarter, especially in the Finnish business areas. Q2 results fell short of our forecast. The Group has started negotiations in August to reduce fixed personnel costs in order to improve profitability towards the year end. Second quarter May - July 20245 Q2 revenue increased by 7 % to EUR 27.0 million (25.1 million). Revenue grew especially in roof installation business in Sweden. Gross profit was EUR 9.8 million (9.2 million). Q2 reported EBITDA was EUR 1.0 million (0.8 million) and adjusted EBITDA EUR 0.6 million (0.6 million). Despite the growth in revenue and gross profit, the adjusted EBITDA remained at previous year level due to higher fixed personnel and administrative expenses. The reported one-off items for Q2 May – July 2025 concern received capital gains from sold tangible assets (vehicles) amounted to EUR 0.4 million. Q2 operating cash flow was EUR 0.7 million (0.5 million). Cash flow increased due to the positive changes in working capital and lower net financial items. The change in cash and cash equivalents was EUR -0.1 million. First half 2025 H1 revenue increased by 7 % to EUR 48.8 EUR million (EUR 45.7 million). H1 gross profit increased to EUR 18.4 million (EUR 17.7 million). Revenue and gross profit grew especially in roof installation business in Sweden. H1 reported EBITDA decreased to EUR 0.8 million (1.1 million) and adjusted EBITDA to EUR 0.4 million (0.9 million). Reported adjustments in H1 amounted to EUR 0.4 and mainly concerned received capital gains from sold tangible assets (vehicles). H1 net cash from operating activities was EUR 1.2 million (EUR -2.6 million). Cash flow increased due to the positive changes in working capital, lower net financial items and lower paid taxes. The change in cash and cash equivalents was EUR -1.2 million due to the payments of lease liabilities and other borrowings. Outlook for the financial year 1 February 2025 – 31 January 2026 Market growth expectations for the installation business in Sweden are strong, and we expect growth in Swedish business to continue in the second half of the year. In Finland, on the contrary, market growth expectations will remain low. The Group has started negotiations in August to reduce fixed personnel costs in order to improve profitability towards the year end in Finnish roof installation business. We expect that the EBITDA will increase in H2 compared to the previous year level mainly due to the business growth in Sweden and cost saving operations in Finland. Risks and business continuity The Half Year Financial Report for the period of February 25 – July 25 has been prepared based on the going concern principle, assuming that the Company will have positive operating cash flow sufficient to meet it’s obligations as part of normal business operations in the foreseeable future. The Group's revenue and operating profit are affected by the general economic situation, which in turn is influenced by many factors beyond the Group's control. The Group currently operates in Finland and Sweden. Currently, most of the Group's operations are located in Finland. Accordingly, the Group's revenue and operating profit are particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and perceptions of future general economic situation in the Finnish and Swedish markets. Uncertainty or adverse developments in the general economic situation may affect the Group's business and demand for the Group's products and services, among other things, by affecting consumer confidence and adversely affecting the business of the Group's corporate customers who purchase the Group's rainwater systems and roof safety products. It is important to note that the general economic situation may adversely affect the level and cost of financing available to the Group's consumer and corporate clients to make investments in renovations and refurbishments. In addition, rising financing costs and a decrease in the level of available financing may adversely affect the Group's ability to make investments and achieve its strategic objectives, as well as adversely effect on the Group's business, financial position and results. Through its manufacturing operations, the Group is furthermore exposed to fluctuations in certain commodity prices (such as steel, aluminum and wood) and energy prices (especially through fuel costs for vehicles) and price increases due to economic disruptions and changes in general market conditions may adversely affect the Group's business, financial position and results. All the above factors may harm the Group's operations, and the Group cannot anticipate how the future economic environment and market conditions may affect the Group's operations. In general, the frequency of accidents at construction sites is noteworthy and the Group operates in a business segment subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding the work environment. Despite the required health and safety measures and, for example, the use of scaffolding to improve employee safety on construction sites, the Group is exposed to potentially fatal accidents at workplaces, particularly on roofing renovation sites, but also at its production facilities. In addition to physical injuries, the Group’s employees are exposed to risks related to hazardous substances, as some of the Group’s renovation sites contain asbestos. Respectively, the Group must also comply with specific environmental regulations with respect to asbestos. Finnish legislation has particularly strict requirements for any activities involving asbestos and the safety requirements for such activities. Failure to comply with the regulations concerning health and safety or asbestos related activities may result in liability for the Group and/or the Group’s permit being revoked. For example, if Group’s permit to handle asbestos would be revoked, the Group would need to stop all business activities relating to handling of asbestos and acquire the work through subcontractors. In addition, any potential accidents and health impacts adversely affect employee well-being. The Group as an employer is exposed to risks related to health and safety issues of its employees, which may lead to a decrease in employees’ ability to work. The Group’s management has prepared financial forecasts for revenue, expenses and investments, taking into account the refinancing of the bond and extensive efficiency measures. In assessing the going concern assumption, management believes that the company’s current liquid funds and projected operating cash flows will be sufficient to cover its liabilities and obligations arising from its operations for at least 12 months, so the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The forecasts assume a positive turn in the markets. In addition, the Group’s management has taken measures to improve the cash position by, for example, switching to the use of consignment stock for steel products. Due to general economic uncertainty, industry cyclicality, and the short time horizon of the order book, forecasting involves a higher degree of judgment than usual. If the business does not develop as forecasted, there is a risk of liquidity being compromised and covenants being breached, which may raise significant doubts about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Such factors would also affect the valuation of Group’s goodwill and the shares and receivables of the parent company’s subsidiaries at the balance sheet. The Finnish roof renovation and roof product installation business has not performed as planned in the first half year and EBITDA level has been lower than estimated. Finnish economy has not recovered as estimated in the beginning of the year. The Group went through the change negotiations in August, which resulted in a decrease of 70 person. Delays in recovery in Finnish roof renovation business will increase the risk that the Group will not meet covenant requirements at the end of the year 2025. The Group’s saving measures in August should improve financial results in the third quarter. The management will follow on monthly basis the business recovery and will prepare impairment tests in Q3 if saving measures are not efficient enough to convert Finnish roof renovation business performance.

for the Group, which consists of a Finnish public limited company operating under Finnish law, with business ID 2611405-7 (hereinafter “HLRE Holding”, “Company”, or “parent company”) and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as “HLRE”, “HLRE Group” or “Group”. The parent company’s domicile is Pirkkala, and its registered address is Jasperintie 273, FI-33960 Pirkkala, Finland. 2) Basis of preparation These consolidated Interim Financial Statements do not include all of the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and accordingly, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended January 31, 2025. The consolidated financial statements are presented as thousands of euros, unless otherwise specified, and the numbers are rounded off to the nearest thousand. Because of this, the sum of individual figures can deviate from the reported total. The company’s auditors have not reviewed this Interim Report. The management has assessed the Company's ability to continue its operations as a going concern for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Company's management has prepared forecasts for revenues, operating costs, and investments for the next twelve months. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the structural reorganization carried out in Finland in 2024 and continuing in 2025 has aligned the organization with demand. As of 31 July 2025, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 1.3 million. The management believes that the current cash balance is adequate to cover the Company's operational costs and investment plans for the next twelve months. Looking ahead, the Company anticipates the improved profitability and cash flow for the next quarter. Despite the inherent uncertainties, the management remains confident in the Company's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Taking into account the aforementioned factors and considerations, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management will continue to closely monitor the Company's financial performance and adapt its strategies as necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. 3) Seasonality of operations The Group operates in an industry that sees major seasonal changes. In a typical year, the second and third quarter together amount major share of the Group’s full-year EBITDA. Management has reacted to seasonal changes in customer volumes and demand for roof, roof product and underground drain renovations through workforce adjustment and structural changes in business area management and sales functions in Finland. 4) Segment information and revenue The Board of Directors of HLRE Holding is the Group’s chief operating decision maker, and operating segments have been specified based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors in order to allocate resources and assess the profitability of business operations. The Board of Directors manages the HLRE Group as a single integrated business aggregate, and therefore HLRE has a single operating and reportable segment. The revenue of the HLRE Holding Group is primarily generated by roofing, roof product and underground drain renovations for single-family homes and housing companies pursuant to the service concept developed by the Company, as well as project and direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products. The entire service chain – product development, manufacturing, sales and installation – is managed in-house by the Group. The HLRE Holding Group is operating in Finland and Sweden. Small-scale out of total H1 revenue was generated by direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products from Vesivek Tuotteet Oy in Finland to Baltic countries and Sweden. The Swedish turnover was generated by roofing and roof product installations and small-scale by direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products: Breakdown of revenue by country 1000 EUR Feb 25 – Jul 25 H1 Feb 24 – Jul 24 H1 Feb 24 – Jan 25 Q1-Q4 Finland 37 439 36 012 81 539 Sweden 11 023 9 381 20 797 Baltic countries 375 267 593 Total 48 837 45 660 102 929 5) Financial liabilities The Group announced in January 2024 that it had concluded the negotiations with the majority holder of the bond on the terms and conditions for refinancing the bond, while at the same time announcing that, as the maturity of the outstanding bonds, being 12 February 2024, was approaching, it will request for a one-month extension to finalize the terms and conditions. On 5 February 2024, the Group announced that the majority of the bondholders had approved the one-month extension. In February 2024, the Group continued to finalize the terms and conditions of the bond, announcing on 8 March 2024 the refinancing of the three-year SEK 300 million bond and the registration of the bond with Nasdaq Stockholm on 13 March 2024. The bond falls due for payment on 12 February 2027. The terms and conditions include an interest premium of 7.85% for the deferral of the payment dates between 12 February 2024 and 12 May 2025 until the loan maturity date. The updated terms and conditions also include the option after 12 May 2025 to postpone 30% of the 7.85% interest premium until the loan maturity date. The Group used the option and postponed 30 % of the interest premium during 12 May 2025 – 12 August 2025. In addition, the terms and conditions of the bond included a five-year convertible bond of EUR 3 million issued by the Company’s principal shareholders and around EUR 66 thousand to minor shareholders. The principal of the convertible bond is subject to a fixed annual interest rate of 8.00%. The accrued interest shall be paid on the maturity date of the loan or on the conversion date specified separately in the agreement, whichever earlier. Until then, all accrued interest will remain as debt, but the accrued interest will not be added to the loan principal and will not accrue interest. The updated terms and conditions of the bond do not include the net debt/EBITDA covenant until 2025 July. After that, the covenant will be 5.0 until January 2026, 4.5 between February 2026 and July 2026, and 4.0 from August 2026 until the loan maturity date in February 2027. The updated terms and conditions also include a liquidity covenant of EUR 2 million.

Furthermore, the following internal loans have been pledged as collateral for the bond agreement: Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to HLRE Group Ltd amounted to EUR 19,696,333 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Vesivek Ltd amounted to EUR 1,234,960 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Nesco Invest Ltd amounted to EUR 8,446.710 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd amounted to EUR 4,510,442 The following business mortgages have been confirmed and pledged as collateral for the bond and overdraft facility: HLRE Group Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Nesco Invest Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Sverige AB amounted to SEK 20 000 000 The following real estate mortgages have been pledged as collateral for the bond and overdraft facility: Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, Orimattila production plant, amounted to EUR 13 673 208. 7) Use of Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance Measures (APM) are financial measures of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than financial measures defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework. HLRE Group reports the financial measures [Gross profit], [Gross margin] and [Adjusted EBITDA] in its quarterly reports, which are not financial measures as defined in IFRS. The Group believes that the alternative performance measures provide significant additional information on HLRE’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows The APMs are used consistently over time and accompanied by comparatives for the previous periods. Gross profit= Revenues – cost of goods sold Gross margin (%) = Gross profit in relation to Revenue EBITDA = Operating profit (EBIT) + Depreciation + Amortization EBITDA % = EBITDA in relation to Revenue Adjusted EBITDA = EBITDA - EBITDA Adjustments Adjusted EBITDA % = (EBITDA - EBITDA Adjustments) / Revenue Operating profit (EBIT) % = Operating profit in relation to Revenue EBITDA adjustments = One-offs regarding restructuring costs and other non-recurring costs 8) Events after the Reporting Date The Group announced in August (4.8.2025) that it will restructure its organization and operational processes and will initiate change negotiations. In addition to changes in operating practices, the aim of the negotiations is to reduce management layers and enhance the efficiency of the sales organizations in Finland. The negotiations took place in August, started on 11 August 2025 and ended on 18 August 2025, and concerned all personnel of HLRE Group Ltd, Vesivek Ltd, and Vesivek Salaojat Ltd, excluding installers and foremen. Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, Tuusulan Peltikeskus Ltd, and Vesivek Sverige AB were entirely excluded from the change negotiations. As a result of the change negotiations, the number of personnel will decrease by 60 employees. Together with other changes in personnel in August, the amount of employees will decrease by 71 employees from July 2025 head count. The personnel changes are estimated to generate annual savings of EUR 5.0 million. The estimated one-off expenses from the change negotiations is estimated to be EUR 0.4 million and the expenses will be booked in the Q3 Interim Report. These measures are a response to the decline in market demand in recent years and, together with the company’s previous actions, aim to restore financial profitability.

The Composite product group generated revenue growth, while the FOC product group’s revenue declined. Operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items for Q1-Q3 2024/25 was DKKm 43.7 (DKKm 25.8) 1 and operating profit (EBIT) before special items was DKKm 33.3 (DKKm 13.7). Both revenue and earnings were realised at the upper end of the previously guided range for the first nine months of 2024/25. The improved earnings were due to a favourable product mix and realised productivity enhancements resulting from investments in production and ongoing optimisation of operations. For Q1-Q3 2024/25, the Group posted a profit from continuing operations before tax of DKKm 28.7 (DKKm 12.9). In Company Announcement no. 8 dated 24 July 2025, the Company stated that the divestment of Roblon’s US subsidiary had been completed. The effects of this on Roblon’s interim financial statements for the first nine months are as follows: A loss of DKKm 33.1 was recognised in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period, DKKm 5.4 of which related to advisory fees. An accumulated translation reserve of DKKm -10.2 concerning the divested US subsidiary was reclassified from equity and recognised as a loss in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period. Roblon’s receivable from the divested US subsidiary was written down from approx. USDm 12.5 to USDm 5.2 and included in Roblon’s non-current receivable in the amount of DKKm 33.7 at 31 July 2025. Roblon has retained ownership of one share with special dividend rights in the divested US subsidiary. The value of the share is recognised at DKKm 0 in Roblon’s balance sheet at 31 July 2025. At 31 July 2025, consolidated equity was reduced to DKKm 176.6 and the solvency ratio was reduced by 3.4 percentage points to 71.6% due to the value adjustment of the US subsidiary following the divestment. Roblon has no further liquidity obligations towards the divested US subsidiary. Guidance for 2024/25 Management’s previously announced guidance was that the Company’s revenue and earnings for Q4 would be at a lower level than in Q4 2023/24. This guidance is maintained, based on the lower order book at 31 July 2025 compared with 31 July 2024. Management maintains its most recent full-year guidance announced in Roblon’s interim report for H1 2024/25, although the guided ranges are narrowed as follows: revenue in the range of DKKm 230-250 against the previously guided range of DKKm 220-250 operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items in the range of DKKm 45-50 against the previously guided range of DKKm 40-50 operating profit (EBIT) before special items in the range of DKKm 31-36 against the previously guided range of DKKm 26-36 1 In the interim report, realised amounts for the previous year are stated in brackets.

Although elevated geopolitical risks increase customers’ need to invest in preparedness, they have also slowed down customers’ decision-making, especially regarding larger orders. Additionally, the Kuwait soil remediation project has progressed more slowly than anticipated. Regarding profitability, the company maintains its previous guidance. On 31 July 2025, the company announced it would accelerate efficiency measures aimed at achieving annual cost savings of EUR 8 million by the end of 2026 compared to the 2024 level. Improved margins and strategic efficiency initiatives will support profitability growth. New guidance for 2025 Revenue is expected to decrease compared to the previous year (2024: EUR 114.4 million). Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase compared to the previous year (2024: EUR 6.4 million). Updated assumptions The guidance is based on the existing order backlog, known tenders and offers submitted, and the management's view on market demand and customer decision-making timeline. The company is currently negotiating several significant equipment sales and medium-sized service contracts in all its market areas. Revenue is expected to be clearly below the comparison period during the third quarter of the year and exceed it clearly during the final quarter. Full year revenue will depend on the accumulation of new orders and delivery schedules during the rest of the year. Revenue from the continuing large service project in Kuwait is expected to be clearly lower compared to the previous year, while the growth of other revenue outside of large service projects is expected to continue. For plastic recycling no revenue is expected during 2025. The company estimates that improved margins and strategic efficiency initiatives will support profitability growth. Driven by the level of revenue, operating profit is expected to be below the comparison period in the third quarter and exceed it in the fourth quarter.

As of June 30, 2025, Toivo Group Plc (the “Company”) had a total of approximately EUR 17.1 million in capital loans recorded under equity on its balance sheet. These capital loans are classified as equity because they are repaid only at the discretion of the Company. Today, the Company’s Board of Directors has decided to repay part of the principal and accrued interest of capital loans to companies owned by members of the Company’s management team, which are classified as related parties, as well as to two other companies whose owners are employed by the Company. The repayment will be made in accordance with the terms of the capital loans and using the Company’s available cash resources. The related parties include CFO Samuli Niemelä, whose company will receive EUR 65,461.51, and Deputy CEO Urho Myllymäki, whose company will receive EUR 118,682.24. The total amount to be paid to the other parties is EUR 99,797.57. The payments will be executed within two banking days following the publication of this release. As some of the repayments are directed to related parties, this constitutes a related party transaction under the Finnish Companies Act. The Company’s Board of Directors has assessed that the transaction is ordinary for the Company and its terms are in line with market conditions. The repayment will not affect the Company’s liquidity or the financial guidance issued for 2025.

This newsletter aims to inform capital market participants of the key factors influencing the company's recent financial performance. Insurance revenue growth Tryg maintains a balanced distribution of insurance revenue across the Scandinavian countries, with approximately 50% of revenue generated in Denmark, 30% in Sweden, and 20% in Norway. In Q3 2024, Tryg reported insurance revenue of DKK 9,786m. In general, the group revenue development remains in line with recent development. Tryg reported a growth measured in local currencies of 4.0% in Q2 2025. In Q3 2024 a positive one-off of approximately DKK 50m was included in the insurance revenue. When converting earnings from local currencies to DKK, Tryg’s reporting currency, the expected average value of SEK 100 is DKK 67.1 (65.2 Q3 2024), and NOK 100 is DKK 63.3 (64.2 Q3 2024). Claims environment Underlying claims development Tryg operates a stable business and recent trends in underlying performance should thus be considered reliable indicators for short-term trends. The Group's underlying claims ratio was 67.3% in Q3 2024. At the capital markets day (CMD) on 4 December 2024, Tryg mentioned that it expects a broadly stable to slightly improving underlying performance in the new strategy period towards 2027. In Q1 2025 and Q2 2025, the Group underlying claims ratio improved 30 basis points and in Q1 2025 the Private underlying claims ratio improved 10 basis points and in Q2 2025 the Private underlying claims ratio improved 20 basis points. Weather and large claims For Q3, normalised weather claims amount to 20% of the annual DKK 800m guidance, equating to DKK 160m. As a reminder, the annual expectation for weather claims is split as follows (in percentages terms): 40% in Q1, 10% in Q2, 20% in Q3 and 30% in Q4. On an annual basis, Tryg provides guidance for large claims amounting to DKK 800m, evenly distributed across quarters. Occasionally, information about large claims may be available in mass media or local press. At the time of writing, the sum of weather and large claims expectations remains broadly in line with the guidance for the third quarter of the year. Interest rates development For Q3, it is expected an approximate discount rate of 2.4%. The discounting percentage was reported at 2.4% in Q2 2025. Run-off expectations towards 2027 At the 2024 CMD, Tryg stated a long-term run-off expectation of ~2% towards 2027. Investment activities Tryg has divided its investment activities into a match portfolio (approx. DKK 45bn at Q2 2025) and a free portfolio (approx. DKK 15bn as per Q2 2025). As announced at the 2024 CMD, the free portfolio was derisked during Q4 2024 and now mainly consists of Scandinavian covered bonds and government bonds (approx. DKK 12bn) and the real estate portfolio (approx. DKK 3bn). The return on bonds can be modelled with the following Bloomberg tickers, 50% NYKRCMB2 and 50% NYKRCMG2. For the real estate portfolio, a normalised annual return of 6.5% is assumed. The return of the match portfolio mainly consists of the return on premium provisions, which is expected at DKK 65m per quarter with the current level of interest rates. Additionally, the line ‘Other financial income and expenses’ is guided at DKK -90m per quarter and mainly consists of costs related to currency hedges, general balance sheet items and costs related to running the investment operation. Other income and costs Other income and costs are originally guided between DKK -350m and DKK -370m on a quarterly basis. This is primarily driven by amortisation of intangibles related to the RSA Scandinavia acquisition. The intangibles are booked in SEK and converted to DKK (the reporting currency of Tryg). The SEK strengthening experienced this year (while positive for the insurance service result and thus the overall Group result) impacts this line negatively, and therefore an additional FX-related impact of approx. DKK 15m should be added to the original guidance. Number of shares At the end of Q2 2025, Tryg reported 603,076 outstanding shares. No material changes to the number of outstanding shares are expected. Outlook statement from annual report 2024 Tryg reported an insurance service result, adjusted for the more favorable-than-normal large and weather claims outcome, of around DKK 7.2bn in 2024 and it is now targeting its highest ever insurance service result of DKK 8.0-8.4bn in 2027. The insurance service result is expected to increase gradually throughout the strategy period. As announced in the newsletter dated March 2025, please note that 2024 financials have been restated due to changed inflation hedging.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that C3.ai and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm urges investors in C3.ai who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. C3.ai, Inc. (AI) Securities Class Action: According to the complaint, filed under the caption Liggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuit alleges that these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive. The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%. The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later than October 21, 2025. “We’re focused on whether C3.ai’s public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health was affecting the company’s ability to close deals and meet financial targets,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

The suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, comes after a dramatic stock price decline in August following the company’s earnings report. Video: The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. - Class Period: May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 27, 2025 - Contact the Firm Now: - Phone: 844-916-0895 - Email: - Website Form: LifeMD, Inc. (LFMD) Securities Class Action: The lawsuit, captioned Johnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7 and August 5, 2025. It alleges that LifeMD made false and misleading statements, particularly on May 6, 2025, when it reported its first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The complaint claims that the company’s optimistic outlook, which cited a “category-defining competitive moat” in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand, was false as it misleadingly failed to account for crucial business challenges. The suit contends that LifeMD was experiencing rising customer acquisition costs in its RexMD segment and a higher-than-anticipated refund rate in its weight management business, issues that it did not disclose to investors at the time. The alleged deception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings per share estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance.

(KBR) Faces Securities Class Action Amid TRANSCOM Contract Termination–Hagens Berman","SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new class-action lawsuit is targeting KBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR), alleging the company made misleading statements to investors in the weeks leading up to the abrupt cancellation of a major military contract. The suit, Norrman v. KBR, Inc., et al., No. 4:25-cv-04464 (S.D. Tex.), was filed after the company’s stock plunged following the termination of a multi-billion-dollar deal. National shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman urges KBR investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: May 6, 2025 – June 19, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Nov. 18, 2025 Visit: Contact the Firm Now: 844-916-0895 KBR, Inc. (KBR) Securities Class Action: The legal action seeks to represent shareholders who purchased KBR securities between May 6, 2025, and June 19, 2025. It claims that KBR executives provided a falsely optimistic outlook on a crucial partnership just as it was on the verge of collapse. The litigation stems from the Department of Defense U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) canceling its global household goods contract with HomeSafe Alliance LLC, a joint venture led by KBR. The decision, announced on June 20, 2025, caused KBR shares to fall over 7% as investors reacted to the loss of a contract valued at up to $20 billion over a potential nine-year term. The suit highlights a key discrepancy: on May 6, 2025, during its Q1 earnings call, KBR assured investors that the HomeSafe partnership was ""strong"" and ""excellent"" and that the company was ""very confident in the future of this program."" However, just weeks later, on June 19, 2025, HomeSafe disclosed that TRANSCOM had terminated the contract for cause. The termination reportedly came after months of operational issues, including chronic delays, missed pickups, and a rise in complaints about damaged goods. The complaint alleges that KBR was aware of TRANSCOM’s material concerns but chose to conceal them from investors. The lawsuit argues that this misrepresentation led to the significant financial losses suffered by shareholders. “We’re focused on whether KBR may have intentionally misled investors about the true status of the relationship with TRANSCOM and the contract,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Jos tämä oli tarkoituksella näin, sitten on enkkukin ok. HKFoods sold its Baltic operations to Estonian AS Maag Grupp on 31 August 2023. The debt-free purchase price was EUR 90 million, of which EUR 20 million is conditional on the combined performance of the separately defined meat business subject to the transaction and Maag Grupp's Baltic meat business over the next three years. Of the EUR 70 million fixed purchase price, EUR 55 million was paid at the closing of the transaction and the remainder in 2024 and 2025. As announced in HKFoods' Half Year Financial Report published on 6 August 2025, the fair value of the conditional purchase price was determined to be EUR 6.9 million at the end of June 2025. At the end of August 2025, African swine fever (ASF) was detected in Maag Grupp AS's largest pork production unit. The animal disease outbreak is expected to have a significant and long-term negative impact on the company’s performance, which is the basis for calculating the conditional purchase price. HKFoods’ management now estimates that the receipt of the conditional purchase price will not materialise, for which reason a write-down of EUR 6.9 million will be made in the third quarter of 2025. After the write-down, there will be no conditional purchase price receivable on the Group's balance sheet. The write-down will not affect the comparable EBIT and will have no impact on cash flow. The write-down will be reported as a result of discontinued operations.

Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 - Transaction volume was 11,606 units for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 40.4% from 8,264 units in the last quarter and an increase of 107.1% from 5,605 units in the same period last year. - Retail transaction volume was 10,385 units for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 37.6% from 7,545 units in the last quarter and an increase of 153.9% from 4,090 units in the same period last year. - Total revenues were RMB658.3 million (US$91.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 30.6% from RMB504.2 million in the last quarter and an increase of 64.1% from RMB401.2 million in the same period last year. - Gross margin was 5.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with 7.0% in the last quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. - Loss from operations was RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB35.3 million in the last quarter and RMB62.5 million in the same period last year. - Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA [1] was a loss of RMB16.5 million (US$2.3 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with a loss of RMB8.9 million in the last quarter and a loss of RMB33.9 million in the same period last year. Mr. Kun Dai, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Uxin, commented, ""Our business sustained its strong growth momentum in the second quarter of 2025, with retail transaction volume reaching 10,385 units, representing a 154% year-over-year increase and marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth above 140%. Importantly, we have also maintained healthy operating efficiency, with inventory turnover days stable at around 30, and customer satisfaction, as measured by NPS (net promoter score), at an industry-leading 65. Reflecting this strength, we now expect retail transaction volume growth of over 125% year-over-year in the third quarter. Accordingly, we are raising our full-year 2025 growth guidance to approximately 130% compared to calendar year 2024."" Mr. Dai continued, ""Since opening in February, our Wuhan superstore has performed ahead of expectations, achieving monthly sales of about 1,400 units with steadily improving profitability. At the same time, the expansion of our new superstores is progressing on schedule, with our Zhengzhou superstore officially commencing operations on September 27. We believe that the continued ramp-up of newly launched superstores, together with the sales momentum at our existing locations, will serve as strong and sustainable growth drivers for our business performance in the years ahead."" Mr. Feng Lin, Chief Financial Officer of Uxin, stated, ""Our strong sales growth this quarter was driven by improved inventory availability at existing stores and the continued ramp-up of our new superstore in Wuhan. Total revenues reached RMB658.3 million, including RMB607.6 million from retail vehicle sales, representing 87% year-over-year growth and 31% sequential growth. Our gross margin was 5.2%, reflecting the temporary impact of the new car price war in China, as well as the early-stage ramp-up of our Wuhan superstore. Looking ahead, we anticipate that unhealthy price competition in China's new car market will be largely resolved thanks to supportive government policies and sales and profitability of our Wuhan superstore will continue to improve. As a result, we anticipate a strong rebound in our overall gross margin in the near future. Specifically, for the third quarter of 2025, we expect retail transaction volume of 13,500 to 14,000 units, representing over 125% year-over-year growth, total revenues of between RMB830 million and RMB860 million, and gross margin recovery to approximately 7.5%."" Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 Total revenues were RMB658.3 million (US$91.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 30.6% from RMB504.2 million in the last quarter and an increase of 64.1% from RMB401.2 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to the increase in retail vehicle sales revenue. Retail vehicle sales revenue was RMB607.6 million (US$84.8 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 30.5% from RMB465.5 million in the last quarter and an increase of 87.0% from RMB325.0 million in the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, retail transaction volume was 10,385 units, representing an increase of 37.6% from 7,545 units last quarter and an increase of 153.9% from 4,090 units in the same period last year. By offering quality products and services, the Company's superstores have earned customer trust and established Uxin as the well-recognized brand in regional markets, leading to a high in-store customer conversion rate. Additionally, since the Company's newly launched superstore in Wuhan commenced trial operations in February 2025, both its inventory levels and sales have increased rapidly. Wholesale vehicle sales revenue was RMB29.9 million (US$4.2 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB22.5 million in the last quarter and RMB63.9 million in the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, wholesale transaction volume was 1,221 units, representing an increase of 69.8% from 719 units last quarter and a decrease of 19.4% from 1,515 units in the same period last year. Wholesale vehicle sales represent vehicles purchased by the Company from individuals that do not meet the Company's retail standards and are subsequently sold through online and offline channels. Other revenue was RMB20.8 million (US$2.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB16.2 million in the last quarter and RMB12.3 million in the same period last year. Cost of revenues was RMB624.1 million (US$87.1 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB468.9 million in the last quarter and RMB375.6 million in the same period last year. Gross margin was 5.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with 7.0% in the last quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross margin was mainly due to aggressive promotions in the new car sector in China during this quarter, which also put pressure on the gross margin for used cars. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was mainly due to the trial operation of our new superstore in Wuhan, which commenced in February 2025. As the store is still in the early stage of operation, it is currently in a gross profit ramp-up phase. The Company expects that its overall gross margin will recover in the third quarter of 2025. Total operating expenses were RMB96.7 million (US$13.5 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Total operating expenses excluding the impact of share-based compensation were RMB86.8 million. - Sales and marketing expenses were RMB74.2 million (US$10.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 20.3% from RMB61.7 million in the last quarter and an increase of 25.0% from RMB59.4 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to the increased salaries for the sales teams. - General and administrative expenses were RMB19.4 million (US$2.7 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 6.0% from RMB18.3 million in the last quarter and a decrease of 30.9% from RMB28.1 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the impact of share-based compensation expenses. - Research and development expenses were RMB3.1 million (US$0.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 6.6% from RMB2.9 million in the last quarter and a decrease of 8.6% from RMB3.4 million in the same period last year. Other operating income, net was RMB19.4 million (US$2.7 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB11.9 million for the last quarter and RMB2.8 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to gains from derecognition of certain long-aged liabilities. Loss from operations was RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB35.3 million in the last quarter and RMB62.5 million in the same period last year. Interest expenses were RMB23.1 million (US$3.2 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 2.5% from RMB22.5 million in the last quarter and an increase of 1.0% from RMB22.9 million in the same period last year. Net loss from operations was net loss of RMB67.6 million (US$9.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with net loss of RMB51.4 million in the last quarter and net loss of RMB49.8 million in the same period last year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was a loss of RMB16.5 million (US$2.3 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with a loss of RMB8.9 million in the last quarter and a loss of RMB33.9 million in the same period last year. Liquidity The Company has incurred net losses since inception. For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the Company incurred net loss of RMB67.6 million and operating cash outflow of RMB131.8 million, and the Company's current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately RMB202.2 million and the Company had accumulated deficit in the amount of RMB19.7 billion as of June 30, 2025. Based on the Company's liquidity assessment, which considers the management's plan to address these adverse conditions and events including growing its vehicle sales revenue by increasing the sales volume, improving the gross profit margin by increasing the value-added services offered to its customers, maintaining vehicle turnover rate by managing reasonable vehicle prices, raising funds from planned financings, and adjusting its operation scale if and when necessary, the Company believes that it is probable to effectively implement these plans and accordingly, its current cash and cash equivalents which included funds from equity and debt financings and the cash flows from operations are sufficient for the Company to meet its anticipated working capital requirements and other capital commitments and the Company will be able to meet its payment obligations when liabilities that fall due within the next twelve months from the date of this release. Recent Development On September 27, 2025, Uxin officially opened its fourth used car superstore in Zhengzhou, Henan Province. The new facility spans approximately 150,000 square meters, can display up to 5,000 vehicles and integrates an advanced reconditioning factory. Situated in central China's key transportation hub, Zhengzhou provides strong market fundamentals with over 13 million residents and 5 million registered vehicles. The superstore's opening marks another successful replication of Uxin's large-scale superstore model and further strengthens the Company's market presence in central China. Business Outlook For the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Company expects its retail transaction volume to range between 13,500 units and 14,000 units. The Company estimates that its total revenues including retail vehicle sales revenue, wholesale vehicle sales revenue and other revenue to range between RMB830 million and RMB860 million. The Company expects its gross profit margin to be around 7.5%.

We are committed to upholding our customer-centric approach and driving the healthy development of China's used car industry. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses certain non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss from operations per share – basic and diluted, as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange (losses)/gain, other income/(expenses), structure realignment cost which was mainly severance cost and equity in income of affiliates. The Company defines adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share – basic and diluted as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share excluding impact of share-based compensation, deemed dividend to preferred shareholders due to triggering of a down round feature and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitate investors' assessment of its operating performance as this measure excludes certain finance or non-cash items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations. The Company believe that excluding these items enables us to evaluate our performance period-over-period more effectively and relative to our competitors. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA is that it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation, other income/(expenses) and foreign exchange (losses)/gain have been and may continue to be incurred in the business. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of Uxin's non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.

(NASDAQ: POCI), a leading designer and manufacturer of advanced optical instruments for the medical and defense/aerospace industries, announced operating results on an unaudited basis for its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 for the period ended June 30, 2025. Q4 2025 Financial Highlights (3 Months Ended June 30, 2025): - Revenue was $6.2 million, a new quarterly record, compared to $4.7 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year and compared to $4.2 million in the most recent sequential quarter, representing growth of approximately 48%. - Production revenue was $5.1 million compared to $2.8 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year and compared to $3.3 million in the most recent sequential quarter, representing growth of approximately 54%. - Engineering revenue was $1.1 million compared to $1.9 million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year and compared to $0.9 million in the most recent sequential quarter. - Gross margins were 13.0% compared to 21.7% in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year and compared to 10.0% in the most recent sequential quarter. - Net loss for the quarter was $(1.4) million, compared to $(1.4) million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, and compared to $(2.1) million in the most recent sequential quarter. - Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.9) million for the quarter compared to $(1.1) million in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year and compared to $(1.3) million in the most recent sequential quarter. FY 2025 Financial Highlights (Year Ended June 30, 2025): - Revenue was $19.1 million compared to $19.1 million in the previous fiscal year. - Production revenue was $14.2 million compared to $10.6 million in the previous fiscal year, representing growth of approximately 34%. Engineering revenue was $4.9 million compared to $8.5 million in the previous fiscal year. - Gross margins were 17.8% compared to 30.3% in the previous fiscal year. - Net loss was ($5.8) million compared to $(3.0) million in the previous fiscal year. - Adjusted EBITDA was $(3.7) million compared to $(1.6) million in the previous fiscal year. FY 2026 Financial Guidance (Year Ended June 30, 2026): - The Company projects for the fiscal year 2026 revenue to be in excess of $25 million, which represents 31% growth over the Company’s fiscal year 2025 revenue. - The Company expects fiscal year 2026 gross margin to be approximately 30%, an improvement compared to 18% in fiscal 2025. - The Company projects fiscal year 2026 Adjusted EBITDA be approximately $0.5 million compared to $(3.7) million in fiscal 2025. “During the fourth quarter, we reported quarterly revenue of $6.2 million, a new record for the Company and up 31% from the year ago quarter, as we executed against a strong order backlog driven by recent multi-year agreements with a top tier aerospace company and a surgical robotics company,” commented Dr. Joe Forkey, CEO of Precision Optics. “The challenges we faced in getting production lines ramping to greater volumes had greater financial impact than anticipated. However, the underlying growth in the business is the source. Our two largest production customers are asking us to produce greater quantities, and we are working to add to our production capacity to meet demand. It is our current expectation that fiscal 2026 revenue will be approximately $25 million, which would equate to over 30% growth from fiscal 2025.” “Margins were impacted by production yields, staffing and efficiency challenges along with unanticipated tariff costs. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2026 we renegotiated pricing agreements with one customer to account for some of the yield shortfalls, and we expect the impact of design revisions and related manufacturing improvements to be in place later this year. These improvements are expected to result in continued gross margin gains from quarter to quarter during Fiscal 2026. Finally, we are kicking off new product development engagements resulting from our expanded outreach that will increase utilization of our engineering resources. All told, our expectation is for gross margin improvement of more than ten percentage points in fiscal 2026 with further improvements in future years.” Appointment of New Chief Operating Officer The Company today announced the appointment of Joseph Traut as the Company's new Chief Operating Officer effective October 1, 2025. Mr. Traut will lead the operations team, including its production and engineering activities at its facilities in Massachusetts, Maine and Texas. Prior to joining Precision Optics, he held senior operations management roles with numerous medical device companies. In connection with Mr. Traut joining the Company, in addition to his salary and benefits, the Compensation Committee and Board of the Company approved the grant of an inducement stock option to be granted on his Start Date, to purchase 60,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Option was granted pursuant to the Nasdaq Rule 5635(c)(4) inducement grant exception as a component of the individual’s employment compensation and was granted as an inducement material to his acceptance of employment with the Company. Mr. Traut’s option has an exercise price equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Capital Market on October 1, 2025. The options have a ten-year term and vest in three equal annual installments, subject to Mr. Traut’s continued service with the Company through the applicable vesting dates. Forkey commented, “I am pleased to welcome Joe Traut as our new COO. Joe has specific expertise in building effective operations teams and transferring manufacturing operations both internationally and domestically with a history of improving business performance through operational excellence methodology and improved manufacturing efficiency. I look forward to his contributions as we continue to rapidly scale our operations.” The following table summarizes the fourth quarter and fiscal year results for the periods ended June 30, 2025, and 2024: Conference Call Details Date and Time: Monday, September 29, 2025, at 5:00 p.m. ET.

For more information, please visit Non-GAAP Financial Measures Precision Optics has provided in this press release financial information that has not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the Unites States of America (“non-GAAP”). The non-GAAP financial measure is Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). In addition to the aforementioned items, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes from Net Income (Loss) the effect of stock-based compensation. This non-GAAP financial measure assists Precision Optics management in comparing its operating performance over time because certain items may obscure the underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult, as they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency or relate to discrete acquisition or restructuring plans that are fundamentally different from the ongoing productivity of the Company. Precision Optics management also believes that presenting this measure allows investors to view its performance using the same measures that the Company uses in evaluating its financial and business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure presented above to GAAP results has been provided in the financial tables included with this press release.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that C3.ai and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm urges investors in C3.ai who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Feb. 26, 2025 – Aug. 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 21, 2025 Visit: Contact the Firm Now: 844-916-0895 C3.ai, Inc. (AI) Securities Class Action: According to the complaint, filed under the caption Liggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuit alleges that these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive. The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%. The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later than October 21, 2025. “We’re focused on whether C3.ai’s public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health was affecting the company’s ability to close deals and meet financial targets,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR TRONOX INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On July 30, 2025, Tronox released its second quarter 2025 financial results, revealing a significant reduction in sales for its TiO2 product, citing “softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics.” Additionally, the Company revised its 2025 financial outlook, lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%. On this news, Tronox’s stock price fell $1.95, or 37.9%, to close at $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, thereby injuring investors. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) the Company was ill-equipped to adequately forecast demand for its pigment and zircon products or otherwise minimize the impact of potential demand fluctuations; (2) the Company continued to promote its lofty margin projections which relied upon continually increased sales volumes in its pigment and zircon division; and (3) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired Tronox common stock during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than November 3, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

(Nasdaq: MRUS) announced today that they have entered into a transaction agreement pursuant to which Genmab intends to acquire all the shares of Merus, a clinical-stage biotechnology company with its late-stage breakthrough therapy asset petosemtamab, which is in Phase 3 development, for USD 97.00 per share in an all-cash transaction representing a transaction value of approximately USD 8.0 billion. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies. A wholly owned subsidiary of Genmab (“Purchaser”) will commence a tender offer for 100% of Merus’ common shares, which is anticipated to close by early in the first quarter of 2026. The proposed acquisition of Merus is expected to meaningfully accelerate Genmab’s shift to a wholly owned model, expanding and diversifying the company’s revenue, driving sustained growth into the next decade and contributing to Genmab’s evolution into a biotechnology leader. The addition of petosemtamab, Merus’ lead asset, to Genmab’s promising late-stage pipeline is a compelling strategic fit with Genmab’s portfolio and aligns with Genmab’s expertise in antibody therapy development and commercialization in oncology. Following the closing of the transaction, Genmab will have four proprietary programs expected to drive multiple new drug launches by 2027. “The proposed acquisition of Merus clearly aligns with our long-term strategy. It has the potential to significantly accelerate our evolution into a global biotechnology leader by providing durable growth for the company well into the next decade,” said Jan van de Winkel, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Genmab. “Petosemtamab has the potential to be a transformational therapy for patients living with head and neck cancer. With our proven track record of success, both in clinical development and in commercialization, we are confident that we will be able to unlock the promise of petosemtamab.” “We are excited for the opportunity to join Genmab, a leader in antibody therapeutics, to further develop and bring petosemtamab to patients. Our two companies have a rich history of innovation with multiple approvals in the field of multispecific antibodies. We believe Genmab has the right vision and experience to advance petosemtamab in recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer and beyond,” said Bill Lundberg, M.D., President, Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “I’m immensely proud of the Merus team who have pioneered our foundational platform technologies to make better medicines and who have demonstrated - with an approved product and a product candidate, petosemtamab, in registrational studies - an ability to deliver on our promise to close in on cancer.” Petosemtamab is an EGFRxLGR5 bispecific antibody with the potential to be both first- and best-in-class in head and neck cancer. It has been granted two Breakthrough Therapy Designations (BTD) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for first- and second-line plus head and neck cancer indications. Of note, compelling Phase 2 data was presented at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 Annual Meeting showing both an overall response rate and median progression free survival that were substantially higher than standard of care. Merus is currently running two Phase 3 trials in first- and second/third line head and neck cancer, with topline interim readout of one or both trials anticipated in 2026. Based on Genmab’s experience in late-stage development and excellence in commercial execution, Genmab anticipates the potential for the initial launch of petosemtamab in 2027, subject to clinical results and regulatory approvals. Genmab also intends to broaden and accelerate petosemtamab’s development with potential expansion into earlier lines of therapy. Following its initial anticipated approval, Genmab believes that petosemtamab will be accretive to EBITDA with at least one-billion-dollar annual sales potential by 2029, with multi-billion-dollar annual revenue potential thereafter. Details of the Transaction and Financing Under the transaction agreement, Purchaser, a wholly owned subsidiary of Genmab, will commence a tender offer for all the outstanding common shares of Merus. Following the closing of the tender offer, Merus and Genmab will effect a series of transactions resulting in Genmab owning 100% of the common shares of Merus (or a successor entity). Depending on the structure of the back end transactions, Merus shareholders that do not tender their shares into the tender offer will either receive the same consideration for their common shares as the common shares tendered into the tender offer (subject to applicable withholding taxes) or a fair price for their common shares determined by a Dutch court in statutory buy-out proceedings. The closing of the tender offer is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions for similar transactions, including a minimum acceptance condition of at least 80% of Merus’ common shares (which threshold may be reduced to 75% unilaterally by Genmab if all other closing conditions are satisfied), approval by Merus’ shareholders of resolutions relating to Merus’ post-closing governance and the back end transactions at Merus’ extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held for that purpose, and completion of the relevant works councils consultation processes. The USD 97.00 per common share purchase price payable in the tender offer represents a premium of approximately 41% over Merus’ closing stock price on September 26, 2025, of USD 68.89 and approximately 44% over Merus’ 30-day volume weighted average price of USD 67.42. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. Consideration is expected to be funded through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $5.5 billion of non-convertible debt financing. Genmab has obtained a funding commitment from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. for this amount. The financing package includes a meaningful portion of prepayable debt, in line with Genmab’s commitment to deleveraging with a target of gross leverage <3x within two years after the closing of the proposed transaction. Today’s news does not impact Genmab’s financial guidance for the full year 2025, last issued on August 7, 2025. Genmab will provide its financial outlook for the full year 2026 in conjunction with its full year 2025 earnings report in February 2026. PJT Partners and Morgan Stanley & Co.

(NASDAQ: LFMD) and its executives. The suit alleges the telehealth company presented a misleadingly optimistic picture of its financial health and growth, ultimately resulting in a dramatic stock price decline in August. The action was filed in the Eastern District of New York. The lawsuit, Johnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7, 2025, and August 5, 2025, and is seeking to recover damages for investors who suffered substantial losses Video: The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. - Class Period: May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 27, 2025 - Contact the Firm Now: - Phone: 844-916-0895 - Email: - Website Form: Allegations: Optimistic Guidance Unraveled by Internal Issues: The complaint highlights a pivotal moment on May 6, 2025, when LifeMD reported strong first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The company touted a “category-defining competitive moat” in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand. However, the lawsuit contends that this optimistic outlook was misleading because the company allegedly failed to disclose critical, ongoing business challenges, including: - Rising Customer Acquisition Costs (RexMD): The company was reportedly experiencing a surge in costs to acquire new customers in its RexMD segment. - Higher-Than-Anticipated Refund Rate: There was a higher-than-expected rate of patient refunds in its weight management business. The alleged deception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance. During the earnings call, management cited the very issues the lawsuit alleges were previously concealed: “temporary elevated customer acquisition costs” for RexMD and problems with patient refunds for its weight management offerings. The following day, LifeMD’s stock price plummeted by over 44%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Hagens Berman, a national plaintiffs’ rights firm, is actively investigating these claims on behalf of damaged investors. “The core issue here is whether LifeMD's management provided an accurate foundation for its bullish financial guidance,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. “We are investigating if the company knew about the severe impact of rising customer acquisition costs and refund issues on its key revenue streams, yet chose to conceal these facts to artificially inflate its stock price.” If you invested in LifeMD and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now » If you’d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the LifeMD case and our investigation, read more » Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding LifeMD should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

(KBR) Faces Securities Class Action Amid TRANSCOM Contract Termination – Hagens Berman","SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A new class-action lawsuit is targeting KBR, Inc. (NYSE: KBR), alleging the company made misleading statements to investors in the weeks leading up to the abrupt cancellation of a major military contract. The suit, Norrman v. KBR, Inc., et al., No. 4:25-cv-04464 (S.D. Tex.), was filed after the company’s stock plunged following the termination of a multi-billion-dollar deal. National shareholders rights firm Hagens Berman urges KBR investors who suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. The firm also encourages persons with knowledge who may be able to assist in the investigation to contact its attorneys. Class Period: May 6, 2025 – June 19, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Nov. 18, 2025 Visit: Contact the Firm Now: | 844-916-0895 KBR, Inc. (KBR) Securities Class Action: The legal action seeks to represent shareholders who purchased KBR securities between May 6, 2025, and June 19, 2025. It claims that KBR executives provided a falsely optimistic outlook on a crucial partnership just as it was on the verge of collapse. The litigation stems from the Department of Defense U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) canceling its global household goods contract with HomeSafe Alliance LLC, a joint venture led by KBR. The decision, announced on June 20, 2025, caused KBR shares to fall over 7% as investors reacted to the loss of a contract valued at up to $20 billion over a potential nine-year term. The suit highlights a key discrepancy: on May 6, 2025, during its Q1 earnings call, KBR assured investors that the HomeSafe partnership was ""strong"" and ""excellent"" and that the company was ""very confident in the future of this program."" However, just weeks later, on June 19, 2025, HomeSafe disclosed that TRANSCOM had terminated the contract for cause. The termination reportedly came after months of operational issues, including chronic delays, missed pickups, and a rise in complaints about damaged goods. The complaint alleges that KBR was aware of TRANSCOM’s material concerns but chose to conceal them from investors. The lawsuit argues that this misrepresentation led to the significant financial losses suffered by shareholders. “We’re focused on whether KBR may have intentionally misled investors about the true status of the relationship with TRANSCOM and the contract,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. If you invested in KBR and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now.

The market growth is fueled by rising demand for live music experiences, festivals, and destination-based events that combine travel with entertainment. Strong contributions from regions such as North America and Europe continue to drive revenue, while Asia-Pacific is emerging as a rapidly expanding hub for international music tourism. The industry benefits from the increasing popularity of mega music festivals, cross-border travel for concerts, and digital platforms that boost global visibility of live events. Partnerships between tourism boards, event organizers, and hospitality providers are further strengthening the ecosystem by offering bundled travel and event packages. The market's expansion is also supported by rising disposable incomes and consumer preference for cultural experiences, making music tourism a central part of lifestyle-driven travel spending worldwide. Browse the report and understand how it can benefit your business strategy - Key Growth Determinants Rising Popularity of Music Festivals and Live Events Global music festivals such as Coachella, Glastonbury, and Tomorrowland attract millions of international visitors annually. These events not only promote local tourism but also create strong demand for travel, hospitality, and entertainment services. The growing trend of combining travel with live performances remains a key growth driver for the market. Increasing Disposable Income and Experience-Centric Spending Higher disposable incomes, especially among millennials and Gen Z, are fueling demand for travel experiences over material goods. Music tourism fits this trend by offering cultural engagement, entertainment, and leisure in one package. This shift toward experiential spending is significantly boosting global market revenues. Government and Industry Support for Cultural Tourism Tourism boards and governments are actively promoting music events as part of cultural tourism strategies. Partnerships with airlines, hotels, and local businesses enhance accessibility and affordability for travelers. These initiatives create an enabling environment for sustained growth in music tourism across both developed and emerging regions. Key Growth Barriers High Travel and Event Costs One of the major barriers to music tourism growth is the high cost associated with travel, accommodation, and event participation. Premium ticket prices for globally renowned festivals, coupled with rising airfare and hotel expenses, often make music tourism unaffordable for a large segment of consumers. Middle-income groups, particularly in developing regions, find it difficult to justify such spending, limiting overall participation. This cost factor becomes even more critical during periods of economic slowdown or inflation, when discretionary spending on travel and leisure decreases significantly. Safety and Security Concerns Music tourism events are often characterized by large gatherings, which can create safety and crowd management issues. Risks related to overcrowding, stampedes, health emergencies, and even terrorist threats have raised concerns among travelers and regulators. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the vulnerabilities of such gatherings, with strict health regulations and restrictions impacting event attendance. Even in the post-pandemic era, lingering fears about safety and hygiene can deter potential tourists. Event organizers must continue to invest in strong security, medical response teams, and digital ticketing systems to build traveler confidence. Key Market Trends Growing Integration of Technology in Music Tourism Digital platforms and streaming services are playing a vital role in promoting music festivals and concerts to a global audience. Mobile apps for event booking, AR/VR concert experiences, and AI-driven recommendations are improving customer engagement. Technology integration is reshaping how tourists discover, plan, and participate in music-related travel. Rising Popularity of Destination Festivals Tourists are increasingly traveling across borders to attend music festivals tied to iconic destinations. Events like Ibiza's electronic music festivals or Bali's beach concerts combine cultural tourism with entertainment. This trend is boosting partnerships between tourism boards, airlines, and festival organizers to create bundled travel and event experiences. Strong Focus on Sustainability and Eco-Friendly Events Sustainable practices are becoming central to music tourism, with festivals adopting waste management, renewable energy, and carbon offset programs. Travelers, especially younger generations, prefer events that demonstrate environmental responsibility. Green initiatives are not only improving brand image but also attracting a socially conscious audience base. Key Opportunities Expansion into Emerging Markets Emerging economies in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Africa present significant untapped opportunities for music tourism. Rapid urbanization, rising middle-class populations, and improving travel infrastructure are boosting demand for international entertainment experiences. Local governments are also promoting cultural and music festivals to attract global tourists, creating favorable conditions for market growth. Growth of Hybrid and Virtual Music Experiences The rise of virtual concerts and hybrid events offers new revenue channels for organizers and destinations. Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) platforms enable global audiences to participate without geographical limitations. Combining physical tourism with digital engagement allows organizers to reach broader audiences while enhancing accessibility. Collaboration Between Tourism and Hospitality Sectors Partnerships between event organizers, airlines, hotels, and travel agencies are creating bundled packages that simplify planning for tourists.

Strong infrastructure, high disposable incomes, and a thriving live music culture contribute to the region's leadership. The United States remains the core market, while Canada also attracts growing inbound tourism through events like Osheaga and the Montreal Jazz Festival. Europe (Market Share: Second Largest in 2024) Europe holds the second-largest share, fueled by its diverse cultural heritage and global music festivals. Iconic events such as Glastonbury in the UK, Tomorrowland in Belgium, and Primavera Sound in Spain attract millions of international tourists annually. Supportive government initiatives and strong cross-border travel networks make Europe a hub for both large-scale festivals and niche cultural music events. Asia-Pacific (Fastest Growing Region) Asia-Pacific is projected to be the fastest-growing region, supported by rising disposable incomes and rapid tourism development. Countries such as Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and India are gaining recognition for hosting international concerts and festivals. Expanding airline connectivity and government-backed cultural tourism programs are further boosting the region's attractiveness to global music tourists. Latin America and Middle East & Africa (Emerging Markets) Latin America shows steady growth, led by Brazil's Rock in Rio and Argentina's Lollapalooza, which attract both regional and international visitors. The Middle East and Africa are still emerging but present strong opportunities, with Dubai and South Africa positioning themselves as cultural hotspots. Investments in tourism infrastructure and growing demand for international entertainment experiences are expected to strengthen these regions' future roles in the music tourism market.

It further stated that clients are cutting back on capital expenditures. These challenges were not previously disclosed when the Company reaffirmed its full-year outlook.

Reminds Investors of Tronox, Savara, Quantum, and Fly-E that Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Tronox Holdings plc (NYSE:TROX), Savara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA), Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO), and Fly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Tronox Holdings plc (NYSE:TROX) - Class Period: February 12, 2025, to July 30, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025 - According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Tronox’s ability to forecast the demand for its pigment and zircon products or otherwise the true state of its commercial division, despite making lofty long-term projections, Tronox’s forecasting processes fell short as sales continued to decline and costs increased, ultimately, derailing the Company’s revenue projections. - On July 30, 2025, Tronox announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, revealing a significant reduction in TiO2 sales for the quarter. The Company attributed the decline to “softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics.” As a result of the setback in sales, defendants revised the Company’s 2025 financial outlook lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%. - Following this news, Tronox’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $5.14 per share on July 30, 2025, Tronox’s stock price fell to $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, a decline of about 38% in the span of just a single day. - For more information on the Tronox lawsuit go to: Savara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA) - Class Period: March 7, 2024 to May 23, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025 - According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI Biologics License Application (""BLA"") lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; and (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital. - Plaintiff alleges that on May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release ""announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file (""RTF"")] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap]."" Specifically, Savara revealed that ""[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC)."" On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025. - For more information on the Savara lawsuit go to: Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO) - Class Period: November 15, 2024, to August 18, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025 - According to the lawsuit, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Quantum Corporation improperly recognized revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025; (2) as a result, Quantum Corporation would need to restate its previously filed financial statements for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. - For more information on the Quantum lawsuit go to: Fly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE) - Class Period: July 15, 2025, to August 14, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025 - According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to the Company's projected revenue outlook and anticipated sales. In truth, Fly-E's optimistic revenue goals and demand for its EV products and services fell short of reality; defendants continually praised Fly-E's brand reputation in the industry, cost reductions and favorable pricing from suppliers as a key component for Fly-E's ability to grow its sales network, while simultaneously minimizing risks associated with its lithium battery, supply chain changes and the regulatory environment and possible demand fluctuations for its E-Bikes and E-Scooters. - On August 14, 2025, Fly-E filed with the SEC a form NT 10-Q: Notification of inability to timely file Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The filing revealed a significant 32% decrease in Fly-E's net revenue compared to the same period in 2024. Notably, defendants stated that the primary driver for the revenue decrease was a decline of ""total units sold"" as customers were less inclined to purchase E-Bikes due to an ""increasing number of lithium battery explosion incidents in New York"". Although there was mention of sector wide lithium battery incidents in the 10-K filed on July 15, 2025, none were specific to Fly-E's lithium battery. Further, Defendants reiterated the fact that the EV industry is ""subject to extensive environmental, safety and other laws and regulations, which include products safety and testing, as well as battery safety and disposal."" On this news, the price of Fly-E's declined dramatically, from a closing market price of $7.76 per share on August 14, 2025, to $1.00 per share on August 15, 2025, a decline of about 87% in the span of just a single day. - For more information on the Fly-E lawsuit go to: About Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.
