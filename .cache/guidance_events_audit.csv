Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured above DKK 3,000 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus entering the targeted guidance interval for this business. COPENHAGEN, Denmark, July 9, 2025 – Bavarian Nordic A/S (OMX: BAVA) today announced the award of a contract valued over DKK 200 million to supply its MVA-BN ® smallpox/mpox vaccine to a European country. This is another larger order in recent years from the country to strengthen national preparedness against biological threats and epidemics like smallpox and mpox. Paul Chaplin, President & CEO of Bavarian Nordic , said: “As Europe continues to strengthen its resilience in the face of evolving geopolitical threats, we are proud to support efforts to increase public health security by supplying our MVA-BN ® smallpox/mpox vaccine, which remains a vital tool for managing mpox outbreaks as well as for safeguarding populations against future smallpox threats. This new order underscores the growing recognition of biological preparedness as a cornerstone of national and regional security. We remain committed to working with EU and its member states to ensure rapid access to critical medical countermeasures, reinforcing public health infrastructure and contributing to a safer, more secure future. We are also pleased to extend our collaboration with countries outside Europe, demonstrating the value of our long-term partnerships to build and strengthen preparedness.” The order will be delivered in 2025. Along with other orders recently secured from non-European countries, it brings the total value of secured contracts in the Public Preparedness business to slightly above DKK 3,000 million, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this arm of the business for 2025 (DKK 3,000-4,000 million). Total revenue and EBITDA margin for the year remain unchanged at DKK 5,700-6,700 million and 26-30% respectively. About the smallpox/mpox vaccine MVA-BN or Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic is the only non-replicating mpox vaccine approved in the U.S., Switzerland, Singapore and Mexico (marketed as JYNNEOS ® ), Canada (marketed as IMVAMUNE ® ), and the EU/EAA and United Kingdom (marketed as IMVANEX ® ). Originally developed as a smallpox vaccine in collaboration with the U.S. government to ensure the supply of a smallpox vaccine for the entire population, including immunocompromised individuals who are not recommended vaccination with traditional replicating smallpox vaccines, MVA-BN has been indicated for use in the general population in individuals considered at risk for smallpox or mpox infection. About Bavarian Nordic Bavarian Nordic is a global vaccine company with a mission to improve health and save lives through innovative vaccines. We are a preferred supplier of mpox and smallpox vaccines to governments to enhance public health preparedness and have a leading portfolio of travel vaccines.

Outlook and guidance Finnair’s guidance regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result for 2025 has been clarified following the end of industrial action. Guidance excluding any direct impact of industrial action is unchanged. However, Finnair specifies that, based on the current information, the comparable operating result is estimated to be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Under Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025, the company provides additional information on the impacts of industrial action, as well as an estimate of capacity growth, revenue and comparable operating result in 2025, considering the direct impacts of industrial action. Outlook and guidance on 16 July 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability and the threat of trade wars cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts are elevated. Excluding the direct impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. In 2025, profitability is further burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the second quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates above regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include direct impacts of industrial action. In total, the direct negative impact of industrial action in 2025 is estimated to be approximately 100 million euros on revenue, approximately 70 million euros on comparable operating result and approximately 5% on the total capacity, measured by ASKs. In the first half of 2025, industrial action had a direct impact of around -72 million euros on revenue and around -51 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, the three days of industrial action in July and the flights cancelled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following industrial action, including wet lease out flights, are estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 25 million euros, other operating income by approximately 5 million euros and comparable operating result by approximately 20 million euros in the third quarter. Based on the cancellations confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a direct negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Considering the direct negative impacts of industrial action, Finnair plans to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 5% year-on-year and estimates its revenue to be within the range of 3.2–3.3 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 30–130 million euros in 2025. However, based on the current information, the company estimates that the comparable operating result will be closer to the lower end of the given range, due to weaker-than-expected demand in North Atlantic traffic and the indirect effects of industrial action on demand in broader terms. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the interim report January–September 2025. Previous outlook and guidance issued on 29 April 2025 Global air traffic is expected to continue growing in 2025. However, international conflicts, global political instability, the threat of trade wars and a tense labour market situation in Finland cause uncertainty in the operating environment. In particular, the risk levels related to tariffs between different countries and their direct and indirect impacts have increased. Excluding the impact of industrial action, Finnair has planned to increase its total capacity, measured by ASKs, by c. 10% in 2025. The capacity estimate includes the agreed wet leases. Finnair has anticipated its revenue to be within the range of 3.3–3.4 billion euros and its comparable operating result to be within the range of 100–200 million euros in 2025. In 2025, profitability is burdened particularly by additional costs caused by the sustainable aviation fuel distribution obligation introduced in the EU, as well as rising navigation and landing charges. The direct cost impact of tariffs that will enter into force after the first quarter is estimated to be limited. It is too early to estimate the magnitude of potential indirect effects. The estimates regarding capacity, revenue and comparable operating result do not include impacts of industrial action. In the first quarter of 2025, industrial action had a negative impact of around 31 million euros on revenue and around 22 million euros on the comparable operating result. In April 2025, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of around 15 million euros on revenue and around 10 million euros on the comparable operating result. In addition, regardless of the duration of industrial action, Finnair has decided to cancel 230 flights scheduled for the summer season due to a temporary lack of resources following the industrial action, which is estimated to negatively impact revenue by approximately 30 million euros and the comparable operating result by approximately 10 million euros. Based on the cancellations already confirmed, industrial action is estimated to have a negative impact of approximately 5% on the total capacity in 2025, measured by ASKs. Finnair will update its outlook and guidance in connection with the 2025 half-year report. CEO Turkka Kuusisto: The challenges Finnair faced at the beginning of the year continued into the second quarter. We carried over 3 million passengers, and our revenue grew slightly compared to the same period last year. However, our comparable operating result was particularly burdened by industrial action by the Finnish Airline Pilots’ Association in April and by the ground service personnel’s Finnish Aviation Union (IAU) in May and June. I want to extend my heartfelt apologies to each customer whose travel plans were disrupted by the industrial action. We reached collective labour agreements with the pilots, cabin crew, and travel agency staff during the quarter. The Service Sector Employers Palta and the IAU also came to an agreement after the period, so we are once again able to operate our flights with the reliability that is expected of us. The direct negative impact of the prolonged industrial action on second quarter revenue was around 41 million euros, on other operating income around 10 million euros, and on the comparable operating result around 29 million euros. We had to cancel over 1,300 flights during the quarter due to the industrial action, incurring costs related to customer rerouting and care, as well as compensation for delays. To support our customers’ important travel plans, we allowed them to reschedule flights away from the disruption days without additional fees, which reduced sales on the days to which flights were moved. The uncertainty caused by the disruptions also affected demand for our flights and customer satisfaction. Restoring customer trust and satisfaction is of primary importance to us, and we are systematically working towards this by taking care of our customers and their needs as well as possible, both in the development of our product and services and in our daily operations. Despite the disruptions caused by industrial action, our operational quality remained high, and we were able to operate 94% of our flights as planned. During the summer season, we operate about 350 flights per day, and even on disruption days, we managed to operate 60–75% of our flights. We have invested in improving the customer experience, particularly in terms of the smoothness of rerouting and customer communication, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of industrial action on our customers during the important summer travel season. During the quarter, general market uncertainties increased, which began to affect demand for transatlantic flights, and customers’ booking windows became shorter. Our North American traffic grew significantly, but the growth rate was more moderate than previously planned, and average ticket fares in the area declined. In other markets, demand developed as expected. We continued optimising our network and announced new summer 2026 routes to Toronto, Canada, and Alta in Northern Norway. We also added flights to Finnish Lapland for the winter 2025 season. In June, air travellers chose Finnair as the Best Airline in Northern Europe for the 15th consecutive time, and our cabin crew was also named the best in Northern Europe. This recognition is owed especially to Finnair employees in the front line who work with dedication every day to ensure safe and smooth flights.

Following the issuance of company announcement no. 83 at the end of April 2025, in which the company's board of directors chose to suspend the financial guidance for the financial year 2025 in light of the high geopolitical uncertainty, the board of directors has today decided to resume publication of the Company's financial guidance. The resumption is based on the following two elements: On Sunday, July 27, 2025, the US government and the EU Commission entered into a political agreement to impose a 15% import tariff on most EU goods. The agreement was described as a framework covering cars, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors – all subject to the 15% tariff – while a 50% tariff on steel and aluminium remained in force, as these were not included in the new agreement. As US is an important market for FOM, any clarity on import tariff rates are relevant to the company. A gradual return to a more normalized order flow and increased order intake following the end of H1 2025. Overall, the company believes in light of the above, a detailed review of the order intake and following the end of H1 2025 that there is now sufficient clarity on the expected overall development for 2025. The company's future and previous guidance (before suspension) is listed below: NEW FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2025: Total income: In the range from DKK 40 mio. to DKK 50 mio. EBITDA: In the range from DKK -25 mio. to DKK -15 mio.

Published: 2025-08-14 15:12:04 CEST North Media A/S - Inside information North Media upgrades its full-year EBITDA and EBIT guidance based on preliminary financial results for the second quarter of 2025. Company Announcement no. 10-2025 14 August 2025 Revenue for Q2 2025 was DKK 342m against DKK 343m in the year-earlier period. Last Mile saw a largely flat trend, with the expected decline in FK Distribution being outweighed by SDR having taken over local sales from former franchise partners. Digital Services improved by 2%, primarily driven by BoligPortal. EBITDA was DKK 48m against DKK 61m in Q2 2024, and EBIT was DKK 32m against DKK 44m in the year-earlier period. North Media expects its full-year revenue for 2025 to be in the DKK 1,270–1,315m range (previously DKK 1,280–1,337m), for EBITDA of DKK 105–130m (previously DKK 80–115m) and EBIT of DKK 50–75m (previously DKK 25–60m). The EBITDA and EBIT upgrade is mainly attributable to improved operations at SDR. The Group is now seeing the initial effects of the distribution model transition in the form of more stable planning, improved capacity utilisation and lower unit costs. North Media expects to see a gradually increasing effect as the implementation continues. Bekey also contributed positively to the upgrade. The downgraded revenue guidance reflects a small loss of volumes in Last Mile and lower-than-expected growth in BoligPortal and Dayli (MineTilbud) in Digital Services.

A/S 14 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, FLSmidth announces preliminary and unaudited financial results for Q2 2025 and H1 2025. In addition, the financial guidance for the full year 2025 is updated. As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 change its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. Preliminary and unaudited key figures for Q2 2025 and H1 2025 Service Products PC&V Consolidated Group Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Q2 2025 H1 2025 Revenue, DKK 2.1bn 4.2bn 0.6bn 1.4bn 0.7bn 1.4bn 3.4bn 7.1bn Adj.

In addition, the Adjusted EBITA margin now also excludes Other Operating Net Income totalling income of DKK 59m and DKK 77m in Q2 2025 and H1 2025, respectively. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% The financial guidance for the full year 2025 has been updated. As such, FLSmidth now expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth now expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for original equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025. Presentation of the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report FLSmidth will, as previously communicated, release the detailed and unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025 on 20 August 2025. FLSmidth will host a conference call for investors and analysts on Wednesday 20 August 2025 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. The presentation can be followed live or viewed as a replay via the internet here .

The comparative figures in brackets refer to the corresponding time period in the previous year, unless otherwise stated. CEO Elisa Markula: “Our profitability remained strong in the second quarter, supported by growing passenger volumes and a stable operational environment. Comparable net sales decreased by 5% due to the expiry of a few tendered traffic contracts. However, our comparable operating result remained at a good level, reaching EUR 36.7 (34.6) million. Our profit improvement measures were successful, and operational efficiency improved. The number of journeys on domestic long-distance trains continued to grow during the second quarter, with more and more leisure travellers choosing the train. Net sales in long-distance traffic increased, boosted by our acquisition in Sweden. However, track works and traffic disruptions weakened profitability compared to the comparison period. In Finland, customer experience reached an excellent level, with an NPS of 56 (44). VR City Traffic improved its comparable operating result in the second quarter, although the result remained negative due to the low profitability of older, long-term contracts. Revenue declined following the expiry of a few tendered traffic contracts. New contracts won in Sweden will begin later this year, supporting our strategic goal of profitable growth in the competitive Swedish market. Transport volumes at VR Logistics increased by 12% in the second quarter. Profitability remained at the previous year’s level, and comparable revenue increased by 5% year-on-year, despite growing market uncertainty towards the end of the quarter. We have continued our focused efforts to develop our services by improving delivery reliability, strengthening customer cooperation, and investing in low-emission solutions. Our strategy focuses on profitability, growth, and building a value-driven culture. Our goal is to achieve EUR 250 million in profit improvement measures by the end of 2027. This will ensure our future competitiveness and enable nearly EUR 1 billion in rolling stock investments. We have progressed as planned with our profit improvement programme. To enable future tendering of publicly funded passenger rail traffic in Finland, VR has established a rolling stock company for tendered rail traffic. The rolling stock currently used in this traffic, and owned by VR, will be transferred to this new company. The establishment of the rolling stock company is based on the Finnish Government Programme and the policy outlined by the Government’s Economic Policy Committee, which VR has implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Prime Minister’s Office’s ownership steering. The company is expected to be fully transferred from VR to state ownership during 2025. VR actively supports the promotion of competition in rail transport and is committed to building a sustainable and competitive transport system for the benefit of society as a whole. We continue to focus on our core business as a provider of passenger transport and rail logistics services. As part of this strategic direction, we continued the sale of station properties during the review period and have also sold used rolling stock to other operators in the industry. Building a future-proof VR is our shared goal. We have already made significant progress and will continue this work together with all our personnel. A warm thank you to our employees for their valuable contribution. We also thank our customers for their trust and cooperation – together we are building a functional and competitive transport system that serves all of society.” Outlook for 2025 VR estimates that the Group's net sales in 2025 will decrease slightly compared to the previous year due to the sale of the road logistics business and the expired tendered traffic contracts in Sweden. The new tendered traffic contracts won in Sweden will not start until the end of 2025. The Group's comparable operating result is estimated to improve compared to 2024. The outlook is subject to uncertainties in the business environment due to the general economic development.

CEO Mikko Karvinen comments on the development during the period: Nexstim continued its positive trend in terms of net sales growth and improved results during the first half of 2025. In H1 2025, we achieved total net sales of EUR 4.5 (3.2) million, representing growth of 41.8%. Gross margin increased by more than EUR 1 million from the comparable period last year to EUR 3.6 (2.6) million, which is a result of the favorable development of our sales volumes and prices. The increased customs duties in the United States did not have a significant impact on the results for the first half of 2025, and we have sought to minimize the potential impact of customs duties on future periods by taking them into account in new system sales offers. We were particularly pleased with the positive development of EBITDA during the first half of the year. EBITDA was EUR 0.2 (-0.5) million and was positively record-breaking for two consecutive half-years. The operating result for the first half of the year also showed improvement in the right direction, at EUR -0.2 (-0.9) million, with a result for the review period of EUR -0.3 (-0.9) million. The result was improved by a non-recurring item of EUR 0.2 million, which was the first installment of the license fee for the exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica. I thank Nexstim's customers, personnel, partners, and investors for the continuation of this positive development. In line with the main objective of Nexstim's 2025–2028 strategy, we have focused on profitable net sales growth, and our sales forecast for full year 2025 looks promising. This growth is now supported by our global distributor partner network, which was strengthened at the end of last year by the Brainlab cooperation agreement. We are now looking to take immediate advantage of this, particularly in the marketing and sales of diagnostics systems in the United States and Europe. In early 2025, we developed and trained our partner network for the Diagnostics business in close cooperation with Brainlab. This will enable us to effectively and comprehensively deliver our sales and marketing message to as many markets as possible among Brainlab's thousands of existing customers. In addition to this collaboration, Nexstim's direct sales and marketing still have significant opportunities for developing the Therapy business, research and neuroscience customers, and the clinic partner network. We aim to continue leveraging our expert and efficient global teams to ensure positive profitability development. This was reflected in the moderate 11 percent growth in operating expenses in early 2025, enabling a simultaneous 40 percent increase in gross margin. Business update We have continued to grow our Diagnostics (NBS, Navigated Brain Stimulation) and Therapy (NBT ® , Navigated Brain Therapy and NBS 6) businesses through the sale of new systems in our key markets in the US and Europe. Our growing installed base generates a steady stream of net sales which increases the stability and predictability of our operations. The Diagnostics business grew by 65.3% during the first half of 2025, with net sales of EUR 2.5 (1.5) million. We delivered a total of seven new diagnostic systems during H1 2025. To date, we have sold more than 250 diagnostic systems to research universities and leading hospitals around the world. We are pleased that more of our customers want to use Nexstim system for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The NBS System 5 configuration, NBS 5+, has enabled the use of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the same system. This offering means that all FDA 510(k) indications are available in the same system on the US market. Most of the diagnostic systems delivered in early 2025 have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We consider combination systems to be a clear competitive advantage and aim to launch the latest generation of NBS 6 combination systems in key markets during the second half of 2025, following regulatory approvals. Net sales from the therapy business decreased by 8.4% during the first half of 2025 and amounted to EUR 1.4 (1.6) million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in system sales in the Therapy business, which fell by 37.0% compared to the same period last year. During H1 2025, we delivered one purely therapeutic system to Europe and the rest of the world. This development was mainly since most of the therapy applications were delivered in connection with Diagnostics and Research and Neuroscience system. At the end of June 2025, there were a total of 116 Nexstim systems with therapy applications installed worldwide (43 in the United States and 73 in Europe and the rest of the world) for the treatment of depression and chronic neuropathic pain. This number includes both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems as well as NBS systems with optional NBT add-on software installed. With the new strategy period, we now also report separately the net sales of the Research and Neuroscience business, which grew by as much as 565.7% during the first half of 2025, amounting to EUR 0.6 (0.1) million. This rapid growth was due to the sale of two research systems and a EUR 0.2 million license fee from Sinaptica's exclusive agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned system already delivered, we had an open order backlog of eight systems at the end of June 2025. In June 2024, we announced disagreements regarding the licensing of our technology to the US medical technology company Magnus Medical, Inc. Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems. The importance of partnerships is likely to increase in the future in the Therapy business as well, as we leverage our unique expertise and technology in emerging treatment areas. Our second strategic objective for 2025 is to successfully support the long-term collaboration between Nexstim and Brainlab and to expand our network of other partners and clinics, primarily in the United States. I strongly believe that combining Nexstim's technological expertise and first-class services with Brainlab's innovative products, which have significant business growth potential and are well suited to Nexstim's offering and global customer base of leading hospitals, will create maximum value for patients, neurosurgeons, hospitals, and shareholders. Outside of Brainlab's exclusive rights, Nexstim will continue to independently develop, market, and sell its products and services in all markets for current and future neuroscience research solutions and therapeutic applications. This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area. The gross margin target set for 2025 is EUR 4 million. The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system. The development and launch of a new product generation will continue to be an essential part of Nexstim's operations during the 2025–2028 strategy period. NBS 6 is a new combination system built on Nexstim's unique, clinically established technology, with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Nexstim's NBS 6 system has FDA marketing and distribution approval for the treatment of major depression in the United States and is CE-approved in Europe for the treatment of major depression and chronic neuropathic pain. We will now continue to finalize the development of the system and progress regulatory approvals during 2025 so that, in line with our strategic objective, we will also have diagnostic applications launched in the key markets as part of the new NBS 6 system. Building future growth paths Our system clearly stands out from other TMS systems currently on the market, which do not have navigation features. In the future, the need for navigation functionality is likely to become even more important in technology, enabling more diverse treatment of brain disorders. This may open new markets for Nexstim in TMS treatments beyond severe depression and chronic neuropathic pain. The technological leadership, ease of use, and scalability of our product create an attractive foundation for growth through partnerships. In January 2025, the company announced the start of joint development of the SinaptiStim ® precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease together with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. (""Sinaptica""). The company announced that the planned delivery of the research system for the first validation testing, and future clinical trials was in March. Nexstim announced that it is developing the system according to Sinaptica's specifications, combining it with a high-resolution 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system from Bittium, which enables precision calibration of the therapy for each Alzheimer's patient. The new research system will be used in Sinaptica's upcoming clinical trials related to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with several studies planned to begin in 2025. At the end of June 2025, the Company announced that it had signed an exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. regarding the companies' planned collaboration in the field of Alzheimer's disease treatment. The signed agreement covers plans for 2025. The final agreement is expected to be drafted and signed before the end of the year. In June 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent with Sinaptica regarding the development, manufacture, and supply of Sinaptica's patented precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The system is based on Nexstim's NBS 6 medical TMS and neuronavigation systems and related software, including integrated EEG software. As part of the signed exclusive agreement, Sinaptica undertakes to order the research system it needs for clinical trials from Nexstim, and Nexstim will not commercialize its technology in the field of Alzheimer's disease independently or with partners other than Sinaptica. The agreed exclusivity is conditional upon payments of EUR 1.5 million in multiple installments to Nexstim during 2025. The planned partnership would be a global, 10-year exclusive arrangement. The financial structure of the partnership consists of a signing fee for the disclosed exclusivity rights, a milestone-based development project, and the sale of clinical and commercial system. The milestone-based project and purchases of clinical system are defined in more detail in the final agreements, which may be subject to change during negotiations. The long-term exclusive rights arrangement also depends on payments to be made by Sinaptica during 2025 and the signing of final agreements before the end of 2025. Building shareholder value while taking exceptional circumstances into account Despite the tense global political situation, our expectations for the rest of 2025 are positive in many ways. Our current business is heavily focused on the EU and the US, but with our new partners, we will continue to actively expand Nexstim's technology into the Asian market. Nexstim will continue its determined efforts to develop personalized and effective methods for the treatment and diagnosis of severe brain diseases and disorders. We strongly believe that our work will support long-term shareholder value growth in the form of increasingly strong competitive advantages, rapid growth, and improved financial results.

CEO Mikko Karvinen comments on the development during the period: Nexstim continued its positive trend in terms of net sales growth and improved results during the first half of 2025. In H1 2025, we achieved total net sales of EUR 4.5 (3.2) million, representing growth of 41.8%. Gross margin increased by more than EUR 1 million from the comparable period last year to EUR 3.6 (2.6) million, which is a result of the favorable development of our sales volumes and prices. The increased customs duties in the United States did not have a significant impact on the results for the first half of 2025, and we have sought to minimize the potential impact of customs duties on future periods by taking them into account in new system sales offers. We were particularly pleased with the positive development of EBITDA during the first half of the year. EBITDA was EUR 0.2 (-0.5) million and was positively record-breaking for two consecutive half-years. The operating result for the first half of the year also showed improvement in the right direction, at EUR -0.2 (-0.9) million, with a result for the review period of EUR -0.3 (-0.9) million. The result was improved by a non-recurring item of EUR 0.2 million, which was the first installment of the license fee for the exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica. I thank Nexstim's customers, personnel, partners, and investors for the continuation of this positive development. In line with the main objective of Nexstim's 2025–2028 strategy, we have focused on profitable net sales growth, and our sales forecast for full year 2025 looks promising. This growth is now supported by our global distributor partner network, which was strengthened at the end of last year by the Brainlab cooperation agreement. We are now looking to take immediate advantage of this, particularly in the marketing and sales of diagnostics systems in the United States and Europe. In early 2025, we developed and trained our partner network for the Diagnostics business in close cooperation with Brainlab. This will enable us to effectively and comprehensively deliver our sales and marketing message to as many markets as possible among Brainlab's thousands of existing customers. In addition to this collaboration, Nexstim's direct sales and marketing still have significant opportunities for developing the Therapy business, research and neuroscience customers, and the clinic partner network. We aim to continue leveraging our expert and efficient global teams to ensure positive profitability development. This was reflected in the moderate 11 percent growth in operating expenses in early 2025, enabling a simultaneous 40 percent increase in gross margin. Business update We have continued to grow our Diagnostics (NBS, Navigated Brain Stimulation) and Therapy (NBT ® , Navigated Brain Therapy and NBS 6) businesses through the sale of new systems in our key markets in the US and Europe. Our growing installed base generates a steady stream of net sales which increases the stability and predictability of our operations. The Diagnostics business grew by 65.3% during the first half of 2025, with net sales of EUR 2.5 (1.5) million. We delivered a total of seven new diagnostic systems during H1 2025. To date, we have sold more than 250 diagnostic systems to research universities and leading hospitals around the world. We are pleased that more of our customers want to use Nexstim system for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The NBS System 5 configuration, NBS 5+, has enabled the use of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the same system. This offering means that all FDA 510(k) indications are available in the same system on the US market. Most of the diagnostic systems delivered in early 2025 have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We consider combination systems to be a clear competitive advantage and aim to launch the latest generation of NBS 6 combination systems in key markets during the second half of 2025, following regulatory approvals. Net sales from the therapy business decreased by 8.4% during the first half of 2025 and amounted to EUR 1.4 (1.6) million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in system sales in the Therapy business, which fell by 37.0% compared to the same period last year. During H1 2025, we delivered one purely therapeutic system to Europe and the rest of the world. This development was mainly since most of the therapy applications were delivered in connection with Diagnostics and Research and Neuroscience system. At the end of June 2025, there were a total of 116 Nexstim systems with therapy applications installed worldwide (43 in the United States and 73 in Europe and the rest of the world) for the treatment of depression and chronic neuropathic pain. This number includes both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems as well as NBS systems with optional NBT add-on software installed. With the new strategy period, we now also report separately the net sales of the Research and Neuroscience business, which grew by as much as 565.7% during the first half of 2025, amounting to EUR 0.6 (0.1) million. This rapid growth was due to the sale of two research systems and a EUR 0.2 million license fee from Sinaptica's exclusive agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned system already delivered, we had an open order backlog of eight systems at the end of June 2025. In June 2024, we announced disagreements regarding the licensing of our technology to the US medical technology company Magnus Medical, Inc. Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems. The importance of partnerships is likely to increase in the future in the Therapy business as well, as we leverage our unique expertise and technology in emerging treatment areas. Our second strategic objective for 2025 is to successfully support the long-term collaboration between Nexstim and Brainlab and to expand our network of other partners and clinics, primarily in the United States. I strongly believe that combining Nexstim's technological expertise and first-class services with Brainlab's innovative products, which have significant business growth potential and are well suited to Nexstim's offering and global customer base of leading hospitals, will create maximum value for patients, neurosurgeons, hospitals, and shareholders. Outside of Brainlab's exclusive rights, Nexstim will continue to independently develop, market, and sell its products and services in all markets for current and future neuroscience research solutions and therapeutic applications. This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area. The gross margin target set for 2025 is EUR 4 million. The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system. The development and launch of a new product generation will continue to be an essential part of Nexstim's operations during the 2025–2028 strategy period.

CEO Mikko Karvinen comments on the development during the period: Nexstim continued its positive trend in terms of net sales growth and improved results during the first half of 2025. In H1 2025, we achieved total net sales of EUR 4.5 (3.2) million, representing growth of 41.8%. Gross margin increased by more than EUR 1 million from the comparable period last year to EUR 3.6 (2.6) million, which is a result of the favorable development of our sales volumes and prices. The increased customs duties in the United States did not have a significant impact on the results for the first half of 2025, and we have sought to minimize the potential impact of customs duties on future periods by taking them into account in new system sales offers. We were particularly pleased with the positive development of EBITDA during the first half of the year. EBITDA was EUR 0.2 (-0.5) million and was positively record-breaking for two consecutive half-years. The operating result for the first half of the year also showed improvement in the right direction, at EUR -0.2 (-0.9) million, with a result for the review period of EUR -0.3 (-0.9) million. The result was improved by a non-recurring item of EUR 0.2 million, which was the first installment of the license fee for the exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica. I thank Nexstim's customers, personnel, partners, and investors for the continuation of this positive development. In line with the main objective of Nexstim's 2025–2028 strategy, we have focused on profitable net sales growth, and our sales forecast for full year 2025 looks promising. This growth is now supported by our global distributor partner network, which was strengthened at the end of last year by the Brainlab cooperation agreement. We are now looking to take immediate advantage of this, particularly in the marketing and sales of diagnostics systems in the United States and Europe. In early 2025, we developed and trained our partner network for the Diagnostics business in close cooperation with Brainlab. This will enable us to effectively and comprehensively deliver our sales and marketing message to as many markets as possible among Brainlab's thousands of existing customers. In addition to this collaboration, Nexstim's direct sales and marketing still have significant opportunities for developing the Therapy business, research and neuroscience customers, and the clinic partner network. We aim to continue leveraging our expert and efficient global teams to ensure positive profitability development. This was reflected in the moderate 11 percent growth in operating expenses in early 2025, enabling a simultaneous 40 percent increase in gross margin. Business update We have continued to grow our Diagnostics (NBS, Navigated Brain Stimulation) and Therapy (NBT ® , Navigated Brain Therapy and NBS 6) businesses through the sale of new systems in our key markets in the US and Europe. Our growing installed base generates a steady stream of net sales which increases the stability and predictability of our operations. The Diagnostics business grew by 65.3% during the first half of 2025, with net sales of EUR 2.5 (1.5) million. We delivered a total of seven new diagnostic systems during H1 2025. To date, we have sold more than 250 diagnostic systems to research universities and leading hospitals around the world. We are pleased that more of our customers want to use Nexstim system for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The NBS System 5 configuration, NBS 5+, has enabled the use of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the same system. This offering means that all FDA 510(k) indications are available in the same system on the US market. Most of the diagnostic systems delivered in early 2025 have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We consider combination systems to be a clear competitive advantage and aim to launch the latest generation of NBS 6 combination systems in key markets during the second half of 2025, following regulatory approvals. Net sales from the therapy business decreased by 8.4% during the first half of 2025 and amounted to EUR 1.4 (1.6) million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in system sales in the Therapy business, which fell by 37.0% compared to the same period last year. During H1 2025, we delivered one purely therapeutic system to Europe and the rest of the world. This development was mainly since most of the therapy applications were delivered in connection with Diagnostics and Research and Neuroscience system. At the end of June 2025, there were a total of 116 Nexstim systems with therapy applications installed worldwide (43 in the United States and 73 in Europe and the rest of the world) for the treatment of depression and chronic neuropathic pain. This number includes both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems as well as NBS systems with optional NBT add-on software installed. With the new strategy period, we now also report separately the net sales of the Research and Neuroscience business, which grew by as much as 565.7% during the first half of 2025, amounting to EUR 0.6 (0.1) million. This rapid growth was due to the sale of two research systems and a EUR 0.2 million license fee from Sinaptica's exclusive agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned system already delivered, we had an open order backlog of eight systems at the end of June 2025. In June 2024, we announced disagreements regarding the licensing of our technology to the US medical technology company Magnus Medical, Inc. Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems. The importance of partnerships is likely to increase in the future in the Therapy business as well, as we leverage our unique expertise and technology in emerging treatment areas. Our second strategic objective for 2025 is to successfully support the long-term collaboration between Nexstim and Brainlab and to expand our network of other partners and clinics, primarily in the United States. I strongly believe that combining Nexstim's technological expertise and first-class services with Brainlab's innovative products, which have significant business growth potential and are well suited to Nexstim's offering and global customer base of leading hospitals, will create maximum value for patients, neurosurgeons, hospitals, and shareholders. Outside of Brainlab's exclusive rights, Nexstim will continue to independently develop, market, and sell its products and services in all markets for current and future neuroscience research solutions and therapeutic applications. This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area. The gross margin target set for 2025 is EUR 4 million. The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system. The development and launch of a new product generation will continue to be an essential part of Nexstim's operations during the 2025–2028 strategy period. NBS 6 is a new combination system built on Nexstim's unique, clinically established technology, with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Nexstim's NBS 6 system has FDA marketing and distribution approval for the treatment of major depression in the United States and is CE-approved in Europe for the treatment of major depression and chronic neuropathic pain. We will now continue to finalize the development of the system and progress regulatory approvals during 2025 so that, in line with our strategic objective, we will also have diagnostic applications launched in the key markets as part of the new NBS 6 system. Building future growth paths Our system clearly stands out from other TMS systems currently on the market, which do not have navigation features. In the future, the need for navigation functionality is likely to become even more important in technology, enabling more diverse treatment of brain disorders. This may open new markets for Nexstim in TMS treatments beyond severe depression and chronic neuropathic pain. The technological leadership, ease of use, and scalability of our product create an attractive foundation for growth through partnerships. In January 2025, the company announced the start of joint development of the SinaptiStim ® precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease together with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. (""Sinaptica""). The company announced that the planned delivery of the research system for the first validation testing, and future clinical trials was in March. Nexstim announced that it is developing the system according to Sinaptica's specifications, combining it with a high-resolution 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system from Bittium, which enables precision calibration of the therapy for each Alzheimer's patient. The new research system will be used in Sinaptica's upcoming clinical trials related to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with several studies planned to begin in 2025. At the end of June 2025, the Company announced that it had signed an exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. regarding the companies' planned collaboration in the field of Alzheimer's disease treatment. The signed agreement covers plans for 2025. The final agreement is expected to be drafted and signed before the end of the year. In June 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent with Sinaptica regarding the development, manufacture, and supply of Sinaptica's patented precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The system is based on Nexstim's NBS 6 medical TMS and neuronavigation systems and related software, including integrated EEG software. As part of the signed exclusive agreement, Sinaptica undertakes to order the research system it needs for clinical trials from Nexstim, and Nexstim will not commercialize its technology in the field of Alzheimer's disease independently or with partners other than Sinaptica. The agreed exclusivity is conditional upon payments of EUR 1.5 million in multiple installments to Nexstim during 2025. The planned partnership would be a global, 10-year exclusive arrangement. The financial structure of the partnership consists of a signing fee for the disclosed exclusivity rights, a milestone-based development project, and the sale of clinical and commercial system. The milestone-based project and purchases of clinical system are defined in more detail in the final agreements, which may be subject to change during negotiations. The long-term exclusive rights arrangement also depends on payments to be made by Sinaptica during 2025 and the signing of final agreements before the end of 2025. Building shareholder value while taking exceptional circumstances into account Despite the tense global political situation, our expectations for the rest of 2025 are positive in many ways. Our current business is heavily focused on the EU and the US, but with our new partners, we will continue to actively expand Nexstim's technology into the Asian market. Nexstim will continue its determined efforts to develop personalized and effective methods for the treatment and diagnosis of severe brain diseases and disorders. We strongly believe that our work will support long-term shareholder value growth in the form of increasingly strong competitive advantages, rapid growth, and improved financial results. Nexstim’s business areas Diagnostics Business Nexstim’s NBS 5 system is the only CE-marked and FDA-cleared non-invasive solution for pre-surgical mapping of the motor cortex in brain cancer. Clinical data has been generated demonstrating the value of Nexstim’s unique navigation system for pre-surgical mapping with regard to patient outcomes. The system allows surgeons to be better prepared and more aggressive with tumor resection, due to their confidence in the location of the motor and speech cortex because of pre-surgical mapping. More than 250 diagnostic systems have been sold to research universities and leading hospitals across the world. Therapy Business Nexstim’s NBT ® and NBS 6 systems are based on its unique navigated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (nTMS) technology, which allows for personalized, accurate, reproducible, and non-invasive brain stimulation. In May 2018, Nexstim launched its Navigated Brain Therapy (NBT ® ) system in the United States for the treatment of MDD, following FDA clearance in November 2017.

Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems. The importance of partnerships is likely to increase in the future in the Therapy business as well, as we leverage our unique expertise and technology in emerging treatment areas. Our second strategic objective for 2025 is to successfully support the long-term collaboration between Nexstim and Brainlab and to expand our network of other partners and clinics, primarily in the United States. I strongly believe that combining Nexstim's technological expertise and first-class services with Brainlab's innovative products, which have significant business growth potential and are well suited to Nexstim's offering and global customer base of leading hospitals, will create maximum value for patients, neurosurgeons, hospitals, and shareholders. Outside of Brainlab's exclusive rights, Nexstim will continue to independently develop, market, and sell its products and services in all markets for current and future neuroscience research solutions and therapeutic applications. This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area. The gross margin target set for 2025 is EUR 4 million. The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system. The development and launch of a new product generation will continue to be an essential part of Nexstim's operations during the 2025–2028 strategy period. NBS 6 is a new combination system built on Nexstim's unique, clinically established technology, with a modular system concept that makes it easy to add new features to existing systems. Nexstim's NBS 6 system has FDA marketing and distribution approval for the treatment of major depression in the United States and is CE-approved in Europe for the treatment of major depression and chronic neuropathic pain. We will now continue to finalize the development of the system and progress regulatory approvals during 2025 so that, in line with our strategic objective, we will also have diagnostic applications launched in the key markets as part of the new NBS 6 system. Building future growth paths Our system clearly stands out from other TMS systems currently on the market, which do not have navigation features. In the future, the need for navigation functionality is likely to become even more important in technology, enabling more diverse treatment of brain disorders. This may open new markets for Nexstim in TMS treatments beyond severe depression and chronic neuropathic pain. The technological leadership, ease of use, and scalability of our product create an attractive foundation for growth through partnerships. In January 2025, the company announced the start of joint development of the SinaptiStim ® precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease together with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. (""Sinaptica""). The company announced that the planned delivery of the research system for the first validation testing, and future clinical trials was in March. Nexstim announced that it is developing the system according to Sinaptica's specifications, combining it with a high-resolution 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system from Bittium, which enables precision calibration of the therapy for each Alzheimer's patient. The new research system will be used in Sinaptica's upcoming clinical trials related to the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, with several studies planned to begin in 2025. At the end of June 2025, the Company announced that it had signed an exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica Therapeutics, Inc. regarding the companies' planned collaboration in the field of Alzheimer's disease treatment. The signed agreement covers plans for 2025. The final agreement is expected to be drafted and signed before the end of the year. In June 2024, the Company announced that it had signed a letter of intent with Sinaptica regarding the development, manufacture, and supply of Sinaptica's patented precision neuromodulation system for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The system is based on Nexstim's NBS 6 medical TMS and neuronavigation systems and related software, including integrated EEG software. As part of the signed exclusive agreement, Sinaptica undertakes to order the research system it needs for clinical trials from Nexstim, and Nexstim will not commercialize its technology in the field of Alzheimer's disease independently or with partners other than Sinaptica. The agreed exclusivity is conditional upon payments of EUR 1.5 million in multiple installments to Nexstim during 2025. The planned partnership would be a global, 10-year exclusive arrangement. The financial structure of the partnership consists of a signing fee for the disclosed exclusivity rights, a milestone-based development project, and the sale of clinical and commercial system. The milestone-based project and purchases of clinical system are defined in more detail in the final agreements, which may be subject to change during negotiations. The long-term exclusive rights arrangement also depends on payments to be made by Sinaptica during 2025 and the signing of final agreements before the end of 2025. Building shareholder value while taking exceptional circumstances into account Despite the tense global political situation, our expectations for the rest of 2025 are positive in many ways. Our current business is heavily focused on the EU and the US, but with our new partners, we will continue to actively expand Nexstim's technology into the Asian market. Nexstim will continue its determined efforts to develop personalized and effective methods for the treatment and diagnosis of severe brain diseases and disorders. We strongly believe that our work will support long-term shareholder value growth in the form of increasingly strong competitive advantages, rapid growth, and improved financial results.

CEO Mikko Karvinen comments on the development during the period: Nexstim continued its positive trend in terms of net sales growth and improved results during the first half of 2025. In H1 2025, we achieved total net sales of EUR 4.5 (3.2) million, representing growth of 41.8%. Gross margin increased by more than EUR 1 million from the comparable period last year to EUR 3.6 (2.6) million, which is a result of the favorable development of our sales volumes and prices. The increased customs duties in the United States did not have a significant impact on the results for the first half of 2025, and we have sought to minimize the potential impact of customs duties on future periods by taking them into account in new system sales offers. We were particularly pleased with the positive development of EBITDA during the first half of the year. EBITDA was EUR 0.2 (-0.5) million and was positively record-breaking for two consecutive half-years. The operating result for the first half of the year also showed improvement in the right direction, at EUR -0.2 (-0.9) million, with a result for the review period of EUR -0.3 (-0.9) million. The result was improved by a non-recurring item of EUR 0.2 million, which was the first installment of the license fee for the exclusivity agreement with Sinaptica. I thank Nexstim's customers, personnel, partners, and investors for the continuation of this positive development. In line with the main objective of Nexstim's 2025–2028 strategy, we have focused on profitable net sales growth, and our sales forecast for full year 2025 looks promising. This growth is now supported by our global distributor partner network, which was strengthened at the end of last year by the Brainlab cooperation agreement. We are now looking to take immediate advantage of this, particularly in the marketing and sales of diagnostics systems in the United States and Europe. In early 2025, we developed and trained our partner network for the Diagnostics business in close cooperation with Brainlab. This will enable us to effectively and comprehensively deliver our sales and marketing message to as many markets as possible among Brainlab's thousands of existing customers. In addition to this collaboration, Nexstim's direct sales and marketing still have significant opportunities for developing the Therapy business, research and neuroscience customers, and the clinic partner network. We aim to continue leveraging our expert and efficient global teams to ensure positive profitability development. This was reflected in the moderate 11 percent growth in operating expenses in early 2025, enabling a simultaneous 40 percent increase in gross margin. Business update We have continued to grow our Diagnostics (NBS, Navigated Brain Stimulation) and Therapy (NBT ® , Navigated Brain Therapy and NBS 6) businesses through the sale of new systems in our key markets in the US and Europe. Our growing installed base generates a steady stream of net sales which increases the stability and predictability of our operations. The Diagnostics business grew by 65.3% during the first half of 2025, with net sales of EUR 2.5 (1.5) million. We delivered a total of seven new diagnostic systems during H1 2025. To date, we have sold more than 250 diagnostic systems to research universities and leading hospitals around the world. We are pleased that more of our customers want to use Nexstim system for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The NBS System 5 configuration, NBS 5+, has enabled the use of diagnostic and therapeutic applications in the same system. This offering means that all FDA 510(k) indications are available in the same system on the US market. Most of the diagnostic systems delivered in early 2025 have both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We consider combination systems to be a clear competitive advantage and aim to launch the latest generation of NBS 6 combination systems in key markets during the second half of 2025, following regulatory approvals. Net sales from the therapy business decreased by 8.4% during the first half of 2025 and amounted to EUR 1.4 (1.6) million. The decline was mainly due to a decrease in system sales in the Therapy business, which fell by 37.0% compared to the same period last year. During H1 2025, we delivered one purely therapeutic system to Europe and the rest of the world. This development was mainly since most of the therapy applications were delivered in connection with Diagnostics and Research and Neuroscience system. At the end of June 2025, there were a total of 116 Nexstim systems with therapy applications installed worldwide (43 in the United States and 73 in Europe and the rest of the world) for the treatment of depression and chronic neuropathic pain. This number includes both NBT ® and NBS 6 systems as well as NBS systems with optional NBT add-on software installed. With the new strategy period, we now also report separately the net sales of the Research and Neuroscience business, which grew by as much as 565.7% during the first half of 2025, amounting to EUR 0.6 (0.1) million. This rapid growth was due to the sale of two research systems and a EUR 0.2 million license fee from Sinaptica's exclusive agreement. In addition to the above-mentioned system already delivered, we had an open order backlog of eight systems at the end of June 2025. In June 2024, we announced disagreements regarding the licensing of our technology to the US medical technology company Magnus Medical, Inc. Nexstim received additional information from them regarding the launch of their first commercial product, which, based on additional analysis conducted by the Company and an external party, led to a disagreement regarding the use of the licensed technology. Nexstim continues to gather additional information regarding Magnus Medical's commercial product and is planning further measures to defend its financial interests and intellectual property rights in accordance with the long-term agreement. The Company does not currently expect to receive any royalty income from Magnus Medical during 2025 in its business forecasts. Nexstim is not currently providing an estimate of the total value of the royalty period or financial expectations due to ongoing discussions regarding the disagreements. Nexstim's cash reserves totaled EUR 2.7 (3.0) million on June 30, 2025, and cash flow from operations for the first half of the year was EUR 0.3 (0.7) million. Strategic focus remains on growth and profitability In line with our strategy for 2025–2028, Nexstim will continue to enable individualized and effective treatment and diagnostics for patients with severe brain diseases and disorders. The company's first strategic objective for 2025 is to continue profitable net sales growth and improve the operating result for the financial year. The growth and profitability of our Diagnostics and Therapy businesses play a key role in our efforts to minimize our future capital requirements on our journey towards sustained profitability. We also want to continue to highlight Research and Neuroscience as well as our clinic partners as special strategic customer groups as we progress with new features, business models, and indications for our future systems.

This includes all neuromodulation treatments that are not administered in conjunction with neurosurgical intervention using non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation. Nexstim's own sales organization, in collaboration with other distributors and business partners, will continue to work in these areas. The parties have also agreed on certain gross margin targets for payments that Nexstim will receive from the sale of its products (including maintenance agreements) in Brainlab's business area.

The EUR 2 million portion of the gross margin target allocated to the first half of 2025 was not yet fully achieved, and a gross profit insurance payment of EUR 0.1 million was recognized as part of the Diagnostics business's net sales for the period. With the expansion of the network of partner clinics, Nexstim's system will be installed in neuroscience clinics, and new investments may be made in clinic service companies in the large US market. Nexstim Investments, LLC, Nexstim's venture capital company, aims to expand Nexstim's network of partner clinics in the United States in collaboration with carefully selected leading experts in the field. We will continue to develop our cooperation model with experts, enabling the treatment of more patients in the United States with Nexstim's TMS technology. During the strategy period, we aim to increase the number of Nexstim systems and treatment sessions at our partner clinics. Our third strategic objective for 2025 is to launch the new NBS 6 diagnostic system in our main markets, enabling ease of use and future add-on modules in the same system.

VÄSENTLIGA HÄNDELSER UNDER ANDRA KVARTALET 2025 DistIT träffar en överenskommelse med bolagets obligationsägare samt annonserar avsikt att genomföra företrädesemission. Transaktionen med obligationsägarna genomförs i juli 2025. DistIT slutför överlåtelsen av majoriteten av tillgångarna i sitt helägda dotterbolag Septon Holding AB. DistIT beslutar om en företrädesemission av aktier om cirka 168 MSEK. En extra bolagsstämma hölls 12 juni med beslut om nyemission samt ändring av bolagsordningen. På årsstämman den 27 maj valdes Forvis Mazars till nya revisorer. EFUEL blir officiell distributionspartner för Tibbers hemmabatteri Homevolt. DistIT erhåller godkännande från obligationsinnehavare för implementering av refinansiering av bolagets obligation. DistIT lämnar operationell uppdatering samt offentliggör informationsdokument inför företrädesemissionen. VÄSENTLIGA HÄNDELSER EFTER PERIODENS UTGÅNG DistIT offentliggör utfall i företrädesemissionen som gjordes i samband med refinansieringen av bolagets obligation. Aurdel Sweden AB och ELKO group väljer att inte fullfölja försäljningen/köpet av Deltaco Baltics UAB. DistIT beslutar om en fullt garanterad företrädesemission om cirka 106 miljoner kronor samt offentliggör preliminär finansiell information för andra kvartalet 2025. Slutlig likvid för Septon Holding AB erhålls. VD HAR ORDET STRUKTURELLA FÖRÄNDRINGAR DistITs konsolideringsarbete, som påbörjades i april 2024, är nu i stort sett avslutat. Aurdel och EFUEL, där vi ser en potential på längre sikt, Deltaco Baltics behålls tillsvidare och övriga verksamheter har sålts. Under kvartalet har en överenskommelse slutits med DistITs obligationsägare. Överenskommelsen innebär i korthet att halva lånet, ca 137 MSEK, förlängs i tre år och den andra halvan konverteras till aktier i en nyemission. Överenskommelsen innebär att vi nu har en långsiktig finansiering av vårt obligationslån på plats samt en stark balans-räkning med väsentligt lägre skuldsättning. Försäljningen av Deltaco Baltic har skjutits på framtiden i väntan på att litauiska skattemyndighetens granskning av bolaget har slutförts. Detta beslut fattades alldeles efter andra kvartalets utgång. FINANSIELL UTVECKLING I KVARTALET DistIT omsatte 244,0 (382,3) MSEK, en nedgång med 36,2 procent vilket är hänförlig till neddragningarna och anpassningarna av sortimentet i Aurdel men även till försäljningen av verksamheten i Septon och övriga avyttrade verksamheter. Bruttomarginalen för koncernen minskade till 1,5 procent (12,6). Bruttoresultatet belastades dock av försäljningen av Septons lager samt lagerreserveringar i Aurdel med 50,9 MSEK. Rensat för dessa poster uppgick koncernens bruttomarginal till 22,4 procent. Koncernens EBITDA för kvartalet uppgick till -73,5 MSEK och justerat för ovanstående poster till -22,6 MSEK. Baserat på höstens försäljning 2024 annonserade vi för sex månader sedan en ungefärlig omsättning på 1000 MSEK med en EBITDA på 40 MSEK för 2025. Aurdels utveckling under första kvartalet stödde denna prognos, speciellt genom stark försäljning över budget av våra egna märkesvaror. Efuel tog marknadsandelar men med en elbilsförsäljning under förväntan nådde vi inte riktigt de uppsatta målen. Andra kvartalet har inneburit kraftigare försäljningsminskningar än vad Aurdel planerat baserat på sortimentsneddragningen som startade sommaren 2024 samt pga en allmänt trög marknad i skuggan av oron på världsmarknaden. Även om variationerna är stora mellan länder så tappar alla länder samt både våra Egna samt Externa märkesvaror mer försäljning än vad vi har räknat med. EFUELs andra kvartal liknar det första: svag marknad men högre marknadsandelar och bra marginal. Visserligen har vi sett förbättringar i både Aurdel och EFUEL men målen tar längre tid att nå och förbättringarna är ej tillräckliga för att vi skall kunna vidhålla vår prognos för 2025. Med stärkt likviditet ser vi betydligt bättre möjligheter inför hösten och går bättre rustade in i 2026. AURDEL Rörelseintäkterna minskade med 33,2 procent till 168,7 MSEK (252,6). Bruttomarginalen ökade till 10,1 procent (8,9) där årets kvartal påverkades negativt av lagernedskrivningar på 22,8 MSEK. Bruttomarginal justerad för dessa avsättningar blev 23,6 procent (24,9). EBIT för kvartalet uppgick till -35,5 (-62,7) MSEK. Generellt sett verkar vår satsning på Egna märkesvaror tillsammans med en sortimentsneddragning av Externa märkesvaror och substantiella kostnadsminskningar vara rätt väg. Dock arbetar vi sedan ett år med otillräcklig likviditet och har haft svårt att beställa tillräckliga volymer av de produkter som våra kunder efterfrågar. De stora inköpen av Egna märkesvaror före kinesiska nyåret gav ett starkt uppsving i försäljningen i första kvartalet men för att permanenta det krävs en stark likvid bas vilket vi ännu ej har haft. Sämre likviditet har också fört med sig sämre betalningsvillkor och i vissa fall tappade externa varumärken då vi inte kunnat beställa tillräckliga volymer. Omförhandlingen av obligationslånet stärkte förvisso balansräkningen, men gav inget likviditetstillskott. Därför har vi nu föreslagit en nyemission för att förse bolaget med den likviditet som krävs för att återigen kunna blicka framåt och växa. Sedan tull-oron i våras ser vi också att kunderna, speciellt B2C, är försiktigare med sina beställningar. Därför har vi svårare att sälja av ”gamla produkter” och kommer att bli tvungna att sänka priserna för att konvertera dessa produkter till likvida medel för nya inköp. Med en bättre likviditet ser vi positivt på framtiden. Även om vår strategiförändring inneburit minskad försäljning av Externa märkesvaror har vi fortfarande en stark efterfrågan på våra Egna märkesvaror. En positiv signal är bland annat att vi under de sista dagarna i kvartalet passerade vi 600 000 användare av appen som styr våra smart home produkter. EFUEL Rörelseintäkterna ökade med 33,2 procent till 28,5 MSEK (21,4) medan totalmarknaden för AC-laddare visar en nedgång på ca 8%. Bruttomarginalen stärktes till 17,7 procent. (11,7) och EBIT till –0,9 MSEK (-4,5). EFUEL är väl rustat för ökad lönsamhet och tillväxt. De tar marknadsandelar, fokuserar på stärkt bruttomarginal och har god kostnadskontroll. Ett nytt CRM system samt fler tillbehör i sortimentsportföljen, bland annat från Aurdel, skapar ännu större möjligheter för effektivare försäljning i framtiden. SEPTON Omsättningen för kvartalet minskade med 56,6 procent till 47 (108,3) MSEK då verksamheten såldes i slutet av april 2025. Transaktionen belastade kvartalets bruttovinst med -28,1 MSEK. Bruttomarginalen minskade till -39 procent (21,5) och EBIT uppgick till -33,1 MSEK (1,4). Slutlig likvid erhölls under augusti månad. HÅLLBARHET Vi fortsätter naturligtvis med vår bas, hållbarhetsarbetet hos våra kinesiska leverantörer. För att ligga ett steg före har vi hållit ett seminarium för våra kategorichefer om vilka ESG krav som förväntas antas av EU. Även om hållbarhetsrapporteringen CSRD nu skjutits upp och vi inte längre finns med som målgrupp kommer en hel del av våra större kunder ha de utökade kraven på sig och därigenom kräva mer ESG-data från oss. Det talas nu också mer och mer om Eco-design, att rita och tillverka produkter som är lätta att reparera och lätta att återvinna, vilket säkert kommer att påverka våra Egna märkesvaror. Här står vi väl rustade i konkurrensen, bland annat tack vare vårt inköpskontor i Kina. Detta har stor betydelse redan idag och vi är övertygade om att det kommer att utgöra en ökande konkurrensfördel framöver.

Published: 2025-08-15 07:56:57 CEST BioPorto A/S - Half Year financial report BioPorto Interim Result for the Second Quarter of 2025 - Continued progress with full execution of strategic objectives and strong NGAL sales growth. August 15, 2025 Announcement no. 19 BioPorto Interim Result for the Second Quarter of 2025 - Continued progress with full execution of strategic objectives and strong NGAL sales growth. Copenhagen, Denmark, August 15, 2025, (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) – BioPorto A/S (“BioPorto” or the “Company”) (CPH:BIOPOR), today announced interim financial results for the second quarter of 2025 and a business update. Continued progress on key strategic milestones for the second quarter of 2025 Full execution of the objectives outlined in our February 2024 Strategic Plan. A major milestone in the second quarter of 2025 was the receipt of the first purchase order for ProNephro TM AKI (NGAL) for the US market, marking the first step in the commercial launch. The enrollment of patients in the US clinical cut-off study for ProNephro AKI (NGAL) for adult use is progressing as planned and is reaching the final phase. We maintain our goal to submit to the FDA by the end of 2026. Strong NGAL sales growth of 39% compared to the second quarter of 2024. The Board was restructured with Jens Due Olsen stepping in as Chairman and Carsten Buhl appointed as new CEO as of September 1, to drive the next growth phase. On April 15, 2025, the Company successfully completed a funding round of 25,000,000 new shares in a direct issue at market price providing gross proceeds of DKK 33.5 million. The funding round was met with strong support from existing shareholders. Peter Mørch Eriksen, BioPorto’s Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO), comments: “The second quarter of 2025 marked a pivotal chapter for BioPorto, with the first US order of ProNephro AKI (NGAL) initiating our commercial journey and laying the foundation for a commercial platform to drive broad adoption of ProNephro AKI through strategic partnerships. We are pleased with the strong market momentum in the US and the progress in clinical studies toward the FDA submission by the end of 2026. With a clearly defined strategy and new leadership, we are well positioned to move into the next phase of our growth journey.” Financial highlights for the second quarter of 2025 Total revenue in the second quarter of 2025 totaled DKK 10.6 million, representing a 15% increase compared to the same period last year. This growth was driven by rising NGAL sales in both the US and the rest of the world (ROW). NGAL sales increased by 39% compared to the second quarter of 2024, driven by a 23% increase in the US and a substantial growth of 71% in the ROW, primarily due to a bulk order. EBITDA loss in the second quarter of 2025 amounted to DKK 18.4 million compared to DKK 16.2 million in the second quarter last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher costs associated with the adult clinical study. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s cash position was DKK 47.8 million compared to DKK 103.9 million in the same period last year. For the first half of 2025 total revenue amounted to DKK 18.3 million, representing a 2% decrease compared to the same period last year, primarily driven by lower Antibody sales due to timing in orders. NGAL sales rose by 5% compared to the first half of 2024, driven by a 22% increase in US NGAL sales. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 46.5 million, compared to DKK 31.5 million in the same period last year. Guidance Based on the results for the first half of 2025 and better visibility for the remainder of 2025, we narrow the full-year guidance for 2025. Total revenue is expected to be in the range of DKK 45-50 million (previously DKK 45-60 million). Sales for the rest of 2025 are still expected to be back-end loaded. Adjusted EBITDA loss is expected to be in the range of DKK 75-80 million (previously DKK 75-85 million).

Comparable EBIT is expected to be EUR 85–105 million. TOKMANNI GROUP CEO MIKA RAUTIAINEN During the second quarter of 2025, Tokmanni Group’s revenue grew, driven especially by Dollarstore’s strong performance in non-grocery sales. Dollarstore segment’s revenue grew by 8.8% in local currencies, with like-for-like revenue up by 5.1%. Tokmanni segment’s like-for-like revenue grew by 0.8%, mainly due to higher sales of groceries and Easter products, while demand for spring and summer season products was weak. Nevertheless, customer visits increased across Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. The development of Tokmanni Group’s gross margin was twofold. We succeeded in improving Dollarstore segment’s gross margin after a weak first quarter, with comparable gross profit rising by EUR 5.0 million compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, Tokmanni segment’s comparable gross margin declined by 1.4 percentage points. The decline was mainly due to decreased sales of higher-margin non-grocery sales, particularly spring and summer season products and increased share of grocery sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. We were not able to manage our operating expenses in line with our targets. As a result, fixed costs in both segments increased faster than revenue, largely due to higher personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel costs were driven up by wage increases, new store openings, and increased working hours partly because of the harmonisation of replenishment and warehouse management systems at the Group level. The Group’s weaker result compared to the corresponding period of the previous year was mainly due to these increased operating expenses and the lower gross margin percentage mentioned earlier. Measures to improve profitability at Tokmanni and Dollarstore are proceeding.

Comparable EBIT is expected to be EUR 85–105 million. TOKMANNI GROUP CEO MIKA RAUTIAINEN During the second quarter of 2025, Tokmanni Group’s revenue grew, driven especially by Dollarstore’s strong performance in non-grocery sales. Dollarstore segment’s revenue grew by 8.8% in local currencies, with like-for-like revenue up by 5.1%. Tokmanni segment’s like-for-like revenue grew by 0.8%, mainly due to higher sales of groceries and Easter products, while demand for spring and summer season products was weak. Nevertheless, customer visits increased across Finland, Sweden, and Denmark. The development of Tokmanni Group’s gross margin was twofold. We succeeded in improving Dollarstore segment’s gross margin after a weak first quarter, with comparable gross profit rising by EUR 5.0 million compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. On the other hand, Tokmanni segment’s comparable gross margin declined by 1.4 percentage points. The decline was mainly due to decreased sales of higher-margin non-grocery sales, particularly spring and summer season products and increased share of grocery sales compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. We were not able to manage our operating expenses in line with our targets. As a result, fixed costs in both segments increased faster than revenue, largely due to higher personnel and marketing expenses. Personnel costs were driven up by wage increases, new store openings, and increased working hours partly because of the harmonisation of replenishment and warehouse management systems at the Group level. The Group’s weaker result compared to the corresponding period of the previous year was mainly due to these increased operating expenses and the lower gross margin percentage mentioned earlier. Measures to improve profitability at Tokmanni and Dollarstore are proceeding. These actions include strict cost control, particularly regarding personnel and marketing expenses, as well as efforts to enhance the efficiency of supply chain and store operations. We are also continuing the integration of Dollarstore into Tokmanni Group. In addition, we continue to develop our store network in Finland, Sweden, and Denmark.

KH-Koneet’s net sales increased and operating profit decreased. The machine dealership and rental business grew in Finland in terms of both net sales and operating profit. In Sweden, the machine rental business, in particular, generated lower net sales and operating profit than in the comparison period. Sales of heavy crawler excavators in Finland continued to increase year-on-year. Nordic Rescue Group’s net sales declined, but operating profit for the second quarter was on a par with the comparison period. The order book strengthened during the review period in both Finland and Sweden. KH Group announced in March 2025 that it had initiated a sale process for Indoor Group. KH Group has engaged a financial advisor to explore various options for its Indoor Group shareholding. No final decision has been made on the sale of Indoor Group holdings and there is no certainty as to the timing, terms or completion of any such transaction. KH Group aims to complete the process during 2025. In Indoor Group, the general uncertainty in the market continued to have a negative impact on net sales and operating profit. The extensive operating model reform programme to improve Indoor Group’s profitability targets an annual improvement in operating profit of at least EUR 10 million by the end of 2026. A significant part of the targeted profitability improvement is estimated to be realised already during 2025. The change negotiations concluded in December 2024 will generate annual savings in wage costs of approximately EUR 6–7 million, which improved the company's result significantly in the second quarter. In June 2025, Indoor Group carried out change negotiations related to the renewal of the management model and the reorganisation of functions. The aim was to identify measures to improve profitability by approximately EUR 2 million per year. The outcome of the change negotiations was that up to 21 employment relationships will be terminated in Indoor Group, and temporary lay-offs will be implemented by the end of May 2026. In March 2025, KH Group acquired the remaining KH-Koneet Group Oy minority shares in accordance with the shareholder agreement. As a result, KH-Koneet is now a fully-owned subsidiary of KH Group Plc. In May, the Board of Directors of KH Group Plc resolved to establish a performance share plan for KH-Koneet's key employees. The plan replaced the performance-based matching share plan announced on 31 May 2024. The purpose of the new scheme is to align the goals of shareholders and key employees in order to increase the company's shareholder value in the long term, guide the key employees to achieve the company’s strategic objectives, and offer them a competitive incentive scheme based on the earning and accrual of KH Group shares. In 2025, the business areas will focus on securing net sales and operating profit as well as improving the efficiency of working capital. KH Group’s change in strategy is being advanced according to plan.""

Financial objectives and future outlook KH Group’s objective is to become an industrial group built around the KH-Koneet business and to divest other business areas in line with the Group's strategy. At the same time, active developments will continue regarding other business areas. Exit planning and the assessment of exit opportunities for the other business areas will also continue. During the next few years, the aim is to invest in the growth of the core business and pay dividends after significant exits within the limits established by the balance sheet structure and financing agreements. The guidance with the current Group structure of continuing operations for 2025 is as follows: the company estimates that both the net sales (EUR 194.0 million) and the comparable operating profit (EUR 7.2 million) will remain approximately at the same level year-on-year.

Q2 2025 organic growth ended at 8%. Like-for-like (LFL) was 3% and network expansion added 5% to growth. LFL growth in the US remained strong at 8%, and Rest of Pandora was robust at 6%. Despite some challenges in the four European markets disclosed separately, overall LFL in Europe was 1% fuelled by double-digit growth in several countries, including for example Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Poland. The gross margin remained strong at 79.3% despite 170bp headwind from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs (80.2% in Q2 2024). Pricing and cost efficiencies continued to contribute positively. The Q2 2025 EBIT margin landed at 18.2%. The margin declined by 160bp Y/Y reflecting 230bp of headwinds from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs. In constant currency, the EBIT margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025. Reported EPS growth in Q2 2025 was 6% (18% in constant currency). PHOENIX STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS To position Pandora as a full jewellery brand, Pandora continues to invest across all four strategy pillars: brand, design, markets and personalisation. A number of key strategic initiatives are lined up for H2 2025, including an exciting product pipeline with two new collections, Pandora Talisman and Minis, that refresh the core charms & carriers offering with new styles whilst also strengthening the affordability position. Pandora is preparing a new chapter of the “BE LOVE” marketing campaign with a holiday campaign that deepens emotional connection through storytelling, anchored in Pandora’s brand DNA. Additionally, in selected markets, Pandora will invest behind locally relevant talent, strengthening cultural resonance and boosting social engagement to inspire consumers. Pandora’s full jewellery brand message continues to resonate with consumers and is visible in the numbers with LFL growth in the “Core” segment in Q2 of 1% whilst the “Fuel with more” segment drove 5% LFL growth. Despite 30bp further headwind from commodity prices and foreign exchange since the Q1 2025 report, Pandora remains on track towards the target of an EBIT margin of “around 25%” in 2026 (excl. tariffs). The current tariff level adds 120bp headwind in 2026 and Pandora currently expects to deliver “at least 24%” EBIT margin incl. tariffs. 2025 GUIDANCE AND CURRENT TRADING Pandora maintains the guidance for 2025 of “7-8% organic growth” while noting the elevated macro uncertainty. The EBIT margin guidance for 2025 is also maintained at “around 24%” despite including the 60bp headwind based on current tariff levels. Current trading in July has seen LFL growth at around 2%. This has been negatively impacted by a) a weak End of Season Sale and b) the timing of product launches with PANDORA ESSENCE being launched in May 2024 while Talisman/Minis will be launched at the end of Q3 2025. Alexander Lacik, President and CEO of Pandora, says: “In these turbulent times, we are satisfied with yet another quarter of high single-digit organic growth and strong profitability.

Q2 2025 organic growth ended at 8%. Like-for-like (LFL) was 3% and network expansion added 5% to growth. LFL growth in the US remained strong at 8%, and Rest of Pandora was robust at 6%. Despite some challenges in the four European markets disclosed separately, overall LFL in Europe was 1% fuelled by double-digit growth in several countries, including for example Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Poland. The gross margin remained strong at 79.3% despite 170bp headwind from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs (80.2% in Q2 2024). Pricing and cost efficiencies continued to contribute positively. The Q2 2025 EBIT margin landed at 18.2%. The margin declined by 160bp Y/Y reflecting 230bp of headwinds from foreign exchange, commodities and tariffs. In constant currency, the EBIT margin was 19.4% in Q2 2025. Reported EPS growth in Q2 2025 was 6% (18% in constant currency). PHOENIX STRATEGY HIGHLIGHTS To position Pandora as a full jewellery brand, Pandora continues to invest across all four strategy pillars: brand, design, markets and personalisation. A number of key strategic initiatives are lined up for H2 2025, including an exciting product pipeline with two new collections, Pandora Talisman and Minis, that refresh the core charms & carriers offering with new styles whilst also strengthening the affordability position. Pandora is preparing a new chapter of the “BE LOVE” marketing campaign with a holiday campaign that deepens emotional connection through storytelling, anchored in Pandora’s brand DNA. Additionally, in selected markets, Pandora will invest behind locally relevant talent, strengthening cultural resonance and boosting social engagement to inspire consumers. Pandora’s full jewellery brand message continues to resonate with consumers and is visible in the numbers with LFL growth in the “Core” segment in Q2 of 1% whilst the “Fuel with more” segment drove 5% LFL growth. Despite 30bp further headwind from commodity prices and foreign exchange since the Q1 2025 report, Pandora remains on track towards the target of an EBIT margin of “around 25%” in 2026 (excl. tariffs). The current tariff level adds 120bp headwind in 2026 and Pandora currently expects to deliver “at least 24%” EBIT margin incl. tariffs. 2025 GUIDANCE AND CURRENT TRADING Pandora maintains the guidance for 2025 of “7-8% organic growth” while noting the elevated macro uncertainty. The EBIT margin guidance for 2025 is also maintained at “around 24%” despite including the 60bp headwind based on current tariff levels. Current trading in July has seen LFL growth at around 2%. This has been negatively impacted by a) a weak End of Season Sale and b) the timing of product launches with PANDORA ESSENCE being launched in May 2024 while Talisman/Minis will be launched at the end of Q3 2025. Alexander Lacik, President and CEO of Pandora, says: “In these turbulent times, we are satisfied with yet another quarter of high single-digit organic growth and strong profitability. The results show that our brand and unique storytelling proposition continue to attract more consumers and that our global footprint enables us to balance ups and downs across the markets.

Ongoing shifts in consumer trends and unusually poor weather in May and June negatively affected sales across several of our traditionally strong categories. In the Nordic markets, total sales volume declined by 1.8%, with spirits posting modest growth of 0.1%, while wine saw a decline of 2.1%. Despite the challenging market environment, the second quarter also brought several positive developments. We maintained strong cost control, resulting in reduced operating expenses. In Sweden, our targeted wine campaigns delivered promising results, and in Finland, we saw encouraging traction from new launches in the no- and low-alcohol categories. Koskenkorva continued to perform well, particularly within the liqueur and ready-to-drink segments. We were pleased to see our gross margin reaching 42.6% of net sales, supported by improvements in the Spirits and Industrial segments. As always, we remain agile in responding to market conditions and are prepared to adjust our cost base as needed. In the second quarter, our comparable EBITDA decreased by 8.3% and amounted to EUR 14.0 (15.2) million or 8.4% (8.6%) of net sales, mainly driven by the lower net sales. Comparable EBITDA increased in the Industrial segment from the previous year, while in the Wine and Spirits segments comparable EBITDA decreased. We achieved some cost reductions in the Industrial and Spirits segments. In the Industrial segment, efficiency improvement in the supply chain successfully increased profitability. Net sales in the second quarter declined by 6.6% to EUR 165.5 million, primarily due to lower volumes in the Wine and Spirits segments. In the Wine segment , Anora maintained its overall market leadership in the Nordics overall, including grocery retail, thanks to the successful introduction of low-ABV wines in Finnish grocery stores last year. In the second quarter, we also improved our market share in Sweden. The decline in the Wine segment’s net sales was driven by lower demand and increased price competition of filler services in Denmark, and weaker wine sales especially in Norway. In the Spirits segment , market shares declined across our main countries, with Norway in particular experiencing weak performance. The net sales decrease in the Spirits segment was explained mainly by the recently lost partners . The Industrial segment's net sales increase was mostly driven by phasing of contract manufacturing volumes, offset by lower volumes of other product categories as well as side product sales prices. At the end of the quarter our cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 126.7 million. Our interest-bearing net debt amounted to EUR 199.1 (200.7) million, while our net interest-bearing debt / comparable EBITDA ratio was 3.0 (2.8). After my first full quarter as CEO, my confidence in the potential in our business – our strong brands, innovation ability, and our talented people – has only grown stronger. I want to thank our customers and partners for their trust and our employees for their continued dedication. We still have hard work ahead to reach our goals, which is why we are not only accelerating actions to improve our financial performance but also beginning to update our strategy to guide us through to 2028. Our work on an updated strategy for the next strategy period will be divided into the following phases: Fit & Fix and Focus. The Fit & Fix phases deliver short and mid-term performance improvement over 2025-2026, while the Focus drives growth initiatives as of 2026 onwards. I look forward to sharing more about this at our upcoming Capital Markets Day in Helsinki on 5 November 2025 – you are warmly welcome! ” Outlook and guidance for 2025 Market outlook In 2025, our key markets are expected to be relatively flat compared to the 2024 levels both in volumes and in value terms. Guidance In 2025, Anora’s comparable EBITDA is expected to be EUR 70-75 million (2024: EUR 68.9 million).

Highlights DKK 8.5bn revenue – a 2% decrease DKK 706m EBITDA – a 4% decrease DKK 542m cash flow from operations – a 61% improvement DKK 10.18 earnings per share – a 3% decrease 12.5% ROIC excluding goodwill – a 1.3 pp decrease Full-year revenue and EBITDA guidance narrowed within previous range. Statement by Jens Bjerg Sørensen, President of Schouw & Co. – Schouw & Co. experienced a challenging yet stable second quarter of 2025, with consolidated revenue and EBITDA slightly down on the second quarter of 2024. The diversified portfolio provided stability amid global economic changes, particularly in Chinese export markets. Despite the global challenges, we generated a solid operational cash flow of DKK 542 million. Especially BioMar, GPV and HydraSpecma showed continued solid resilience, while Borg Automotive faced difficult market conditions. We maintain a positive outlook, narrowing our full-year 2025 guidance within the previously announced range. We have previously announced that we are investigating whether a potential separate listing of BioMar would create value for the shareholders of Schouw & Co. The preparatory work continued as expected during the past quarter, and a banking syndicate has been established. If found to be value-creating, the listing of BioMar on the Copenhagen stock exchange can take place in the first half of 2026 .

EBITDA was DKK 9.7m, a 23% YoY decrease. EBT was DKK 4.0m, a 50% YoY decrease. Unique paying users (UPU) were 222,158, a 17% YoY increase. Total transactions were 638,570, a 20% YoY increase. Total installs were 16.9m, a 114% YoY increase. Q2 Revenue was DKK 23.6m, a 7.5% YoY decrease. EBITDA was DKK 3.5m, a 55% YoY decrease. EBT was DKK 0.03m, a 99% YoY decrease. Unique paying users (UPU) were 137,457, a 18% YoY increase. Total transactions were 347,268, a 17% YoY increase. Total installs were 7.8m, a 60% YoY increase. Building Momentum The second quarter of 2025 was marked by strong operational focus, delivering results in line with expectations while laying the groundwork for accelerated growth in the second half of the year. Activities intensified from mid-May, with the scale-up of Truck Manager , followed by the late-June release of Farm Manager . While these milestones had only a limited direct impact on Q2 Financials, they have already had a clear effect on top-funnel KPIs creating a clear shift in momentum. July 2025 thus marked a historic milestone with revenue of DKK 10.7 million - the highest in company history. The early scaling of both titles is already exceeding expectations, building powerful momentum and positioning Trophy Games for a record-breaking second half of the year. Temporary Pressures for Long-Term Gains In Q2, we invested DKK 2 million more in marketing compared to last year, primarily to launch campaigns for Truck Manager and Farm Manager. As these campaigns began late in the quarter, the cost impact was immediate, while the revenue benefit will materialise in Q3 and beyond. It’s worth noting that Q2 2024 benefited from an exceptional - but temporary - boost in iOS marketing payback, with campaigns performing three times above normal levels . This one-off advantage makes year-on-year comparisons less straightforward. In addition, a weakened USD - down nearly 15% since January - impacted both our revenue and operating profit as more than half of our sales are directly or indirectly influenced by movements in the USD. We also faced a one-time financial expense of DKK 990 thousand in tax interest payments, due to the Danish Tax Authority’s retrospective withdrawal of the Tax Credit Scheme (Skattekreditordningen) for software development. This ruling impacted thousands of Danish IT companies. For Trophy Games, the impact is a short-term liquidity drain, but we expect to offset this through tax loss carryforward already in the 2025 income year. The combination of these factors, along with our ability to scale marketing faster than initially projected, led to a temporary pause of the share buyback program in Q2. With marketing campaigns typically breaking even within six months, even modest monthly increases in spend can significantly influence liquidity in the short term. Stronger Outlook Driven by Early Success Our focus on Truck Manager and Farm Manager is already reshaping our KPIs. From installs to active engagement and paying user numbers, these two titles have delivered a notable uplift. Updated figures including July clearly show a stronger Q3 outlook compared to Q2. This acceleration in topline growth is why we chose to revise our guidance early and share preliminary figures that include July and early August. The Ranchers Our French studio partner Redpilz is working intensively to complete the first public demo of The Ranchers . Once ready, the sequence will be: demo release, participation in Steam’s Next Fest , followed by an Early Access launch . For a premium PC title, day-one quality is critical - there is no margin for a “soft” launch. That’s why polishing and player testing are non-negotiable. The demo is arriving later than planned, introducing uncertainty around the release date. To safeguard quality, we have removed The Ranchers from our current guidance. The release is approaching, but we will not compromise on delivering a first-class player experience. Positioned for a Record-Breaking H2 2025 With two high-potential titles scaling rapidly , KPIs moving sharply upward, and July already delivering a company-record revenue, Trophy Games enters the second half of 2025 with an exciting outlook. While short-term liquidity has been impacted by targeted investments in development, marketing and one-off expenses, these actions are designed to secure sustainable, scalable growth . Our strategy remains focused: invest decisively in our most promising titles, ensure quality in all releases, and build long-term shareholder value. As these initiatives bear fruit, we see compelling upside ahead - both for our games and for our investors. Thank you for your continued support.

EBITDA was down by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million, and profit before tax (EBT) was down by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million. As announced on 10 July 2025, our full-year revenue guidance for 2025 has been lowered to a range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%), while our earnings margin guidance is maintained at an EBITDA margin of 19-21% and an EBT margin of 11-13%. We therefore expect to achieve revenue and earnings at the same level as the record year of 2024. The Board of Directors of SP Group A/S today considered and approved the interim report for the six months ended 30 June 2025, which includes the following highlights (all changes are calculated in relation to the first half of 2024): Revenue fell by 1.2% to DKK 1,466.9 million in H1. Revenue for Q2 was down by 10.7% year on year. Earnings before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined by 3.7% to DKK 291.1 million in H1 for an EBITDA margin of 19.8%. EBITDA for Q2 was down by 18.8% to DKK 124.8 million for an EBITDA margin of 18.3%. Profit before tax (EBT) fell by 6.7% to DKK 164.7 million in H1 for an EBT margin of 11.2%. EBT for Q2 was down by 30.6% to DKK 63.6 million for an EBT margin of 9.4%. H1 sales of own products declined by 11.5% to DKK 388.4 million. Own products accounted for 26.5% of revenue for the period. Sales of other products grew in H1, while Healthcare, Foodtech and Cleantech suffered a setback. Cash flows from operating activities were a net inflow of DKK 228.7 million in H1 against DKK 256.6 million in the year-earlier period. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) was DKK 756.9 million at 30 June 2025, compared to DKK 923.8 million at 30 June 2024. At 31 December 2024, NIBD amounted to DKK 821.1 million. NIBD was 1.3x LTM EBITDA. NIBD fell by DKK 64.2 million in H1 2025. SP Meditec is nearing completion of its production ramp-up in Peachtree City, near Atlanta, USA. Due to a high number of customer projects, we are currently exploring options to expand production capacity further. In Poland, we have initiated the conversion of one of our factory buildings for the manufacturing of components for medical devices. Ergomat has successfully launched new sales activities in Asia, including in key markets such as India and Japan. We expect only marginal impact from a new US–EU trade agreement. SP Group expects revenue growth for FY 2025 in the range of -3% to +3% (previously +3% to +10%) for an EBITDA margin of 19-21%. Lars Bering, CEO: “ Following a record-breaking first quarter in terms of revenue and earnings, SP Group generated lower-than-expected sales and earnings in the second quarter of 2025 due to the postponement of several orders and projects during the period. The Q2 performance was impacted by ongoing geopolitical unrest, leading to increased uncertainty in global markets with several of our customers postponing the launch of new projects. However, we are pleased to see increased activity in the defence industry, which has led to several exciting projects for SP. Our subsupplier production grew in the course of H1 2025, as did the inflow of medical device industry projects, resulting in high activity levels at our US factory and the factories in Europe. ” For further information: CEO Lars Bering Phone: +45 70 23 23 79 Invitation: Presentation of interim report for the first half of 2025 In continuation of the release of this interim report, SP Group will host a webcast on 20 August 2025 at 1:00 p.m. (in Danish) and at 3:00 p.m. (in English).

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year. Free cash flow in Q2 was DKK 32 million, compared to DKK 26 million in Q2 2024. This improvement was driven by higher earnings and an improvement in the net working capital. CAPEX amounted to DKK 18.3 million (Q2 2024: DKK 12.0 million), mainly related to the ERP project and the new lacquering facility. The lacquering facility was completed during the quarter and is expected to ramp up fully during the present quarter. After acquiring 45% of the online retailer Celebert ApS in 2021, we have now agreed to acquire the remaining 55% following the decision of the majority shareholder to exercise its put option. During the four years of co-ownership, Celebert has grown rapidly, and we are confident that, once the relevant regulatory approvals are in place, Celebert will continue this growth journey. Considering the results from the first six months of the year and the development in order intake during Q2, we are narrowing our guidance for 2025. TCM Group now expects full-year revenue in the range of DKK 1,250–1,300 million (previously DKK 1,250 – 1,325 million) and adjusted EBIT of DKK 90–110 million (previously DKK 90-115 million). As previously communicated, this guidance assumes full ownership of Celebert toward the end of the year.]” Financial highlights Q2 2025 Revenue DKK 349.1 million (DKK 332.2 million), corresponding to a growth of 5.1% Adjusted EBITDA DKK 42.6 million (DKK 36.7 million).

CEO Torben Paulin: “Sales in the second quarter developed broadly in line with our expectations, with growth in both the B2B and B2C segments, following the solid order intake in the first quarter of 2025. Total sales for the quarter increased by 5% year-on-year to DKK 349 million, with organic growth of 3%. Order intake slowed in the second quarter, despite a continued overall positive development in the B2C segment. Especially in the second half of the quarter, activity in the B2C segment began to show signs of fatigue, in line with macroeconomic reports indicating weakening consumer confidence and a slowdown in retail spending. In the B2B segment, project orders in Q2 declined as expected, while orders from housebuilders showed a positive trend. The gross margin increased to 23.7% in Q2, up from 21.5% in Q2 2024, primarily due to higher average selling prices and stable input costs during the quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased by 20%, from DKK 28.0 million in Q2 2024 to DKK 33.6 million, corresponding to an adjusted EBIT margin of 9.6%, compared to 8.4% in the same period last year. Free cash flow in Q2 was DKK 32 million, compared to DKK 26 million in Q2 2024. This improvement was driven by higher earnings and an improvement in the net working capital. CAPEX amounted to DKK 18.3 million (Q2 2024: DKK 12.0 million), mainly related to the ERP project and the new lacquering facility. The lacquering facility was completed during the quarter and is expected to ramp up fully during the present quarter. After acquiring 45% of the online retailer Celebert ApS in 2021, we have now agreed to acquire the remaining 55% following the decision of the majority shareholder to exercise its put option. During the four years of co-ownership, Celebert has grown rapidly, and we are confident that, once the relevant regulatory approvals are in place, Celebert will continue this growth journey. Considering the results from the first six months of the year and the development in order intake during Q2, we are narrowing our guidance for 2025. TCM Group now expects full-year revenue in the range of DKK 1,250–1,300 million (previously DKK 1,250 – 1,325 million) and adjusted EBIT of DKK 90–110 million (previously DKK 90-115 million).

Reported revenue in DKK grew 1% with negative impact from currencies and the Skin Care divestment. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy. Growth in Advanced Wound Dressings was -2%, driven primarily by a significant decline in China which was impacted by a preventative and voluntary product return of all Biatain® Adhesive foam dressings in the market. The product return is expected to have a negative revenue impact of around DKK 80 million in H2, of which around DKK 20 million impacted Q3. Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3. EBIT 1 was DKK 1,915 million, a 2% increase from last year. The EBIT margin 1,2 was 28%, against 27% last year.

Reported revenue in DKK grew 1% with negative impact from currencies and the Skin Care divestment. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy. Growth in Advanced Wound Dressings was -2%, driven primarily by a significant decline in China which was impacted by a preventative and voluntary product return of all Biatain® Adhesive foam dressings in the market. The product return is expected to have a negative revenue impact of around DKK 80 million in H2, of which around DKK 20 million impacted Q3. Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3.

Reported revenue in DKK grew 1% with negative impact from currencies and the Skin Care divestment. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 4% and Interventional Urology 4%. Growth in Ostomy Care was driven by broad-based contribution across regions, except for China which delivered low-single digit growth, as expected. Growth in Continence Care was driven by continued strong contribution from the Luja™ portfolio. Voice and Respiratory Care growth was driven by continued good momentum in both Laryngectomy and Tracheostomy. Growth in Advanced Wound Dressings was -2%, driven primarily by a significant decline in China which was impacted by a preventative and voluntary product return of all Biatain® Adhesive foam dressings in the market. The product return is expected to have a negative revenue impact of around DKK 80 million in H2, of which around DKK 20 million impacted Q3. Kerecis grew 17%, with a 13% EBIT margin before PPA amortisation. Growth in the quarter was impacted by a slowdown in the out-patient setting due to the LCD postponement in April, causing a temporary market shift to high-priced products. Growth momentum in Q4 is expected to improve, with a good start to the quarter in July. Growth in Interventional Urology was driven by good momentum in the US Men’s Health business, partly offset by continued negative impact from the product recall in Bladder Health and Surgery of around DKK -10 million in Q3. EBIT 1 was DKK 1,915 million, a 2% increase from last year. The EBIT margin 1,2 was 28%, against 27% last year. Changes to the Executive Leadership Team announced, to support the successful execution of the new company strategy towards 2030. 9M 2024/25 organic growth of 7% and EBIT margin 1 of 27%. Reported revenue in DKK grew 4% to DKK 20,914 million. Organic growth rates by business area: Ostomy Care 6%, Continence Care 8%, Voice and Respiratory Care 9%, Advanced Wound Care 9% and Interventional Urology 1%. EBIT 1 was DKK 5,718 million, a 4% increase from last year. The EBIT margin 1 was 27%, on par with last year 2 . Adjusted 3 net profit before special items was DKK 3,778 million, a DKK 15 million decrease from last year, negatively impacted by non-cash effect from net financial expenses. Adjusted 3 diluted earnings per share (EPS) before special items decreased by 1% to DKK 16.76. Adjusted 3 ROIC after tax before special items was 15%, on par with last year. FY 2024/25 guidance is unchanged with organic growth of around 7% and an EBIT margin before special items of 27-28%. Organic growth now includes the negative impact from the product return in Advanced Wound Dressings in China, partly offset by good momentum in the other business areas. Reported growth in DKK is now expected to be 3-4%, with around 2%-points negative impact from currencies and around 1.5%-points negative impact from the Skin Care divestment. The assumptions on the reported EBIT margin before special items are largely unchanged. Special items expectations are unchanged, around DKK 450 million. Expectations on capital expenditures and tax rate (ordinary and effective) are also unchanged. ""We deliver a third quarter as expected with 7% organic growth and an EBIT margin of 28%, maintaining our financial guidance for 2024/25. Our Q3 performance was driven by broad-based growth across our chronic care businesses, offsetting the challenges in China. I’m pleased to see the global Coloplast organisation continuing to deliver on our priorities and moving the business forward. The search for Coloplast’s new CEO remains on track.

Guidance for 2025 (changed 18 August 2025) Netum estimates its revenue in the financial year 2025 to be in the range of EUR 37–41 million and comparable EBITA to be 4–7% of revenue. Previous guidance: Netum estimates its revenue in the financial year 2025 to be in the range of EUR 41–46 million and comparable EBITA to be 7–10% of revenue. The changed guidance is based on the very unclear market situation, slower than expected wins of sales and delayed project starts, which have not been able to compensate for the previously anticipated completion of a few large projects at the end of the summer. The changes in the Group apply especially to Netum Oy and Buutti Oy. Netum estimates that the demand for IT in public service will remain stable, but the fierce price competition will weaken the profitability of the projects. In the private sector, the opportunities are good if uncertainty eases, and investments pick up. The outlook remains unclear, and we will assess the necessary operational and structural changes during the autumn. Repe Harmanen, CEO: “The first half of the year was challenging for our business. Falling short of the sales targets for the first half of the year was reflected in both revenue and profit. Our revenue in January–June was EUR 21.4 (22.8) million and comparable EBITA was EUR 1.7 (2.3) million, or 7.8% (10.1%). The continued uncertainty in the market and the slowdown in investments have forced us to take several measures to safeguard profitability. We will monitor the adequacy of the measures and strengthen our resilience with determination. During the first half of the year, Netum Ltd carried out change negotiations, which ended on 18 June 2025. The measures implemented as a result of the negotiations will improve our cost efficiency and adapt our operations to the market situation. The personnel reductions are estimated to result in about EUR 1.9 million of permanent savings on an annual basis, but their impact will not be fully visible until 2026. EUR 0.1 million of the costs of implementing the change negotiations has been taken into account in the comparable EBITA for the second quarter, and the remaining EUR 0.2 million will be allocated to the third quarter of the year. At the same time, we have secured new customers and projects that will start in the autumn and support our future growth. During the summer, the largest tenders won were the construction and maintenance of the farm relief system for the Farmers' Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Mela) (estimated at EUR 4 million, 7 years) and expert services for the development of railway information systems for the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency (estimated at EUR 1.6 million, 3 + 2 years). During the first half of the year, Buutti’s business in particular clearly fell short of its targets, which had the most significant impact on our revenue and profit. Studyo’s business was in line with the targets. Despite Netum Ltd’s add-on sales and profits from new projects, we are still behind our sales target for this year. It is of primary importance for us to continue to be successful in tenders in the near future in order to compensate for the decline in our revenue and profitability caused by significant ending projects. For example, the transfer of employment services from the central government to municipalities required extensive development projects and the parallel use of systems. We played a significant role in the project, both in system development and production. Following successful deployments in the first half of the year, we will continue as the vendor in the same roles, but with a smaller volume during the rest of the year. I have met several of our customers from different sectors. The meetings have highlighted confidence in our ability to implement business-critical solutions even in an uncertain market. Our customers particularly appreciate the high level of expertise of our experts and the transparency of our solutions - these factors set us apart in the intense competition. Our people have demonstrated excellent commitment and flexibility in the midst of change. I would like to thank everyone at Netum for their high-quality work and for building our future competitiveness. I wish all the best to those who were involved in the change negotiations and believe that there is a shared understanding of the company’s situation. Competence development and the wellbeing of our personnel will continue to be the foundation of our long-term success. Our strategically important AI project is progressing as planned, and we have seen a growing demand for AI solutions that reform processes. In line with our Wise Changemaker mindset, we help customers to leverage AI in existing systems and build new digital capabilities, strengthening our position as a responsible and long-term IT partner. Our sustainability programme and the preparation of the CSRD project are progressing according to schedule. For us, sustainability is about practical actions and transparent communication that support the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders. We estimate that the demand for IT services will continue at the current level, but the fierce price competition will continue to challenge sufficient margin levels. The fast-paced nature of Buutti Oy's expert services may have a faster impact for the numbers of the rest of the year than Netum Ltd's business model. The current market environment requires close monitoring and flexibility. We are prepared to take the necessary measures if the market situation changes substantially or if the start of projects deviates from the current forecast. We will continue our determined work on profitability and growth in Finland and in accordance with our strategy in the Nordic countries. I would like to express my warmest thanks to our customers, employees and other stakeholders.” For further information, please contact: Netum Group Plc Repe Harmanen, CEO +358 400 467 717 Mari Ala-Sorvari, Head of external reporting and IR +358 50 494 9930 Certified Adviser: Evli Plc +358 40 579 6210 Netum Group Plc Netum is an IT service partner that builds a functional and secure digital society.

It is encouraging to see our business units working together, both locally and cross-border, to strengthen our product- and solution-driven go-to-market approach. This is beginning to be reflected in our numbers. In the first half of 2025, our product-based segment, Run, grew revenue by 59.4% and accounted for 33.6% of total revenue. Revenue from our in-house IP grew by 25.8%, supported by increased demand for our sovereign, secure, and resilient datacenter solutions in our subsidiary Netic. Our public sector business delivered solid growth of 19.1% in the first six months and now represents 39.7% of revenue. We won 11 out of 13 tenders during the period, and our teams are focused on applying our high win rate to a significantly larger volume of opportunities in the coming years. In Q2, we announced two new public digital health engagements in Switzerland and Oman, as well as the Digital Identity Wallet contract in Denmark. The profitability in the first half of the year was negatively affected by one-off costs related to the rightsizing initiatives and large pre-sales efforts. As previously communicated, the benefits will be backloaded into the second half of the year. Combined with our overall visibility and expectations, we maintain the financial guidance for 2025.” Second quarter 2025 Trifork Group In Q2/2025, Trifork Group revenue amounted to EURm 55.1, a net increase of 5.1% from Q2/2024, the combined result of an organic growth of 2.9% and an inorganic growth of 2.2%.

Adjusted for EUR 4.6m higher hardware and third-party licenses compared to Q2/2024, revenue growth was 18.4%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.9% (Q2/2024: 19.2%). Trifork Labs In Q2/2025, fair value adjustment of Trifork Labs investments was EURm 0.7 (Q2/2024: EURm 1.2) At 30 June 2025, the book value of active Labs investments amounted to EURm 84.4 (30 June 2024: EURm 76.7).

While the CRO business also experienced revenue growth in the second quarter of 12% year-over-year, the full-year outlook for CRO revenue in 2025 has been revised to be slightly below CRO revenue level in 2024 (previous outlook 10-20% revenue growth). Outlook for EBIT-margin in the CRO business has been revised to around 20% (previously 25-31%). Our CRO business has grown very significantly over the last two years where revenue has by far outpaced our mid-term annual growth guidance of 10%. In 2025, we have experienced a decline in revenue from the US driven by macroeconomic uncertainty encompassing a difficult funding environment for some of our customers. This has translated into longer decision timelines. The development in Europe is on the contrary sound. As a result of the slowdown we experience in the US, we have adjusted our full-year 2025 outlook for CRO revenue to be slightly below the CRO revenue level in 2024 (previous outlook 10-20% revenue growth).

A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities Published: 2025-08-20 07:34:08 CEST FLSmidth & Co. A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025.

The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025.

Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.

EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities Published: 2025-08-20 07:34:08 CEST FLSmidth & Co. A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024.

Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region.

Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.

A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities Published: 2025-08-20 07:34:08 CEST FLSmidth & Co. A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025.

Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.

EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities Published: 2025-08-20 07:34:08 CEST FLSmidth & Co. A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025.

Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency.

EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities Published: 2025-08-20 07:34:08 CEST FLSmidth & Co. A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline can primarily be attributed to a lower order intake within upgrades & retrofits due to the delays to larger modernisation projects in North America. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,781m compared to DKK 5,093m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 100.2% in Q2 2025. Products order intake increased by 44% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 53% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). No large orders were announced in neither Q2 2025 nor in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased to DKK 4,869m compared to DKK 5,681m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 112.2% in Q2 2025. PC&V order intake increased by 7% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 13% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of equipment orders as well as an unchanged level for aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by higher order intake in the SAMER and EMEA regions, partly offset by a lower order intake in the NAMER region. The order backlog decreased to DKK 1,000m compared to DKK 1,078m at the end of Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 108.5% in Q2 2025. Consolidated order intake increased by 3% in Q2 2025 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was primarily a result of a higher order intake in Products and was partly offset by a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 7m in order intake in Q2 2024. The order backlog decreased by 13% to DKK 10,650m compared to Q2 2024. The book-to-bill ratio was 104.1% in Q2 2025. Financial performance Service revenue decreased by 3% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline is primarily a reflection of the timing of the execution of certain orders. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue within professional services and upgrades & retrofits. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 19.6% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 27m as well as other operating net income of DKK 34m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 411m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.9% compared to DKK 403m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.0% in Q2 2024. Products revenue decreased by 43% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 39% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily a reflection of the delayed execution of orders within certain product groups. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders will be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 16m as well as other operating net income of DKK 25m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -50m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -8.2% compared to DKK -103m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.7% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to Q2 2024 (increase of 24% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase reflects the positive momentum in the business and was driven by both higher equipment- and aftermarket-related revenue. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 23.7% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 8m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 160m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.6% compared to DKK 134m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 22.1% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 12% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 5% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 44m in revenue in Q2 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the PC&V business. The gross profit amounted to DKK 1,199m (unchanged compared to Q2 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.5% (31.3% in Q2 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 50m and other operating net income of DKK 59m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 15.2% in Q2 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 15.5% compared to 8.8% in Q2 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 99m in Q2 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 11.5% in Q2 2024. Profit from the continuing business was DKK 262m in Q2 2025 (Q2 2024: DKK 76m). Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 717m compared to a gain of DKK 112m in Q2 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Results in H1 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 7% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 4% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The decline was primarily a result of a lower order intake for upgrades & retrofits and spare parts and primarily in North America as well as in South America where orders were particularly strong in H1 2024. The year-on-year decline was partly offset by a higher order intake for consumables. Products order intake decreased by 9% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 7% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline reflects that a single large order was announced during H1 2025 (albeit with undisclosed total value), whereas two large orders with a combined value of approximately DKK 680m were announced in H1 2024. PC&V order intake increased by 12% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 16% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of both equipment- and aftermarket-related orders. In addition, the increase was primarily driven by a higher order intake in the EMEA and SAMER regions. Consolidated order intake decreased by 4% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decrease was primarily a result of a lower order intake in Service. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 37m in order intake in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by a higher order intake in the PC&V business. Financial performance Service revenue increased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 9% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The higher revenue was primarily driven by higher revenue from consumables and upgrades & retrofits, driven by effective backlog management and improved order execution, partly offset by lower revenue in professional services, which can be partly explained by the exit from basic labour services. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region.

Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024.

Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

A/S - Half Year financial report FLSmidth & Co. A/S H1 2025 Interim Financial Report: Adjusted EBITA margin increased to 15.2% in Q2 2025, driven by the continued execution of our strategic priorities COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT NO. 23-2025 FLSmidth & Co. A/S 20 August 2025 Copenhagen, Denmark Today, the Board of Directors of FLSmidth have approved the H1 2025 Interim Financial Report. Highlights in Q2 2025: Continued and disciplined execution of our strategic priorities despite macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties Further reduction in SG&A driving strong progression in underlying profitability, with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2% Solid organic order intake growth in PC&V and Products, whereas organic Service order intake is slightly down versus Q2 2024 Solid cash flow generation and launch of the company’s first share buy-back programme since 2012 Signed agreements to sell the Cement business and corporate headquarters in Copenhagen The financial guidance for the full year 2025 was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025) Continued progression on all our science-based sustainability targets FLSmidth Group CEO, Mikko Keto, comments: “ In Q2 2025, we advanced our strategy despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. Profitability strengthened with an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.2%, reflecting continued momentum. Orders grew by 3% year-on-year, driven especially by higher Products orders, while Pumps, Cyclones & Valves delivered 13% organic growth from targeted sales force investments. Service orders declined by 1% due to delayed modernisation projects in North America linked to tariff uncertainty, though these remain in the pipeline and recovery is expected in the coming quarters. We also achieved three strategic milestones: the DKK 730 million sale of our headquarters, strengthening the balance sheet; the divestment of FLSmidth Cement, advancing our transition to a pure-play mining technology and service provider; and the launch of our first share buy-back programme since 2012, reinforcing our commitment to shareholder returns. Alongside an upgraded earnings guidance, these results underline our delivery on strategy and the creation of a stronger, more resilient FLSmidth.” Updated segment reporting As a result of the signed agreements to divest FLSmidth Cement, including the Air Pollution Control business, the business has been classified as discontinued activities and assets held for sale. Consequently, FLSmidth has as of Q2 2025 changed its segment reporting to reflect that FLSmidth going forward will be a pure-play supplier of technology and services to the mining industry. As such, FLSmidth will as of Q2 2025 report on the following three continuing segments: Service, Products, and Pumps, Cyclones & Valves (PC&V). On average, the PC&V segment is expected to comprise approximately 25% equipment-related orders and 75% aftermarket-related orders. The new segments have been defined based on our go-to-market strategy and are consistent with the Group’s internal management and reporting structure going forward. Results in Q2 2025 Commercial performance Service order intake decreased by 8% compared to Q2 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments).

The Adjusted EBITA margin was 20.0% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 52m as well as other operating net income of DKK 36m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in H1 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 831m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 19.6% compared to DKK 716m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 17.7% in H1 2024. Products revenue decreased by 33% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 32% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by delayed execution of certain orders. FLSmidth expects the majority of these orders to be executed during the second half of 2025. The Adjusted EBITA margin was -9.9% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 32m as well as other operating net income of DKK 41m, which primarily related to sale of certain properties in Q2 2025. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK -131m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.3% compared to DKK -208m corresponding to an EBITA margin of -9.9% in Q2 2024. PC&V revenue increased by 17% compared to H1 2024 (increase of 21% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year increase was driven by a higher level of aftermarket-related revenue. In addition, the increase was primarily a result of higher revenue in the EMEA region. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 24.2% when excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 17m. There was no impact from other operating net income in the quarter. Including these items, EBITA increased to DKK 330m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 23.0% compared to DKK 296m corresponding to an EBITA margin of 24.2% in Q2 2024. Consolidated revenue decreased by 5% compared to H1 2024 (decrease of 1% if excluding currency effects and effects from divestments). The year-on-year decline was primarily driven by lower revenue in Products. In addition, Non-Core Activities contributed with DKK 94m in revenue in H1 2024. The decline was partly offset by higher revenue in the Service and PC&V businesses. Gross profit increased by 8% to DKK 2,503m (DKK 2,311m in H1 2024) corresponding to a gross margin of 35.3% (31.0% in H1 2024). Excluding transformation and separation costs of DKK 101m and other operating net income of DKK 77m, the Adjusted EBITA margin was 14.9% in H1 2025. Including these items, the EBITA margin was 14.5% compared to 8.6% in H1 2024. Non-Core Activities impacted EBITA negatively by DKK 161m in H1 2024. Excluding Non-Core Activities, the EBITA margin would have been 10.9% in H1 2024. Profit for the period for the continuing business amounted to DKK 570m compared to DKK 277m in H1 2024. Discontinued activities reported a total loss of DKK 674m compared to a gain of DKK 104m in H1 2024. The loss includes impairment charges of DKK 495m relating to the divestment of the Cement business and derecognition of certain deferred tax assets. Other business Divestment of Corporate Headquarters Ref. Company Announcement no. 9-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to sell its corporate headquarters for a total net cash gain of approximately DKK 730m to be paid in full to FLSmidth upon closing of the transaction, expectedly at the end of Q1 2026. The expected accounting gain amounts to approximately DKK 690 million. Divestment of FLSmidth Cement Ref. Company Announcement no. 10-2025, FLSmidth has entered into an agreement to divest its Cement business for a total initial consideration of approximately DKK 550m, plus a deferred cash consideration of up to approximately DKK 550m. The transaction is expected to close during the second half 2025. Divestment of Air Pollution Control business On 30 June 2025, FLSmidth announced that it had entered into an agreement to divest its Air Pollution Control business. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2025 and includes all related assets, including intellectual property, technology, employees and order backlog. Changes to Executive Leadership Team In June, FLSmidth announced that Mikko Tepponen, Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer, had decided step down from his position to pursue an opportunity outside of the company. As part of the implementation of the new corporate model, the role of Chief Digital Officer & Chief Operations Officer will be eliminated. Consequently, the respective responsibilities for Digital and Manufacturing will be transferred to other members of the executive team. Further, the Chief Financial Officer will take over the responsibility for IT, and manufacturing activities will be managed by the three Business Lines, enhancing their respective end-to-end P&L ownership. In addition, following the agreement to divest FLSmidth Cement, Christopher Ashworth, President of FLSmidth Cement, has left the company. During the period until closing of the transaction, Cori Petersen, Chief People Officer & Global Business Services Executive Vice President, will act as interim President of FLSmidth Cement. Financial guidance for the full year 2025 The financial guidance for 2025, which was updated on 14 August 2025 (ref. Company Announcement no. 22-2025), is maintained. As such, FLSmidth expects revenue of DKK 14.5-15.0bn (previously DKK ~15.0bn). The downward adjustment from previous guidance is partly attributable to the expectation of lower revenue from the order backlog due to customer-driven delays affecting the execution of certain Products orders. Further, the updated revenue guidance reflects adverse foreign exchange rate movements. In addition, FLSmidth expects an Adjusted EBITA margin of 15.0-15.5% (previously 14.0-14.5%). The upgraded Adjusted EBITA margin guidance incorporates the stronger-than-anticipated benefits from the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency. Guidance 20 June 2025 Guidance 14 August 2025 Revenue, DKK ~15.0bn 14.5-15.0bn Adj. EBITA margin 1 14.0-14.5% 15.0-15.5% Compared to 2024, we expect market demand for aftermarket services in the global mining industry to remain stable and active, whereas the market demand for equipment is expected to remain soft. The Adjusted EBITA margin is expected to be positively impacted by the ongoing implementation of our corporate model, driving further business simplification and operational efficiency, as well as enhanced commercial execution. The Adjusted EBITA margin guidance excludes costs related to the ongoing transformation activities and the separation of the Mining and Cement businesses. These costs are expected to amount to approximately DKK 200m for the full year 2025. In addition, the guidance for Adjusted EBITA margin now excludes Other Operating Net Income. Other Operating Net Income totalled an income of DKK 77m in H1 2025.

The better-than-expected performance was primarily driven by the initial positive effects of the change in business model for the Swedish distribution business SDR, focusing on automated packing of printed matter, and the takeover of local sales from former franchisees. The EBITDA loss in Bekey was also reduced. These positive effects formed the basis of the upgrade of our full-year EBITDA and EBIT guidance announced last week.” Financial highlights: DKKm Q2 Q2 YTD 2025 2024 2025 2024 Revenue 342.3 343.1 652.8 662.0 EBITDA 48.4 60.6 59.0 101.5 EBIT 32.4 44.1 31.0 56.2 EBIT margin (%) 9.5 12.9 4.7 8.5 Return on securities 92.7 141.2 -59.0 296.9 Cash flows from operating activities 48.8 39.6 25.8 36.5 Free cash flows 32.4 6.3 -3.0 3.0 Performance in the business areas in Q2 2025 Last Mile (FK Distribution and SDR) Revenue was DKK 300m against DKK 302m in the year-earlier period. The continued positive effect of taking over local sales from former franchise partners in SDR largely outweighed the expected drop in volumes in FK Distribution. In line with expectations, EBITDA fell by 25% to DKK 46m. The decline was primarily due to the roll-out of automated packing for Sweden, the transition of SDR and increased capacity costs in FK Distribution, including the effect of pay adjustments for deliverers in Denmark in 2024. EBIT fell to DKK 34m for an EBIT margin of 11%. Digital Services (BoligPortal, Dayli and Bekey) Revenue was up 2% to DKK 42m, driven by a 7% growth rate in BoligPortal attributable to partnerships and tenants. EBITDA was DKK 2m, against a breakeven result in Q2 2024, attributable to improvements in BoligPortal and a loss reduction in Bekey. Operating profit (EBIT) broke even, against a loss of DKK 2m for the same period last year, resulting in a profit margin of 1%. YTD performance Consolidated revenue in H1 2025 was down 2% to DKK 653m, impacted by Last Mile where the revenue increase in SDR did not offset the effect of a volume decline in FK Distribution. Digital Services delivered 3% growth. EBITDA fell by 42% to DKK 59m, primarily due to increased costs in Last Mile relating to automated packing for SDR and the business transition, while Digital Services delivered improvements. EBIT was down 45% to DKK 31m, driven by the revenue and EBITDA performance. The EBIT margin was 4.7%. Guidance for 2025 As announced in Company Announcement no. 10 of 14 August 2025, the Group’s full-year EBIT and EBITDA guidance for 2025 has been upgraded. North Media now expects consolidated revenue in the DKK 1,270-1,315m range, EBITDA in the DKK 105-130m range and EBIT in the DKK 50-75m range.

Rental income is now estimated at ISK 15,200–15,500 million and EBITDA at ISK 10,800–11,100 million for the year 2025. We are experiencing strong demand for commercial real estate.

Changes to the property portfolio have had a positive impact on year-on-year rental growth, while like-for-like rental growth amounts to 0.3%. Two major transactions were completed in the second quarter of 2025, adding two outstanding properties, Gróska and the Exeter Hotel, to the Company’s portfolio. These properties are highly consistent with the Company’s strategy as they are both located within designated core areas, with tenants including both listed companies and public entities. The additional annual rental income from these assets is estimated at ISK 1,600 million as of 2026. The occupancy rate is 97%, in line with previous levels. Approximately 43% of the Company’s rental income derives from public entities and listed companies. Tenant defaults remain low and numerous leasing projects are in the pipeline.” Operations and Performance Operating revenues amounted to ISK 7,578 million in the first six months of the year, of which rental income amounted to ISK 7,169 million. Rental income increased by 4.9% compared to the same period in 2024, corresponding to a real increase of just under 0.5%. Several changes to the property portfolio between years have had an impact on rental income. EBITDA amounted to ISK 5,088 million, representing an increase of 4.5% compared to the same period in 2024. At the publication of the 2024 annual results, the Company presented its operating plan for 2025. Earnings guidance for 2025 has now been revised following transactions completed during the year. Rental income is now estimated at ISK 15,200–15,500 million and EBITDA at ISK 10,800–11,100 million.

The portfolio now consists of 97 properties with a total area of approximately 389 thousand square metres. The occupancy rate is around 97%, based on revenues that would be generated under full occupancy. The total fair value adjustment for the first six months of the year amounted to ISK 1,414 million. Activity and Outlook In June, the Company completed two major transactions. Firstly, it acquired all the share capital in Gróska ehf. and Gróðurhúsið ehf. Gróska ehf. owns the property Gróska, comprising approximately 18,600 sqm together with a 6,200 sqm underground car park, or a total of around 24,800 sqm. Secondly, the Company acquired Tryggvagata ehf., which owns the properties at Tryggvagata 14 and 10. The total floor area of these properties is approximately 5,500 sqm, consisting of a 106-room, four-star hotel in downtown Reykjavík (Exeter Hotel) and an adjoining office building. The additional annual rental income from these two transactions is estimated at ISK 1,600 million as of 2026. In total, 36 lease agreements covering approximately 17,290 sqm were concluded in the second quarter, equal to the same period last year, which was the largest quarter in the Company’s history. Among the largest lease agreements during the period were: an agreement with Öldungur for 10,384 sqm in the property at Sóltún 2; an agreement with Samherji for 1,255 sqm for its new headquarters at Hagasmári 1; an agreement with EFLA for 1,009 sqm in the property at Glerárgata 32; and an agreement with Arctica Finance for 825 sqm at Katrínartún 2.

Recently, Starbucks opened a new café at Hafnartorg Gallery, Bryggjugata 2. This is Starbucks’ second location in Iceland and also its largest. The opening of Starbucks is in line with Heimar’s strategy to create vibrant core areas where people can live, work, and enjoy leisure Sustainability The number of the Company’s environmentally certified properties increased during the period, with six properties now certified, representing approximately 41% of the Company’s portfolio. Gróska was recently added to the portfolio of certified assets, and Dvergshöfði 2 is expected to follow in the autumn.

Investments amounted to ISK 3.5 billion during the period. Profit before income tax amounted to ISK 1,753 million. Return on equity was 11.3% on an annualized basis.

Updated Outlook The Company updates its outlook for the 2025 financial year. Operating revenues are expected to be in the range of ISK 5,500–5,670 million, based on an assumed average inflation rate of 4.1% in the second half of the year. Operating profit is projected to be in the range of ISK 4,270–4,430 million. The forecast assumes that the announced transactions relating to income-generating properties will be completed in the third quarter of 2025. CEO’s Statement – Jón Þór Gunnarsson “ Solid operations and continued growth characterize the first half of the year. We are now seeing the benefits of prior years’ investments, resulting in 24% revenue growth and a stronger position for the Company. At the same time, we maintained a 78% operating profit margin (NOI ratio), which remains very strong. During the period, Kaldalón invested ISK 3.5 billion, with most of the investments made late in the half-year. Revenues from these will therefore be recognized in the second half of the year. These investments include Suðurhraun 4–6 in Garðabær and Grjótháls 2 in Reykjavík. A new service station was also delivered at Lambhagavegur. Kaldalón has, in a short time, developed a dense network of car-wash facilities for a client, with strong demand underscoring the quality and potential of arterial-road sites owned by the Company. Building permits have also been approved for 3,400 m² of industrial premises at Fossaleyni 19–23 in Reykjavík, to house food production. Delivery is scheduled for the second half of next year. The Company has signed purchase agreements, subject to customary conditions, for Krókháls 16, Skúlagata 15, and Klettháls 1A in Reykjavík. These acquisitions are expected to increase annual revenues by ISK 203 million once completed. Total assets at mid-year amounted to just under ISK 81 billion. Interest-bearing debt was just over ISK 45 billion, with the loan-to-value ratio broadly unchanged at 57.6%. During the period, the Company issued bonds and commercial papers in the market totaling ISK 6.7 billion. Listed debt now represents 31% of interest-bearing liabilities, in line with the strategy of increasing indexed debt and market-based financing. The Company’s market funding terms indicate considerable opportunities for refinancing. Demand for rental space remains stable, and the economy shows resilience to a high interest rate environment. There are no indications of a change in this trend, although the long-term effects remain to be seen. Risk-free rates increased during the period, with a negative impact on property valuations. Kaldalón continues to benefit from strong cash flows, with a weighted average lease maturity of nearly 10 years. The Company is well positioned to serve its clients’ needs and capitalize on the many opportunities we see in the real estate market. ” Purchase Agreements for New Properties Purchase agreements, subject to conditions, have been signed for Krókháls 16, Skúlagata 15, and Klettháls 1A.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Adjusted key figures are used to improve comparability between reporting periods. The adjusted key figures are adjusted for the impacts of corporate transactions influencing comparability, as well as certain material non-operating items. More information on the calculation of the key figures is available in the tables section of the Half-Year Financial Report. Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Adjusted key figures are used to improve comparability between reporting periods. The adjusted key figures are adjusted for the impacts of corporate transactions influencing comparability, as well as certain material non-operating items. More information on the calculation of the key figures is available in the tables section of the Half-Year Financial Report. Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Adjusted key figures are used to improve comparability between reporting periods. The adjusted key figures are adjusted for the impacts of corporate transactions influencing comparability, as well as certain material non-operating items. More information on the calculation of the key figures is available in the tables section of the Half-Year Financial Report. Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer.

January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

The complete Half-Year Financial Report with tables is attached to this release and is also available on the company’s website at The figures in this release are unaudited. January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

The dividend is paid in two instalments (EUR 0.55 and EUR 0.55). *** The number of personnel stated has been converted to full-time personnel As its key financial figures, United Bankers presents adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating profit, which the company uses to illustrate the profitability and result of the Group’s business operations as a going concern. Adjusted key figures are used to improve comparability between reporting periods. The adjusted key figures are adjusted for the impacts of corporate transactions influencing comparability, as well as certain material non-operating items. More information on the calculation of the key figures is available in the tables section of the Half-Year Financial Report. Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation.

January–June 2025 in brief The Group’s revenue (income from operations) in the review period amounted to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 11.8%. The figures for the comparison period include a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II. The Group’s adjusted EBITDA amounted to EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.0 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 30.9% and adjusted operating profit amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 36.3%. The Group’s operating profit for the review period amounted to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 34.8% and the profit for the review period amounted to EUR 7.0 million (EUR 10.5 million in 1–6/2024), a decrease of 33.6%. The Group’s earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96 in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from wealth management in the review period amounted to EUR 24.3 million (EUR 28.3 million in 1–6/2024). Net fee income from capital markets services amounted to EUR 0.6 million (EUR 0.6 million in 1–6/2024). Assets under management rose to a new record high of EUR 4.9 billion during the review period (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The cost-to-income ratio amounted to 0.69 (0.59). The company reiterates its guidance for 2025: The company estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period. Review period in brief United Bankers' result for the first half of the year was clearly lower than in the comparison period. The weakening of the result is mainly explained by the funds' performance fees, which fell short of the record-high level of the previous year. In the comparison period, the funds' fees included a performance fee of EUR 10.6 million recorded from the sale of the forest fund UB Nordic Forest Fund II LP, which was generated when the fund's partnership interests and forest properties were sold to MEAG, the asset management company of the German Munich Re Group. In other respects, the wealth management segment's fee income developed positively in terms of fund management fees, income from asset management and income from structured products. The positive development of the funds' performance fees also continued, when the performance fees recorded from the sale of the UB Nordic Forest Fund II are eliminated from the comparison figures. United Bankers' assets under management increased from EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 4.9 billion during the review period. The uncertainty prevailing in the investment markets weighed on the demand for asset management products and services throughout the first half of the year. In addition, the transfer of the management of the Asilo Argo fund away from UB Fund Management Company decreased assets under management by approximately EUR 104 million compared to the situation at the turn of the year. The net subscriptions of the funds remained at a clearly lower level than in previous years, at EUR 31.8 million, including the investment commitments of funds in the form of a limited liability company. Of the funds, real estate funds in particular continued to be affected by redemption pressure, even though there have already been the first signs of a turn for the better in the real estate market. In the difficult market situation that has lasted for a long time, United Bankers has succeeded – unlike many other market players – in keeping its real estate funds open continuously. United Bankers has also sought to take advantage of the favourable situation in the real estate market to the benefit of its clients. Founded in 2024 and aimed at professional investors, housing fund UB Asuntorahasto I Ky launched its investment activities during the first half of the year. During the first half of the year, the fund raised approximately EUR 26 million in capital and also acquired its first investment targets. The sales of discretionary asset management services remained at a good level during the review period, reaching approximately EUR 105 million. The volatility experienced in the market provided good opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products. Their sales almost doubled to EUR 44.5 million.

Adjusted key figures are used to improve comparability between reporting periods. The adjusted key figures are adjusted for the impacts of corporate transactions influencing comparability, as well as certain material non-operating items. More information on the calculation of the key figures is available in the tables section of the Half-Year Financial Report. Group revenue and profit performance January-June 2025 (comparison figures 1 January – 30 June 2024) In terms of revenue, the first half of the year was the second strongest six-month period in United Bankers' history. However, revenue and profit fell short of the record-breaking comparison period. United Bankers’ revenue (income from operations) declined during the review period by 11.8 per cent to EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million). The Group’s adjusted operating profit decreased to EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.8 million) and the adjusted operating profit margin decreased to 30.2 per cent (41.9 per cent). Earnings per share decreased to EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). Return on equity amounted to 25.3 per cent (35.9 per cent) and the cost-to-income ratio to 0.69 (0.59). The weakening of revenue and profit during the review period was primarily due to the funds' clearly lower performance fees than in the comparison period. Overall, United Bankers' wealth management business developed positively during the first half of the year. With the exception of the above-mentioned performance fees, the wealth management segment's fee income was growing across the board. Fund management fees increased slightly, and the performance fees of existing funds also developed positively. The continued growth in the capital under discretionary asset management services, in turn, supported a clear increase in fee income from asset management. The uncertainty and volatility prevailing in the markets, on their part, provided opportunities for the issuance of structured investment products, with sales almost doubling. As a result, fee income from structured investment products increased significantly. The Group's largest segment recorded revenue of EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) during the review period, while EBITDA settled at EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The Group's capital markets services business also developed favourably in the first half of the year, although the situation in the M&A and IPO markets continued to be clearly quieter than usual. The slight increase in the level of activity was reflected in the positive development of UB Corporate Finance's fee and commission income compared to the comparison period. During the first half of the year, the company acted as a financial advisor in various financing and cooperation arrangements. Revenue from capital markets services were EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million). EBITDA increased by more than 50 per cent to EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). The return on the Group's own investments, reported under the Other segment, had a positive impact on the result for the review period. In recent years, United Bankers has invested significantly in promoting growth. These measures have included, among other things, the renewal of IT systems and digital services, which support the efficiency of operations and the development of the customer experience. The company has also determinedly developed its products and services and strengthened their sales power both in Finland and in the international market. The costs of these investments will partly be visible in advance before the realisation of future growth. The Group's expenses increased moderately in the first half of the year compared to the comparison period. Administrative expenses, including personnel and other administrative expenses, increased by 3.8 per cent to EUR 15.1 million (EUR 14.5 million). Personnel expenses increased by 2.3 per cent to EUR 10.9 million (EUR 10.6 million). Other administrative expenses, on the other hand, increased by 8.1 per cent to EUR 4.2 million (EUR 3.9 million). Cost pressure was exerted on, among other things, IT and system costs, a significant part of which, however, were project costs related to the implementation of the new information system. Investments in promoting international sales were reflected in the increase in travel costs, among others. The increase in personnel-related expenses was also partly recorded in other administrative expenses, for example through costs related to training. In recent years, United Bankers has also made significant investments in the development of sustainability work and its communications. During the first half of the year, the Group continued to prepare for the reporting requirements of the Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) before the European Commission proposed easing the reporting regulations. The Stop the Clock directive will at least postpone the entry into force of sustainability reporting, but the intention is also to simplify the reporting requirements. This may ease the cost pressure related to sustainability reporting in the future. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment increased to EUR 1.6 million (EUR 1.2 million) for the first half of the year, mainly as a result of the implementation of a comprehensive IT system reform in early summer 2024. The renovation of the premises of United Bankers' Helsinki headquarters a couple of years ago is also still reflected in the amount of depreciation. The number of full-time employees increased slightly compared to the situation at the turn of the year and was 166 at the end of June (161 people on 31 December 2024). Of these, a total of 12 (9 people) were fixed-term employees. The increase in the number of fixed-term employees is partly explained by the Group's normal seasonal increase in the number of temporary employees during the summer. CEO’s review John Ojanperä In early 2025, our operating environment was twofold. Thanks to the decline in inflation and interest rates, market sentiment was positive at the beginning of the first half of the year. However, as the review period progressed, unclear tariff decisions by US President Donald Trump, the escalation of the Middle East conflict and increased geopolitical tensions increased market volatility. Traditionally, uncertainty in the market leads investors to be cautious, which in turn makes fundraising more difficult. This was also the case in the first half of 2025. The equity markets developed positively in the first half of the year: measured by total return indices, the increase was 12.3% in Finland, 10.4% in Europe and 6.0% in the United States. However, the significant weakening of the US dollar weighed on euro-denominated returns, and the S&P 500 index fell by 6.5% in euro terms. This also led to a 2.9% decline in the global equity index in euro terms. The Finnish real estate market continued to be characterised by low transaction volumes and subdued price developments. In the forest market, on the other hand, the development continued to be positive, thanks to record-high wood stumpage prices. In terms of revenue, the first half of 2025 was the company's second strongest half-year period ever. In the light of the key figures in the income statement, the first half of the year was a very strong six-month period, and its main driver was the favourable development of the forest market. In comparison with the previous year's figures, it should be remembered that in early 2024, the UB Nordic Forest Fund II was sold and a significant performance fee of EUR 10.6 million was recorded in the result for the first half of 2024. The company's revenue for the first half of the year were EUR 29.1 million (EUR 33.0 million 1–6/2024). Adjusted operating profit was EUR 8.8 million (EUR 13.5 million) and earnings per share were EUR 0.63 (EUR 0.96). The cost-to-income ratio was 0.69 (0.59). The wealth management segment's revenue was EUR 27.8 million (EUR 32.2 million) and EBITDA was EUR 10.4 million (EUR 15.3 million). The capital markets services segment's revenue was EUR 0.7 million (EUR 0.6 million) and EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (EUR 0.1 million). Despite the challenging environment, assets under management rose again to record levels. At the end of the review period, the company's assets under management totalled EUR 4.9 billion (EUR 4.8 billion on 31 December 2024). The absolute growth did not reach the level we had targeted, but considering the transfer of management of the Asilo Argo fund and the headwinds faced by alternative investments, especially real estate funds, the achieved result can be considered satisfactory given the circumstances. Net subscriptions to funds in the first half of the year totalled EUR 31.8 million (EUR 93.1 million). The company's gross sales of asset management products and services amounted to EUR 292 million (EUR 273 million). The challenges in the real estate fund market led to a decline in net subscriptions of funds. However, the increased gross sales indicate that the company's investments in growth are starting to pay off, and sales power has strengthened. The implementation of the strategy progressed well during the first half of the year. During the spring, we continued to develop our already high-quality products and services with our clients' needs and satisfaction in mind. In recent years, we have continued to invest significantly in discretionary asset management services. Systems and processes are constantly being rationalised and made more efficient. During the review period, we also managed to make several key recruitments. The company's management team was strengthened when Perttu Purhonen was appointed as a member of the management team in April. Perttu has a strong background in asset management positions at executive level, among other things. In terms of portfolio management, one of our key successes is that we have been able to keep our real estate funds open despite the challenging situation in the real estate fund market. In addition, we successfully launched a new housing fund, UB Asuntorahasto I Ky. I believe that the timing is now exceptionally favourable for real estate investments: yield requirements have risen, interest rates and inflation are falling, transaction volumes are recovering, and the low level of construction is increasing demand for existing properties. Investments in sustainability have also continued. In the 2024 UN PRI assessment, published in spring 2025, we received the highest possible score (5/5) in all scored asset classes and the second best grade (4/5) in the sections related to responsible investment procedures, governance and strategy, and assurance procedures. In addition, we were the first Finnish asset manager to sign the Operating Principles for Impact Management (OPIM), which strengthens our commitment to measurable impact in investment activities, especially in the field of forest investments. I look to the future with optimism. The market has been challenging in recent years, but I believe that at some point we can expect a tailwind from it. I am confident that the investments we have made in growth will be realised over time. Thank you to our clients, the UB team and our other stakeholders. This is a good place to continue! Financial guidance for 2025 The company reiterates its guidance for 2025, and estimates its adjusted operating profit to be significantly below the level of 2024, as performance fees are expected to be lower than in the exceptionally strong comparison period.

CEO KARI TUOMALA: IMPROVING PROFITABILITY SUPPORTS STRONG GROWTH In the first half of 2025, our revenue grew strongly to EUR 24.9 (6.7) million. This growth was driven in particular by successful deliveries of modular energy storage solutions in Finland and the delivery of power quality solutions and products to international customers. The development was driven by active demand in both the energy storage business supporting renewable energy and the power quality market, which promotes energy efficiency. During the review period, we succeeded in improving the profitability of the company's operations. We improved the productization of our deliveries, which resulted in greater efficiency in the operations of our own factory. In addition, we were able to leverage the experience and expertise gained from previous deliveries. Our operating margin (EBITDA) for the first half of the year was approximately EUR 0.3 million positive, whereas in the comparison period it was approximately EUR 3.4 million negative. Net sales for the comparison period were exceptionally low, which means that the periods are not entirely comparable. A significant part of the 2024 net sales and margin were recognized in the second half of the year, so to get a more accurate picture, it is worth using the whole previous year as a comparison, when net sales were EUR 35.8 million and EBITDA was EUR -0.8 million (-2.2% of net sales). Our strong growth continues to maintain pressure to control cost increases and realize economies of scale in production and deliveries. The efforts to improve profitability will continue. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged: the company's revenue will grow strongly compared to 2024, and EBITDA will be EUR 1–3 million. Solid order intake The green transition, electrification and growth in automation are strong trends that support sales both in Finland and internationally. Growth has been particularly strong in Finnish energy storage projects, and the need for investment is also reflected in the energy efficiency targets of the metal industry. Our order intake was at a strong level at the end of June: EUR 29.3 (46.8) million. The value of new orders in the first half of the year was EUR 26.2 (39.7) million. Our energy storage strategy is yielding results. During the reporting period, we delivered Finland's largest energy storage facility at the time, with a capacity of 38 MW/43 MWh, to Lappeenrannan Energia and eNordic. Our partnership was further strengthened by a follow-up order for another 30 MW/30 MWh energy storage system to be delivered to eNordic and Ardian. During the review period, we also completed several long-term delivery agreements, which were transferred to our lifecycle services, and our cooperation with our customers continues with the support of our service business. In the power quality business, a large active filter order for Egypt still accounts for a significant portion of our order intake. In addition, orders for compensators for the steel industry balance our order intake and its product range. Organization and product development support growth and profitability Our growth has been determined and based on our strong expertise in energy storage and power quality. We are also involved in the market by developing our own energy storage projects, where we can leverage both our technological expertise and our comprehensive understanding of the market. As a result, we can offer our customers the best returns and minimize Merus Power's risks through cost-effective and optimized implementation. We have built both our organization and our technology with a long-term focus on modular and scalable solutions. During the reporting period, we have seen clear evidence of the scalability of both our modular solutions and our expertise. Our number of employees grew by 24 to 151 in the first half of the year. The systematic growth of our personnel strengthens our ability to implement our growth strategy and ensure that we can deliver on our customer promises in the future. Investing in our own energy storage system With our own energy storage facility, Merus Power is able to meet product development needs and test the properties of energy storage in a real market environment. This has been a significant investment in the development of technology and services and demonstrates our commitment to market leadership. The development environment enables the continuous optimization of trading services and system operations. At the end of the review period in June, the company carried out a directed share issue to strengthen its equity capital and secure financing and other prerequisites for growth. The successful share issue raised approximately EUR 2.0 million, which will support the company's strategy in the short and medium term by improving profitability.

CEO KARI TUOMALA: IMPROVING PROFITABILITY SUPPORTS STRONG GROWTH In the first half of 2025, our revenue grew strongly to EUR 24.9 (6.7) million. This growth was driven in particular by successful deliveries of modular energy storage solutions in Finland and the delivery of power quality solutions and products to international customers. The development was driven by active demand in both the energy storage business supporting renewable energy and the power quality market, which promotes energy efficiency. During the review period, we succeeded in improving the profitability of the company's operations. We improved the productization of our deliveries, which resulted in greater efficiency in the operations of our own factory. In addition, we were able to leverage the experience and expertise gained from previous deliveries. Our operating margin (EBITDA) for the first half of the year was approximately EUR 0.3 million positive, whereas in the comparison period it was approximately EUR 3.4 million negative. Net sales for the comparison period were exceptionally low, which means that the periods are not entirely comparable. A significant part of the 2024 net sales and margin were recognized in the second half of the year, so to get a more accurate picture, it is worth using the whole previous year as a comparison, when net sales were EUR 35.8 million and EBITDA was EUR -0.8 million (-2.2% of net sales). Our strong growth continues to maintain pressure to control cost increases and realize economies of scale in production and deliveries. The efforts to improve profitability will continue. Our forecast for the full year remains unchanged: the company's revenue will grow strongly compared to 2024, and EBITDA will be EUR 1–3 million. Solid order intake The green transition, electrification and growth in automation are strong trends that support sales both in Finland and internationally. Growth has been particularly strong in Finnish energy storage projects, and the need for investment is also reflected in the energy efficiency targets of the metal industry. Our order intake was at a strong level at the end of June: EUR 29.3 (46.8) million. The value of new orders in the first half of the year was EUR 26.2 (39.7) million. Our energy storage strategy is yielding results. During the reporting period, we delivered Finland's largest energy storage facility at the time, with a capacity of 38 MW/43 MWh, to Lappeenrannan Energia and eNordic. Our partnership was further strengthened by a follow-up order for another 30 MW/30 MWh energy storage system to be delivered to eNordic and Ardian. During the review period, we also completed several long-term delivery agreements, which were transferred to our lifecycle services, and our cooperation with our customers continues with the support of our service business. In the power quality business, a large active filter order for Egypt still accounts for a significant portion of our order intake. In addition, orders for compensators for the steel industry balance our order intake and its product range. Organization and product development support growth and profitability Our growth has been determined and based on our strong expertise in energy storage and power quality. We are also involved in the market by developing our own energy storage projects, where we can leverage both our technological expertise and our comprehensive understanding of the market. As a result, we can offer our customers the best returns and minimize Merus Power's risks through cost-effective and optimized implementation. We have built both our organization and our technology with a long-term focus on modular and scalable solutions. During the reporting period, we have seen clear evidence of the scalability of both our modular solutions and our expertise. Our number of employees grew by 24 to 151 in the first half of the year. The systematic growth of our personnel strengthens our ability to implement our growth strategy and ensure that we can deliver on our customer promises in the future. Investing in our own energy storage system With our own energy storage facility, Merus Power is able to meet product development needs and test the properties of energy storage in a real market environment. This has been a significant investment in the development of technology and services and demonstrates our commitment to market leadership. The development environment enables the continuous optimization of trading services and system operations. At the end of the review period in June, the company carried out a directed share issue to strengthen its equity capital and secure financing and other prerequisites for growth. The successful share issue raised approximately EUR 2.0 million, which will support the company's strategy in the short and medium term by improving profitability.

The strong growth led to 12% growth in divisional profit, equaling a divisional profit margin of 36% driven by operating leverage The Enterprise division was – as expected – challenged by market uncertainty due to the global trade environment. The organic revenue growth was -7% due to the market uncertainty and a difficult comparison base, while being supported by strong progress in FalCom. The divisional profit margin ended at 34% as a result of pricing discipline and cost focus, offsetting the direct tariff costs The Gaming division was – as expected – challenged by the tariff environment and weak consumer sentiment. Despite these challenges, Gaming performed well leading to 0% organic revenue growth on top of a very challenging comparison base. The divisional profit margin (excluding wind-down effects) ended at 12% as a result of pricing discipline and one-company supply chain benefits Group reported EBITA increased 46% to DKK 546 million (EBITA margin of 13%), reflecting gross margin improvements, strong cost focus due to the group-wide cost program and no extraordinary costs Free cash flow excl. M&A ended at DKK 353 million reflecting the earnings profile and positive impact on working capital. Net interest-bearing debt ended at DKK 9,850 million, equaling a reported leverage of 4.0x (reported leverage of 4.9x in Q2 2024) Following a successful execution in the first half of the year, and GN’s company-wide agility, the financial guidance for 2025 is confirmed. The organic revenue growth guidance of -3% to +3% (excluding wind-down effects) is narrowed to -2% to +2%. The guidance on EBITA-margin and free cash flow excl.

M&A (DKK million) Updated Prior Confirmed Confirmed -2% to +2% -3% to +3% 11% to 13% ~800 Key revenue assumptions for financial guidance 2025 Hearing division GN is exposed to an attractive hearing aid market, which has historically been growing 4-6% in volumes driven by ongoing favorable demographic trends. With an assumed -1% yearly ASP impact, the structural market value growth assumptions of 3-5%. As a consequence of the slower beginning of the year driven by the uncertain macroeconomic environment, it is currently expected that the market in 2025 will grow slower than its structural trend. Based on the strong sales momentum of ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi, GN in 2025 expects to continue to gain market share. In the beginning of 2025, we assumed the Hearing division to contribute with organic revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Due to the lower market growth assumption, it is currently assumed that the Hearing division will grow at the lower half of that range. Enterprise division The uncertainty and change in the trade environment are impacting our Enterprise division. We have taken significant actions to further diversify our manufacturing footprint to mitigate this, and we have also implemented targeted price adjustments in the US. With these initiatives in place, we are progressing well towards the existing assumptions for the year. In April 2025, we assumed the Enterprise division would contribute with organic revenue growth of -8% to 0%, and we are continuing to assume a contribution in the middle of this range. Gaming division Similar to the Enterprise market, the Gaming market is also impacted by the change in trade environment and general weak consumer sentiment. We have taken several mitigation actions including diversification of our manufacturing footprint and targeted price increases. These initiatives work well. In April 2025, we assumed the Gaming division to contribute with organic revenue growth of -6% to +2% (excluding the impact from the wind-down). Driven by the strong execution in the first half of the year, the Gaming division is now assuming to contribute with organic revenue growth in the upper half of that range. Key EBITA margin assumptions for the financial guidance of 2025 In light of the evolving changes in the global trade environment, GN launched significant mitigating actions in May 2025 to protect Group profitability. These significant actions included but were not limited to 1) Acceleration of diversification of manufacturing footprint; 2) U.S. price increases for Enterprise and Gaming; 3) Group-wide cost and cash initiatives. In the quarter, the changing trade environment has been managed well. The efforts to diversify the supply chain are continuing in line with original plans. Thanks to this diversification, the group-wide cost control efforts and the commercial actions that were taken across Enterprise and Gaming, the overall impact is being mitigated well. We are continuously assessing the developments and additional prudent and diligent actions will be taken as needed going forward. It is currently expected that the net impact from tariffs will impact group EBITA margin by around -1% in 2025 (as earlier communicated), of which around 0.5% has a more temporary effect. Quotes from Executive Management Peter Karlstromer, CEO of GN Store Nord, comments: “ While the macro-economic environment continues to pose challenges to GN and to our customers, we are very pleased with our execution and the progress we are making. In Hearing, our Vivia launch is going very well, leading to market share gains around the world. In Enterprise and Gaming, we have continued the diversification of our supply chain and also taken constructive commercial actions to manage the changing trade environment. We have done this well with limited negative impact while continuing to serve our customers with no disruption. All in all, we are gradually taking ourselves through a challenging period and remain very excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us across our markets and our group. Thanks to all customers, partners and employees for making this possible.” Financial overview Q2 2025 GN Store Nord Hearing division Enterprise division Gaming division Gaming Consumer DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Revenue 4,160 4,499 -8% 1,858 1,792 4% 1,713 1,873 -9% 589 611 -4% 0 223 -100% Organic growth 0%* 5% 8% 10% -7% -1% 0% 12% -100% 3% Gross profit 2,313 2,334 -1% 1,152 1,131 2% 961 1,015 -5% 191 186 3% 9 2 350% Gross profit margin 55.6% 51.9% 3.7%p 62.0% 63.1% -1.1%p 56.1% 54.2% 1.9%p 32.4% 30.4% 2.0%p NA 0.9% NA Divisional profit 1,323 1,239 7% 668 598 12% 583 651 -10% 70 2 Divisional profit margin 31.8% 27.5% 4.3%p 36.0% 33.4% 2.6%p 34.0% 34.8% -0.8%p 11.9% NA EBITA 546 374 46% EBITA margin 13.1% 8.3% 4.8%p Free cash flow excl.

The strong growth led to 12% growth in divisional profit, equaling a divisional profit margin of 36% driven by operating leverage The Enterprise division was – as expected – challenged by market uncertainty due to the global trade environment. The organic revenue growth was -7% due to the market uncertainty and a difficult comparison base, while being supported by strong progress in FalCom. The divisional profit margin ended at 34% as a result of pricing discipline and cost focus, offsetting the direct tariff costs The Gaming division was – as expected – challenged by the tariff environment and weak consumer sentiment. Despite these challenges, Gaming performed well leading to 0% organic revenue growth on top of a very challenging comparison base. The divisional profit margin (excluding wind-down effects) ended at 12% as a result of pricing discipline and one-company supply chain benefits Group reported EBITA increased 46% to DKK 546 million (EBITA margin of 13%), reflecting gross margin improvements, strong cost focus due to the group-wide cost program and no extraordinary costs Free cash flow excl. M&A ended at DKK 353 million reflecting the earnings profile and positive impact on working capital. Net interest-bearing debt ended at DKK 9,850 million, equaling a reported leverage of 4.0x (reported leverage of 4.9x in Q2 2024) Following a successful execution in the first half of the year, and GN’s company-wide agility, the financial guidance for 2025 is confirmed. The organic revenue growth guidance of -3% to +3% (excluding wind-down effects) is narrowed to -2% to +2%. The guidance on EBITA-margin and free cash flow excl.

M&A (DKK million) Updated Prior Confirmed Confirmed -2% to +2% -3% to +3% 11% to 13% ~800 Key revenue assumptions for financial guidance 2025 Hearing division GN is exposed to an attractive hearing aid market, which has historically been growing 4-6% in volumes driven by ongoing favorable demographic trends. With an assumed -1% yearly ASP impact, the structural market value growth assumptions of 3-5%. As a consequence of the slower beginning of the year driven by the uncertain macroeconomic environment, it is currently expected that the market in 2025 will grow slower than its structural trend. Based on the strong sales momentum of ReSound Vivia and ReSound Savi, GN in 2025 expects to continue to gain market share. In the beginning of 2025, we assumed the Hearing division to contribute with organic revenue growth of 5% to 9%. Due to the lower market growth assumption, it is currently assumed that the Hearing division will grow at the lower half of that range. Enterprise division The uncertainty and change in the trade environment are impacting our Enterprise division. We have taken significant actions to further diversify our manufacturing footprint to mitigate this, and we have also implemented targeted price adjustments in the US. With these initiatives in place, we are progressing well towards the existing assumptions for the year. In April 2025, we assumed the Enterprise division would contribute with organic revenue growth of -8% to 0%, and we are continuing to assume a contribution in the middle of this range. Gaming division Similar to the Enterprise market, the Gaming market is also impacted by the change in trade environment and general weak consumer sentiment. We have taken several mitigation actions including diversification of our manufacturing footprint and targeted price increases. These initiatives work well. In April 2025, we assumed the Gaming division to contribute with organic revenue growth of -6% to +2% (excluding the impact from the wind-down). Driven by the strong execution in the first half of the year, the Gaming division is now assuming to contribute with organic revenue growth in the upper half of that range. Key EBITA margin assumptions for the financial guidance of 2025 In light of the evolving changes in the global trade environment, GN launched significant mitigating actions in May 2025 to protect Group profitability. These significant actions included but were not limited to 1) Acceleration of diversification of manufacturing footprint; 2) U.S. price increases for Enterprise and Gaming; 3) Group-wide cost and cash initiatives. In the quarter, the changing trade environment has been managed well. The efforts to diversify the supply chain are continuing in line with original plans. Thanks to this diversification, the group-wide cost control efforts and the commercial actions that were taken across Enterprise and Gaming, the overall impact is being mitigated well. We are continuously assessing the developments and additional prudent and diligent actions will be taken as needed going forward. It is currently expected that the net impact from tariffs will impact group EBITA margin by around -1% in 2025 (as earlier communicated), of which around 0.5% has a more temporary effect. Quotes from Executive Management Peter Karlstromer, CEO of GN Store Nord, comments: “ While the macro-economic environment continues to pose challenges to GN and to our customers, we are very pleased with our execution and the progress we are making. In Hearing, our Vivia launch is going very well, leading to market share gains around the world. In Enterprise and Gaming, we have continued the diversification of our supply chain and also taken constructive commercial actions to manage the changing trade environment. We have done this well with limited negative impact while continuing to serve our customers with no disruption. All in all, we are gradually taking ourselves through a challenging period and remain very excited about the opportunities we have ahead of us across our markets and our group. Thanks to all customers, partners and employees for making this possible.” Financial overview Q2 2025 GN Store Nord Hearing division Enterprise division Gaming division Gaming Consumer DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Growth Revenue 4,160 4,499 -8% 1,858 1,792 4% 1,713 1,873 -9% 589 611 -4% 0 223 -100% Organic growth 0%* 5% 8% 10% -7% -1% 0% 12% -100% 3% Gross profit 2,313 2,334 -1% 1,152 1,131 2% 961 1,015 -5% 191 186 3% 9 2 350% Gross profit margin 55.6% 51.9% 3.7%p 62.0% 63.1% -1.1%p 56.1% 54.2% 1.9%p 32.4% 30.4% 2.0%p NA 0.9% NA Divisional profit 1,323 1,239 7% 668 598 12% 583 651 -10% 70 2 Divisional profit margin 31.8% 27.5% 4.3%p 36.0% 33.4% 2.6%p 34.0% 34.8% -0.8%p 11.9% NA EBITA 546 374 46% EBITA margin 13.1% 8.3% 4.8%p Free cash flow excl.

Group revenue and EBIT in the first half of 2025 were record-high and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 2.3 billion, respectively. This can be compared to the same period last year with DKK 121 million in revenue and DKK -21 million in EBIT. A very significant improvement with the recognition of the upfront payment in the AbbVie-deal as the main explanation. Henrik Blou, CEO of Gubra said: “The first half year has been transformational, in a very positive way. We struck the biggest out-licensing deal so far for Gubra for our Amylin anti-obesity asset GUBamy. The partnership with AbbVie really underscores Gubra’s expertise in the metabolic space and our ability to develop novel peptide-based therapeutics. Following the deal, we decided to distribute DKK 1 billion to shareholders as an extraordinary dividend. A real strength for biotech company to be able to distribute a very meaningful amount back to shareholders while still maintaining sufficient capital to realize our strategy in the coming years. GUBAMY – PROGRESSING AS PLANNED In the second quarter, we published strong interim clinical results from the first part of the Phase 1 Multiple-Ascending-Dose study (MAD). The results exceeded our expectations. The study showed that GUBamy was well tolerated with adverse events being predominantly GI related, mild and consistent with data from the previous Single-Ascending-Dose study (SAD). On weight reduction, GUBamy delivered a remarkable weight loss. Once-weekly administration for six weeks of 1 mg or 2 mg GUBamy led to a dose dependent mean weight loss compared to a weight gain in the placebo group. LS Mean weight loss in the 2 mg cohort was -7.8% compared to an LS Mean weight gain of +2.0% in the placebo arm on day 43. The MAD study for testing higher doses during a longer treatment period is ongoing and is progressing as planned. As part of having AbbVie as partner, we are delighted to see them expanding development options in the study. Their experience and scale make a real difference. ADVANCING OUR UCN2 OBESITY PROGRAM We are equally enthusiastic about our next-in-line internal obesity program, UCN2, which is designed to promote a high-quality weight loss. Preclinical studies in animal models have demonstrated that UCN2 analogues, when administered alone, selectively reduce fat mass and simultaneously promote gains in lean body mass. When combined with other anti-obesity agents, UCN2 has shown the unique ability to completely prevent the loss of lean mass typically seen in diet-induced obese rats treated with agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Notably, UCN2 has also been shown to fully reverse the lean mass loss caused by prior semaglutide treatment. This positions UCN2 as a potentially valuable component in combination regimens, acting both as a protective and restorative agent. Beyond its metabolic effects, treatment with long-acting UCN2 analogues has resulted in improvements in cardiac and kidney function in preclinical models of chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease. UCN2 is now being prepared for Phase 1 clinical study to start early 2026. GROUP REVENUE AND EARNINGS UP VERY SIGNIFICANTLY Group revenue and EBIT in the first half of 2025 were record-high and amounted to DKK 2.5 billion and DKK 2.3 billion, respectively. This can be compared to the same period last year with DKK 121 million in revenue and DKK -21 million in EBIT. A very significant improvement with the recognition of the upfront payment in the AbbVie-deal as the main explanation. CRO BUSINESS – REVENUE SLIGHTLY BEHIND LAST YEAR Our CRO business has grown very significantly over the last two years and revenue has by far outpaced our mid-term annual growth guidance of 10%. In Q2 2025, we reported revenue of DKK 55 million which is 12% up compared to Q2 2024. However, H1 2025 revenue is 2% behind H1 2024, i.e. somewhat below our expectations. The explanation being the US market where we generally see longer decision timelines among our customers. The development in Europe is on the contrary very healthy with high growth in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. As a result of the slowdown we experience in the US, we have adjusted our full-year 2025 outlook for CRO revenue to be slightly below the revenue level in 2024 (previously 10-20% growth). EBIT- margin expectation for full-year 2025 for the CRO business has been reduced to around 20% (previously 25-31%). HANDING OVER THE BATON TO INCOMING CEO After almost 10 years in Gubra it is time for me now to hand over the baton to a new incoming CEO. I am really excited and proud of what we have achieved that has propelled Gubra into a completely different league. I have always admired leaders who found an appropriate point in time to step back, and I feel that now is the right time. I genuinely wish to thank the founders, the Board and our shareholders for all the trust and also all the fantastic colleagues that have brought Gubra to where we are today. It feels incredibly rewarding to leave the company in such a strong position, with significant potential still ahead, as Markus Rohrwild takes over as CEO starting September 8, 2025.” Key financial highlights for Q2 2025 Key ratio CRO segment D&P segment Group DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Q2 2025 Q2 2024 Revenue 54.9 49.0 2,379.7 6.6 2,434.6 55.6 Organic revenue growth 12% 18% 35956% -38% 4279% 7% Reported Cost of Sales & Opex -41.3 -38.9 -124.3 -36.2 -165.9 -75.3 Adj.

CEO Aarne Aktan: Slight Improvement in Result – Stronger Outlook for the Rest of the Year The positive profitability trend continued in the second quarter. The comparable operating result was EUR 0.1 million, which improved by EUR 0.1 million relative to the comparison period. This was the sixth consecutive quarter in which a comparable operating result improved year-on-year. However, profitability development was two-fold: The Retail & Commerce segment showed a good improvement in profitability, whereas the Utilities segment’s profitability development fell short of expectations, mainly due to losses in the consulting business. The Group’s comparable revenue was EUR 12.1 million, which diminished by EUR 0.7 million relative to the comparison period. The Retail & Commerce segment’s performance aligned with the company’s expectations. The segment’s comparable revenue was EUR 9.1 million, decreasing by EUR 0.4 million year-on-year. The revenue was affected by a market with continued cautiousness in customer demand and delays in investment decisions. In contrast, the segment’s profitability was good: The comparable operating result was EUR 0.7 million, increasing by EUR 0.4 million year-on-year. During the review period, the company’s Board of Directors appointed Petteri Ahonen as Executive Vice President of the segment and a member of the Group Executive Team. Ahonen assumed his duties in August. During the review period, the Utilities segment’s performance was particularly hampered by reduced customer invoicing rates within the consulting business. In contrast, the software business developed as expected. The segment’s comparable operating result was EUR -0.6 million, a decrease of EUR 0.3 million relative to the comparison period. The revenue was EUR 3.0 million, decreasing by EUR 0.3 million year-on-year. During the review period, Jesper Kaysen assumed the role of Executive Vice President of Utilities and became a member of the Group Executive Team. We commence the autumn season with clarity in objectives and next steps. We expect our financial performance to strengthen in the second half of the financial year. Despite the challenging operating environment and the state of the global economy, the outlook for the Retail & Commerce segment remains moderate. The market outlook for the Utilities segment is stable, and the Nordic market offers growth opportunities for both the software and consulting businesses. Profit Guidance 2025 Comparable revenue will decrease slightly, while the comparable operating result will improve significantly. Excluding the divested healthcare software solutions business, comparable revenue was EUR 48,818 thousand in the financial year 2024. Comparable operating result for the financial year 2024 was EUR 710 thousand.

CEO Aarne Aktan: Slight Improvement in Result – Stronger Outlook for the Rest of the Year The positive profitability trend continued in the second quarter. The comparable operating result was EUR 0.1 million, which improved by EUR 0.1 million relative to the comparison period. This was the sixth consecutive quarter in which a comparable operating result improved year-on-year. However, profitability development was two-fold: The Retail & Commerce segment showed a good improvement in profitability, whereas the Utilities segment’s profitability development fell short of expectations, mainly due to losses in the consulting business. The Group’s comparable revenue was EUR 12.1 million, which diminished by EUR 0.7 million relative to the comparison period. The Retail & Commerce segment’s performance aligned with the company’s expectations. The segment’s comparable revenue was EUR 9.1 million, decreasing by EUR 0.4 million year-on-year. The revenue was affected by a market with continued cautiousness in customer demand and delays in investment decisions. In contrast, the segment’s profitability was good: The comparable operating result was EUR 0.7 million, increasing by EUR 0.4 million year-on-year. During the review period, the company’s Board of Directors appointed Petteri Ahonen as Executive Vice President of the segment and a member of the Group Executive Team. Ahonen assumed his duties in August. During the review period, the Utilities segment’s performance was particularly hampered by reduced customer invoicing rates within the consulting business. In contrast, the software business developed as expected. The segment’s comparable operating result was EUR -0.6 million, a decrease of EUR 0.3 million relative to the comparison period. The revenue was EUR 3.0 million, decreasing by EUR 0.3 million year-on-year. During the review period, Jesper Kaysen assumed the role of Executive Vice President of Utilities and became a member of the Group Executive Team. We commence the autumn season with clarity in objectives and next steps. We expect our financial performance to strengthen in the second half of the financial year. Despite the challenging operating environment and the state of the global economy, the outlook for the Retail & Commerce segment remains moderate. The market outlook for the Utilities segment is stable, and the Nordic market offers growth opportunities for both the software and consulting businesses. Profit Guidance 2025 Comparable revenue will decrease slightly, while the comparable operating result will improve significantly. Excluding the divested healthcare software solutions business, comparable revenue was EUR 48,818 thousand in the financial year 2024. Comparable operating result for the financial year 2024 was EUR 710 thousand.

We see standard software for government evolving into a large industry, challenging the dominance of traditional suppliers. With more than 15 years of experience, a strong product position, and solid customer references, we look confidently toward the next decade. We aim to take a leadership position within the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software for government industry, and we have refined our strategy accordingly. Our dual go-to-market approach balances depth with focus: we continue to build our core business around large account customers (“super accounts”), while in parallel pursuing global leadership in selected niches where F2 becomes a category-defining standard. With F2, we are shaping the future of COTS for government. Our product roadmap is driven by a unique technology position: a complete and fully integrated platform, standard software purpose-built for government, while offering easy configuration to meet customer requirements without any modification to the core software. We maintain our full year guidance Revenue for the first half of 2025 amounts to DKK 132 million, this is down 5% from DKK 139 million in the same period of 2024. Earnings before tax (EBT) total DKK 31 million, corresponding to an EBT margin of 24%. Software revenue for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 100 million, a decrease of 10% compared to DKK 111 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower international license sales. Revenue from one-time software licenses declined by 58%, making up 14% of total revenue. Services revenue increased by 15% to DKK 32 million, representing 24% of total revenue. Recurring revenue (subscriptions) grew by 24% and represent 61% of total revenue, up from approximately 47% last year. While revenue for the first half of the year was lower due to a decline in one-time software license sales, we are encouraged by the solid performance of recurring revenue streams. The first half demonstrates a strong underlying business, with subscriptions growing 24% and services revenue increasing 15%. In addition, the solid EBT margin of 24% generated a strong positive operating cash flow of DKK 40 million. The one-time software license decline, reflects timing-related factors and market-specific delays. Given the short delivery cycles for one-time licenses, revenue is directly impacted by fluctuations in procurement schedules. In the second quarter, some Danish government organizations postponed procurements due to internal planning processes and resort changes, affecting the timing of recognized revenue. Similar to Denmark, delays in international projects have impacted results, representing a key driver of lower one-time license revenue. We maintain our full-year guidance, growing revenue 10-15% with an EBT margin of 18-23%. For the second half, we forecast continued growth in recurring licenses, and expect one-time licenses to reach a level that secures the same total volume of one-time licenses in 2025 as in 2024. In Denmark, we expect postponed procurements to be completed. Internationally, we anticipate projects across the USA, Germany, the UAE, and Africa to drive growth in one-time license revenue. Focused on long-term growth through strategic investments During the spring, cBrain (NASDAQ: CBRAIN) has taken internal steps to strengthen its organization with the aim of taking a leadership position in the fast-emerging global market for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for governments. This includes developing go-to-market strategies and establishing dedicated teams to build and lead global niches such as paperless ministry and environmental permitting. During the first half year, cBrain has been able to report progress in both verticals, with the Kenyan ministry of ICT running a pilot project and supporting the new U.S. government standard for environmental permitting. We believe the global COTS for government opportunity is significant. We have therefore also adopted a long-term perspective, even if this may affect short-term performance. cBrain has the financial strength to execute on this strategy. These changes have influenced the first half results, as we are reallocating project resources. In the beginning of the year, we allocated extra costs of 30 million DKK to support the organizational development and market investments. Until now we have allocated a smaller part of these investments, and we continue to evaluate opportunities. Thriving toward global leadership in the Paperless Ministry market The setup and configuration of cBrain F2 ® for ministries, used by Danish ministries as their digital platform, is referred to as the Paperless Ministry solution. A key pillar of the expanded growth strategy is to replicate the Danish success, and with Denmark ranked number one in the United Nations E-Government Survey for the past eight years, cBrain holds a strong reference position when exporting the Paperless Ministry solution. By establishing beachheads in new international markets, based on a vertical go-to-market approach centered around the Paperless Ministry offering, the goal is to achieve global niche leadership and secure a strong foundation for future growth. To support this, cBrain is building an internal team, dedicated to export the F2 Paperless Ministry solution globally. During the first half year, cBrain has taken a number of important steps in the market. In Kenya, cBrain has successfully configured F2 for the Kenyan ICT Ministry, ready-to-go live within only 10 weeks. This was achieved by copying and adapting the F2 configuration used by the Danish ministries. In June, the Kenyan ICT Ministry revealed plans to roll out the F2 digital platform across all government departments, thereby transitioning into paperless working environments. The Kenyan project stands out as a strong reference for cBrain when engaging with potential ministerial customers in other parts of the world. Working in close collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and UNDP, cBrain plans to market the African version of the F2 Paperless Ministry across Africa. Many African government organizations focus on digitization as a key driver of GDP growth and as a foundation for building accountable and sustainable institutions. With the African Paperless Ministry solution, configured and proven through the Danish-Kenyan ministerial collaboration, cBrain now offers the African region a unique, secure, and fast track to digital transformation, while addressing a large number of potential government customers. During the spring, cBrain has further developed the collaboration with the UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi, and in March cBrain presented the African initiatives, which are closely aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, at the United Nations Science and Technology conference in New York. cBrain has a special focus on Germany and has established initial contacts with a number of German ministries at both federal and regional level. The new German government leadership has a strong focus on digitization, and cBrain believes that reusing Danish government experiences can help accelerate German government digital transformation. In Denmark, cBrain recently announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality to deliver the paperless ministry solution for one of the municipality departments. This agreement indicates a larger market, beyond the initial focus at federal ministries, delivering the paperless ministry solution for local government. Advancing digital sovereignty with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs Driven by the new and rapidly changing global geopolitical situation, digital sovereignty is becoming increasingly important for governments across the world. During the spring, cBrain entered into collaboration with the Danish Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the government’s ambition of strengthening digital sovereignty. As part of this initiative, the Ministry launched a pilot project to test the use of open-source document editing integrated into the cBrain F2 platform. Technically, the cBrain F2 platform is built on an open architecture that separates data from editing tools. This design supports digital sovereignty by giving government users the freedom to use multiple types of editing software in parallel. The project is driven by the political objective of reducing dependency on international software vendors. Leveraging F2’s open architecture, the pilot enables ministry staff to work with open-source editing tools such as Collabora, while ensuring full data integrity, template compliance, and seamless collaboration across environments. Through this work, cBrain demonstrates how F2 supports digital sovereignty by offering governments an open and flexible platform that allows freedom of choice regarding editing tools, without compromising on security. The outcome of this pilot may serve as a blueprint for other ministries in Denmark and abroad, further strengthening cBrain’s position as a trusted partner for governments seeking independence in their digital infrastructures. Building a global Environmental Permitting market vertical As a second pillar of its expanded growth strategy, cBrain has identified environmental permitting as a key international vertical, aiming to establish a leading global position in this market with the cBrain F2 Environmental Permitting solution. The importance of environmental assessment and permitting grows globally, and governments are increasingly requiring robust review and approval processes for infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, mines, factories, and power plants. This trend creates a significant market opportunity for cBrain. In collaboration with the Danish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cBrain has developed a fully digital permitting solution based on the cBrain F2 platform. This solution replaces traditional paper-based applications, reduces case processing times, and enhances both quality and transparency. In July 2024, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued a report to Congress that assesses and recommends technologies to improve environmental reviews and permitting processes. In this report, the cBrain F2 Platform was highlighted as a successful process and AI tool for environmental permitting. To support international scaling, cBrain has formed a dedicated team focused on exporting the F2 Environmental Permitting solution and views environmental permitting as a strategic entry point into the U.S. market. cBrain seeks to capitalize on first-mover advantage in the environmental permitting market The White House issued in April 2025 an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to adopt digital technologies to streamline environmental permitting. 30 days later, the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) released the Permitting Technology Action Plan and introduced a new set of federal data standards for digital permitting systems. cBrain has rapidly configured its F2 Environmental Permitting solution to align with these standards and, in July 2025, cBrain demonstrated the adapted solution to U.S. federal authorities in Washington, D.C. cBrain believes it is among the very first vendors to support the new CEQ standards. This early alignment provides a first-mover advantage, and cBrain is experiencing an increased interest in its permitting technology as federal and state agencies are seeking to provide answers to political demand for faster permitting through digital modernization. Continued success in Denmark The Danish market represents a strong international reference position for cBrain, today serving more than 75 Danish government organizations with a large catalog of citizen-facing solutions, from tax solutions and auditing to grants management, inspections, licensing, and family affairs. cBrain continues to win market shares in Denmark. New Danish Ministry ready to go live within 3 Weeks In January, cBrain announced an agreement to deliver the F2 Paperless Ministry solution for the new Danish Ministry of Resilience and Preparedness. F2 ministry solution was installed and configured, ready to go live in only 3 weeks. This project demonstrates the power of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) for government solutions. Using traditional software solution architectures, digitizing an entire ministry normally takes years and often fails. In contrast, the cBrain F2 platform offers a secure and cost efficient solution that can be easily configured to support fast track digital transformation within a matter of weeks. Demonstrating the speed of delivery and expanding the Danish reference position directly supports the aim to take global leadership, supplying the F2 Paperless Ministry solution. Danish Energy Agency goes live with heat pump grant system, approving first applications in minutes With references across multiple Danish agencies, cBrain is building a solid market position supplying F2 based solutions for grant management. In March, the Danish Energy Agency successfully launched its new digital grant management approval system for the heat pump subsidy program, delivering fast and efficient results beyond expectations. The new grant management solution is based on the cBrain F2 platform, which has been configured to support, all steps end-to-end, from self-service to case processing, evaluation, and filing. According to agency executives the system exceeded all expectations. During the first minutes, the F2 Based solution automatically granted approval to 930 of the applicants. Due to automated case processing steps, combined with automated integrations into multiple national registers, the grant process has been fully automated for the majority of applications. Now only cases that need more information and special evaluation require manual interaction. The successful launch of the heat pump subsidy system underscores how smart technology, like the F2 COTS for government platform, can support faster, smarter, and more effective public services, accelerating Denmark’s green transition. Third largest Danish Municipality implements the F2 Paperless Ministry solution Early July, cBrain announced an agreement with Aalborg Municipality. cBrain will deliver F2 as a digital platform to the Urban and Rural Affairs Department in Aalborg Municipality. This administration is responsible for areas including urban development, construction, infrastructure, mobility and nature, and the implementation is expected to be completed within 6–8 weeks, with a planned go-live by September/October 2025. With this agreement, cBrain is now delivering the F2 platform for the three largest municipalities in Denmark: Copenhagen, Aarhus, and Aalborg. Fully integrated and delivered out-of-the-box, cBrain F2 supports executive decision-making, formal and informal communication, case management, workflows, and compliance. Today, Copenhagen represents the largest deployment, with more than 3,000 users. The agreement with Aalborg highlights that the F2 Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Government Platform is gaining traction not only among national ministries and agencies but also within large, complex local government organizations. Local governments thereby represent a significant market opportunity beyond the initial central government focus on Paperless Ministry, extending the reach of the cBrain F2 Paperless Government Platform to cities and local authorities internationally. In Denmark, cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution cBrain has delivered a new national hunting license solution for the Danish Agency for Green Transition and Aquatic Environment. Delivered as one fully integrated platform, F2 has been configured to support all user requirements functionality, end-to-end. Highly automated, this includes self-service and portal for more than 180,000 hunters, a registry of hunters, case processing related to issuing hunting license, managing different hunting tests for different types of weapons, game harvest reporting, police security checks, and license payments. The project demonstrates the breadth of the F2 COTS for government platform. Delivered as one fully integrated solution, F2 is able to support national registers, case processing, self-service and mass operations such as billing and payment collection. F2 for Partners The F2-for-Partners strategy is a core element of the long-term growth plan. By establishing an ecosystem of partners and customers who manage the consulting work related to implementing and servicing F2 solutions, cBrain can scale its business without revenue growth being directly constrained by the burden of organizational expansion. At the core of this strategy are the F2 Service Builder no-code configuration tools. The F2 Service Builder allows local partners and governments to independently design and build F2-based government solutions. Solutions are configured using a spreadsheet interface, enabling users without a technical background to create solutions. The configured solutions are stored as open source definitions in so-called process libraries. The combination of open source and process libraries makes it easy to reuse solutions simply by copying and adapting the process definition source code. The F2 Service Builder technology thus enables rapid development and reuse, helping governments accelerate digital transformation and scale solutions efficiently. Working with UNDP, aligning with the Digital offer for Africa strategy In November 2024, UNDP and cBrain signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Aligned with the UNDP Digital Offer for Africa strategy, the partnership aims to accelerate digital transformation of governments and their citizens in the African region. During the spring, cBrain has initiated an F2 process library at UNDP Resilience Hub in Nairobi. Working in collaboration with UNDP and Danish government, the process library will form the platform for developing and scaling best practice solutions for government across the region, using inclusion, capacity, economy, and resilience as key strategic pillars. When the partnership was announced, Ahunna Eziakonwa, UN Assistant-Secretary General and UNDP’s Regional Bureau for Africa Director, stated: “Digital is the lifeline to opportunity in Africa, and it should not remain a luxury. With the right partners like Denmark and cBrain, we can expand critical access to information and education, and unlock innovation at scale, thus bridging divides and empowering millions to shape a more equal and prosperous future in Africa”. In parallel, the Ambassador of Denmark in Nairobi, Stephan Schönemann, stated: “cBrain is a leading Danish software company, promoting digitalization as a driver for good governance. Their collaboration with UNDP can help drive the sustainable development and digital transformation across the African continent. This collaboration echoes the spirit of the Danish government’s new Africa strategy which places a strong emphasis on technology, public-private partnerships, democracy, and knowledge sharing”. First large scale project in Romania In December 2024, cBrain’s partner in Romania, Wing Leading Edge, has won a public tender to deliver a new national platform for administering citizen pensions. The solution is being delivered in the Romanian language, with cBrain operating as a sub-supplier. Using the F2 Service Builder and process libraries, F2 is now being configured as the case management and processing core, supporting close to 100 different administrative processes and integrating with multiple other systems. cBrain sees the Romanian pension project as a milestone both technically and strategically. The project demonstrates the capabilities of the F2 Service Builder and process library technology, and it highlights the early success of the F2-for-Partners strategy. F2 AI Assistant offers government AI on premise AI is emerging as a transformative technology for governments worldwide. For cBrain, AI is not a separate product but an integrated part of our strategy to deliver Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software for government. We embed AI directly into the F2 platform, ensuring that it supports caseworkers and managers in their daily work, and due to our unique technology, the F2 Assistant runs on premise, thereby safeguarding the principles of security, transparency, and data sovereignty. We continue to develop the F2 AI Assistant, adding new capabilities during the first half new capability. Operating fully within the secure F2 environment, the AI Assistant can summarize documents, propose case-relevant actions, and support knowledge sharing across organizations, always under the control and without compromising sovereignty. We see AI not only as a driver of efficiency but also as a catalyst for redefining digital government operations, further strengthening F2 as a category-defining standard in the global COTS software for government industry. Shaping the future of government software Already into the last quarters of our 2023–2025 growth plan, we are very encouraged by the progress. With a strong product position and strong customers references, supported by a solid financial position, we see cBrain well-positioned for the decade ahead. We are confident that our strategy, built on taking leadership in COTS for government industry, will enable us to capture the opportunities of a fast-emerging market and secure long-term, sustainable growth.

We are the first defence and security industry company on the First North Growth Market marketplaces in Stockholm and Helsinki. The directed share issue arranged for the share exchange significantly strengthened the company's equity, and our financial position is strong. The amount of investments raised in connection with the corporate transactions was EUR 28.15 million. At the end of June, the company was net debt-free, and our equity ratio was 63.4%. Investments in new production facilities In line with our strategy, we have been able to quickly support the operations of our subsidiaries and secure financing and working capital for product development, internationalization and next-stage corporate transactions. After the merger, our subsidiary Uudenkaupungin Työvene acquired the property of Olkiluoto shipyard to increase its production capacity, and Lightspace Technologies announced an investment in its production facility in Ventspils, Latvia, to improve its cleanroom production capacity. In addition, our subsidiaries have several ongoing product development projects. The new production facilities of the Summa Drones business have been put into operation in Southern Finland, and the first test batch is being manufactured with our Ukrainian partner. We expect the first production batches to be completed and deliveries to begin during the second half of the year. Pro forma net sales increased by 35 per cent Several of our subsidiaries have already increased their net sales significantly compared to the previous year. In January–June 2025, our pro forma net sales were EUR 42.1 million, compared to EUR 31.1 million a year earlier. The net sales of our companies increased by more than 35 per cent in the first half of the year. Net sales in Summa Defence's continuing operations focusing on defence and security were EUR 34.9 (25.3) million and in the Renewable Energy business EUR 7.2 (5.8) million. Profitability improved During the first half of the year, our profitability also started to improve clearly, although the delay in the transaction slowed down the growth of the business volume of our subsidiaries. The profitability of our continuing operations was already slightly positive in the first half of the year, but Group administration expenses (EUR -1.9 million) and the result of the Renewable Energy business (EUR -1.9 million) pushed the pro forma adjusted operating profit to EUR -3.7 (-5.2) million. In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year.

In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year.

We are the first defence and security industry company on the First North Growth Market marketplaces in Stockholm and Helsinki. The directed share issue arranged for the share exchange significantly strengthened the company's equity, and our financial position is strong. The amount of investments raised in connection with the corporate transactions was EUR 28.15 million. At the end of June, the company was net debt-free, and our equity ratio was 63.4%. Investments in new production facilities In line with our strategy, we have been able to quickly support the operations of our subsidiaries and secure financing and working capital for product development, internationalization and next-stage corporate transactions. After the merger, our subsidiary Uudenkaupungin Työvene acquired the property of Olkiluoto shipyard to increase its production capacity, and Lightspace Technologies announced an investment in its production facility in Ventspils, Latvia, to improve its cleanroom production capacity. In addition, our subsidiaries have several ongoing product development projects. The new production facilities of the Summa Drones business have been put into operation in Southern Finland, and the first test batch is being manufactured with our Ukrainian partner. We expect the first production batches to be completed and deliveries to begin during the second half of the year. Pro forma net sales increased by 35 per cent Several of our subsidiaries have already increased their net sales significantly compared to the previous year. In January–June 2025, our pro forma net sales were EUR 42.1 million, compared to EUR 31.1 million a year earlier. The net sales of our companies increased by more than 35 per cent in the first half of the year. Net sales in Summa Defence's continuing operations focusing on defence and security were EUR 34.9 (25.3) million and in the Renewable Energy business EUR 7.2 (5.8) million. Profitability improved During the first half of the year, our profitability also started to improve clearly, although the delay in the transaction slowed down the growth of the business volume of our subsidiaries. The profitability of our continuing operations was already slightly positive in the first half of the year, but Group administration expenses (EUR -1.9 million) and the result of the Renewable Energy business (EUR -1.9 million) pushed the pro forma adjusted operating profit to EUR -3.7 (-5.2) million. In most of our businesses, there was a clear turnaround in profitability, and in some companies, operating profit rose to positive numbers. The profitability of the Renewable Energy business has been burdened by delays in customer deliveries of large plants. In addition, industrial investments in low-carbon solutions have been slowed down by the uncertain political climate, especially in Germany, the challenging nature of project financing, the slowness of support systems and the strong focus of public budgeting on defence investments. We have started measures to improve the profitability of the business area. Change negotiations have been initiated in the unit. Thanks to the strong market situation, we expect the growth of our companies to accelerate and the turnaround in profitability to accelerate during the rest of the year. Closer cooperation with the defence sector Our subsidiaries have a long and extensive history as partners in the defence sector around the world. Summa Defence and its subsidiaries will continue and develop this good cooperation together in the future as well. With the funding and support of the Summa Defence Group, our subsidiaries can make quick investment decisions, scale up production quickly and increase production to a whole new level. At the end of June, our subsidiaries had a strong order book of more than EUR 160 million. Over the years, the value of deliveries from our subsidiaries to the defence and armed forces of various countries and other security authorities has been approximately EUR 300 million, and demand continues at a good level. I would like to thank our customers, partners, investors and personnel for a successful merger and the first half of the year.

This was driven by continued growth in Endoscopy Solutions, which grew 15.9%, and solid performance in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, which grew 6.4%. This brings the organic growth for the first nine months to 14.3% and the EBIT margin to 13.9%. The financial guidance for organic revenue growth for 2024/25 is updated to reflect the continued solid growth and is now expected to be 12-14% (previously 11-14%). “I am pleased with the continued solid growth momentum in our third quarter. With 15.9% growth in Endoscopy Solutions and portfolio expansions in pulmonology and urology, we are deepening our presence in high-growth markets. On the back of solid revenue performance in Endoscopy Solutions and strong growth in Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring, we are raising the lower end of our organic revenue guidance to 12-14% for the full year. We maintain our EBIT margin guidance, supported by solid organic growth and operational leverage, even as we navigate FX and tariff-related dynamics. I want to thank our teams for their dedication and execution, which makes this continued progress possible. We look forward to welcoming institutional investors, analysts, and financial media to attend our Capital Markets Day on 1 October 2025, where we will share insights on strategy and market opportunities.” BRITT MEELBY JENSEN Chief Executive Officer Q3 HIGHLIGHTS Business highlights Advancing pulmonology market leadership position with the expansion of Ambu® SureSight™ Connect video laryngoscopy solution for pediatric patients. Strengthened urology offering with FDA clearance for Ambu® aScope™ 5 Cysto HD cysto-nephroscope for PCNL procedures.

Scott Heinzelman appointed new President for North America and member of Ambu’s Executive Leadership Team, as of 25 August. Financial highlights Revenue increased organically by 12.0% (15.0%) to DKK 1,507m (DKK 1,383m), with reported growth of 9.0% (15.7%). Organic growth for the first nine months was 14.3% (14.9%), with reported growth of 14.2% (12.9%). Endoscopy Solutions increased organically by 15.9% (18.0%). The Pulmonology business group posted 11.2% (9.9%) organic growth, positively impacted by continued aScope™ 5 Broncho adoption, as well as the newly launched video laryngoscopy solution. The Urology, ENT, & GI business group posted 20.8% (27.6%) organic growth, mainly driven by the aScope™ 4 portfolio, with sustained strong growth momentum for aScope™ 5 Uretero. Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring increased organically by 6.4% (10.9%) and by 11.1% (6.4%) for the first nine months, driven by both volume and price increases. EBIT before special items (b.s.i.) was DKK 170m (DKK 178m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 11.3% (12.9%). EBIT b.s.i. for the first nine months ended at DKK 637m (DKK 498m), with an EBIT margin b.s.i. of 13.9% (12.4%). EBIT margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs but positively impacted by continued operational leverage from solid organic growth. Free cash flow (FCF) before acquisitions totaled DKK 128m (DKK 163m), leaving FCF for the first nine months to DKK 277m. This was impacted by continued higher net working capital to mitigate the global geopolitical uncertainties and support growth, and profitability was impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs. As a result, FCF assumptions for FY 2024/25 are now DKK ~400m (previously DKK +500m). Raise of lower end of organic revenue guidance to 12-14% (previously 11-14%), driven by continued procedure growth and conversion towards single-use solutions. EBIT margin b.s.i. guidance is maintained, with investments continuing as planned to support long-term growth, despite FX headwind and increased tariff costs. 2024/25 financial guidance: Organic revenue growth : 12-14% (previously 11-14%) EBIT margin b.s.i. : 13-15% Q3 2024/25 conference call A conference call is broadcast live today, 22 August 2025 at 11:00 (CEST), via ambu.com/webcastQ32025 .

The Urology, ENT, & GI business group posted 20.8% (27.6%) organic growth, mainly driven by the aScope™ 4 portfolio, with sustained strong growth momentum for aScope™ 5 Uretero. Anesthesia & Patient Monitoring increased organically by 6.4% (10.9%) and by 11.1% (6.4%) for the first nine months, driven by both volume and price increases.

EBIT margin for the quarter was negatively impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs but positively impacted by continued operational leverage from solid organic growth. Free cash flow (FCF) before acquisitions totaled DKK 128m (DKK 163m), leaving FCF for the first nine months to DKK 277m. This was impacted by continued higher net working capital to mitigate the global geopolitical uncertainties and support growth, and profitability was impacted by both FX headwind and tariff costs.

The operating result for the review period was EUR -2.8 million (-2.7), and the profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). Order book increased by 18% from the end of December last year (H2 2024: 22.2) and amounted to EUR 26.0 million (27.0) at the end of review period. January-June 2025 Honkarakenne Group’s net sales in January–June amounted to EUR 16.7 million (H1 2024: 14.5). Net sales increased by 15% from the corresponding period of the previous year. Operating profit was EUR -2.8 million (-2.7). Profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). Earnings per share was EUR -0.39 (-0.46). The Group’s financial position is strong, with equity ratio of 52.3% (55.7) and net financial liabilities of EUR -0.8 million (-3.2). Honkarakenne’s guidance for 2025 remains unchanged from the guidance updated on 12 February 2025. According to Honkarakenne’s view, the Group’s net sales in 2025 will be slightly higher than in the previous guidance and amount to EUR 38-45 million. The Group’s operating profit is EUR -2.6 – -0.0 million. GROUP’S KEY FIGURES 1–6/2025 1–6/2024 1–12/2024 Net sales, EUR million 16.7 14.5 36.7 Operating profit/loss, EUR million -2.8 -2.7 -2.4 Profit/loss before taxes, EUR million -2.9 -3.3 -2.6 Average number of employees 158 167 157 Average number of employees in person-years 155 159 153 Earnings per share, EUR -0.39 -0.46 -0.37 Equity ratio, % 52.3 55.7 59.7 Return on equity, % -18.6 -18.2 -14.3 Equity per share, EUR 1.93 2.23 2.32 Gearing ratio, % -7.4 -24.6 -3.5 Honkarakenne Oyj’s CEO Marko Saarelainen commented on the half-year report as follows: “As the review period began, the outlook for Finland's housing and construction industry was very challenging. The order intake for the first quarter declined slightly compared to last year. In early summer, the order intake developed positively, and the order book for the review period rose to EUR 26.2 million, an 18% increase from the end of last year. Despite increased net sales and efficiency measures, the operating profit landed in the red at EUR -2.8 million. Profit before tax improved EUR 0.4 million compared to last year but remained loss-making at EUR -2.9 million. Profitability was impacted by the sales mix being weighted towards domestic sales, as the export being lower than in the comparison period. Despite of cost reductions, fixed costs remained too high relative to net sales. This was partly influenced by development projects planned to support future growth and their implementation despite the challenging market conditions. In the domestic B2C business, consumer caution in decision-making was reflected in the order intake for the first half of the year. The domestic B2C business was able to increase net sales compared to last year, but profitability faced challenges. Overall the domestic business result was a hard-won victory in a challenging market, but looking ahead, the business requires efficiency measures to improve profitability. The project business achieved significant percentage growth, but the volume is still quite small. The B2B business began to be actively developed early in the year, both domestically and in exports. The B2B project pipeline is growing, and the outlook in this regard is cautiously positive. In the export business, order intake from Asia fell short of the comparison period. Uncertainties regarding Japanese regulatory requirements have slowed down business during the review period. The situation regarding Japan is likely to continue similarly in the latter half of the year. Order intake in the APAC region remained at the previous year's level, but no net sales were yet recognized during H1. Construction of the first phase of the India project progressed after the review period to a launch event held in July, where guests were able to hear about Honkarakenne's products, get acquainted with completed buildings, and the overall plan for the area development project. The European market area was slightly below the comparison year's order intake, excluding Germany, where orders received and net sales accumulated for the period were growing. Due to the development efforts of the German team, the company expects positive growth in order intake and net sales for consumer and project customers. The outlook for the rest of Europe remains partly challenging. Preparations for the production start of the new non-settling log, launched in May, were made during the first half of the year. After the review period, production of the new non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, started and the first deliveries to customers were made in early August. In the challenging geopolitical situation and Finland's historically weak construction industry cycle, I believe the company's resources, such as its strong market position, robust balance sheet, good financial standing, skilled personnel, and excellent product and collection, will provide Honka with a significant competitive advantage compared to its competitors."" NET SALES Honkarakenne Group’s net sales for the first half of 2025 increased by 15% to EUR 16.7 million (14.5). Honkarakenne presents its set sales data divided in two parts: Finland and Exports. Below we present the net sales based on this division for the first half of 2025 and the second half of 2024 with the comparison year.

This was driven by higher sales in both the domestic consumer business and the project and export business compared to the first and especially the last half of last year. Order book refers to orders with a delivery date within the next 24 months. Some orders may have a financing or building permit condition. TRENDS IN PROFIT AND PFOFITABILITY Operating profit for the review period stood at EUR -2.8 million (-2.7) and the profit before taxes was EUR -2.9 million (-3.3). The lower profitability compared to comparison period was impacted by the sales mix being weighted towards domestic business, as the share of exports remained below the comparison period. Some domestic deliveries included winter seasons installation campaigns carried out late last year, which had lower profitability than normally. In addition, fixed costs during the review period were higher than in the comparison period, even though there were cost reductions in operations and temporary layoffs. FINANCING AND INVESTMENT At the end of the review period, Honkarakenne’s financial position was good. The Group’s equity ratio was 52.3% (55.7%) and net gearing ratio was -7.4% (-24.6%). The Group’s net financial liabilities amounted to EUR -0.8 million (-3.2), so the Group’s liquid assets exceeded its financial liabilities. The Group’s liquid assets totalled EUR 5.0 million (6.9). The Group also has a EUR 3.0 (3.0) overdraft facility, which has not been used in the review period or the comparison period. The Group’s gross investments amounted to EUR 0.7 million (0.7), excluding right-of-use assets in accordance with the IFRS 16 standard. Investments during the period mainly related to the replacement investment in the non-settling logs production line at the Karstula mill. PRODUCTS AND MARKET AREAS Honka's collection is being renewed and developed in a market-specific and customer-centric manner, and the design of the collections strongly focuses on the quality of living and the sustainability of buildings. Honka's convertible models are designed to enable a wide range of lifestyle variations, eliminating the need to build or buy new homes when life situations change, and ensuring there is no need to give up a natural, sustainable log house with healthy indoor air quality. In May, the company launched a new fourth-generation non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, whose wider-than-before vertical middle lamella increases the stability of log walls, enabling the construction of even larger projects such as apartment buildings and schools. In addition, the new log features an advanced design profile and a minimal seam groove between the logs, facilitating an easier implementation of modern architecture and various interior styles, as well as the combination of the log with other building materials such as glass, stone and steel. In connection with the launch, interior design concepts supporting the design of interior decoration for Honka log homes and holiday homes, along with the related HonkaLook Book brochure, were published. During the review period, the development of cost-effective leisure home and detached house models for the Finnish and Nordic markets continued, and new collection brochures for the Finnish market were released. In addition, larger-scale Honka Grand Design house models, featuring international architecture, were unveiled, specifically aimed at the company's international markets. Additionally, in the spring, the Pineo accommodation concept, targeted at international and domestic tourism and accommodation businesses, was launched, complete with buildings of various sizes. After the review period, Honka was an exhibitor at the Oulu Housing Fair in Honka Kömmeli, which received great interest. The show home is an architect-designed, individually tailored log house for a young couple building their first home, which features a traditional Finnish loft sauna. The log building represents a modern interpretation of the traditional architecture of the coastal region and the classic red ochre colour. Honka’s operations are certified with the ISO 9001 quality standard and the ISO 14001 environmental standard. In Finland , net sales were 27% higher than in the same period last year at EUR 13.4 million (10.6). The net sales growth resulted from a slightly higher order intake in the project and consumer businesses from the previous year, as well as sales from the beginning of the year that were delivered during the review period. During the review period, domestic orders received were lower than in the comparison period for the consumer business and the project business. The domestic operating environment is still awaiting a more meaningful recovery in terms of construction and new delivery agreements. Demand and order backlog are showing moderate growth. Final decisions on construction starts are delayed or further postponed in the uncertain economic situation. The company expects domestic demand to pick up and turn more favourable, also regarding construction starts. For the remainder of the year, new orders are estimated to reach the previous year's level or slightly higher, particularly in the project business and leisure homes. In exports , net sales were 16% lower than in the corresponding period of the previous year at EUR 3.3 million (3.9). The decline in revenue during the review period was primarily due to the varying delivery schedules of projects under delivery. These were individual deliveries of detached houses and holiday homes mainly to sites located in the Asian and European regions. Received orders were at the comparison period's level, and regional variations across different export countries are significant. In the European region, demand has finally picked up, leading to larger orders as well. Demand and orders received from the Asian region have remained stable. Exports are seeing increased demand and prospects, particularly for various-sized projects. These involve uncertainty regarding the timeframe within which demand could materialize and lead to new orders. Uncertainty regarding the operating environment outlook may weaken and curb increased demand and expected export growth. STRATEGY 2025-2028 The company specified the objectives of its strategy extending to the end of 2024 to better reflect the changes in the operating environment. Through the strategy, Honkarakenne's position as Finland's largest exporter of wooden buildings will be strengthened. With the export and customer experience strategy, the Group aims for controlled growth in net sales during the strategy period, with the focus on profitability. The performance targets are based on process efficiency, conceptualization, and management, which also improve customer and employee experience. Honkarakenne Group's vision is to offer truly the best living. The Group’s mission is to improve the quality of people’s lives and housing. Honkarakenne’s strategic objectives for the 2025–2028 period are: Strengthening customer experience Effectiveness in everything Renewable Honka spirit Managed international operations To implement the strategy, development projects and focus areas supporting the strategy's progress are refined within the Group's extended management team, in accordance with the Objectives and key results model. Honkarakenne states that it does not consider long-term targets as market guidance for any particular year of the strategy period. SUSTAINABILITY Sustainability is a key part of Honkarakenne’s strategy. Honkarakenne Group is continuously developing its production, services and selection to enable healthier, more ecological and better-quality living. Group focuses on building the future and choices are guided by human and natural vitality. Honkarakenne’s sustainability programme, `We are building the future’, is based on the changes we have identified in our operating environment, our ethical principles, recognised expectations of our staff and other stakeholders, and understanding the customer in our markets. As part of Honkarakenne's sustainability programme, the parent company uses 100% electricity produced with renewable energy and certified with a guarantee of origin with carbon dioxide emissions of 0 g/kWh at all its own sites. Honkarakenne also promotes sustainability through its various product solutions. In conjunction with the Rock and Star collection, which was launched during the period, Honka Säästö introduced a solution for safely shutting off both water and heat in living spaces. The solution allows the cottage to be kept unheated in the living areas during the winter season without the risk of freezing water pipes or damaging appliances. Logs as a breathable structure enable sustainable construction and, with the Honka Säästö solution, also electricity savings. THE HONKA BRAND The core of the Honka brand is the close relationship with nature and Finnish happiness. Honka's yellow is the colour of hope and joy. Honka helps every customer realize the dreams that are important to them and Honka has the honour to convey the vitality of the northern forests. SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS Honkarakenne operates in a business that is seasonal by nature. Especially in Finland, construction mostly takes place during summer, so there are more deliveries in summer and autumn than during the winter. Considering the existing market and demand conditions, the company aims to even out this seasonality especially with export activities. During the review period, the company's market situation was challenging in all its areas. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Group’s R&D costs in January-June were EUR 0.2 million (0.3), which was 1.0% (1.8%) of net sales. During the review period, a new fourth-generation non-settling log, Honka Fusion+, was developed, featuring a vertical middle lamella that is wider than before, increasing the stability of log walls and enabling the construction of increasingly larger buildings such as apartment buildings and schools. The new log was launched on the market in the spring and will go into production in early autumn. Honka’s interior design concepts and related new product solutions were developed. New concepts and products, including interior panels, were launched in the spring. During the review period, product solutions for larger buildings continued to be developed, including for the needs of the Honka MultiStorey™ building concept. In addition, the development of the Honka Healthy House™ concept was continued, and the concept was introduced to international markets early in the year. The aim of development projects is to increase the use of wood in construction to promote climate targets. Wood is renewable raw material and wood construction is part of sustainable use of forests. The Group has not capitalized development costs during the review period. PERSONNEL The Group’s average number of personnel, measured in person-years, totalled 155 (159) persons during the first half of the year. The decrease from the comparison period was 4 people. The Group’s average number of personnel, measured by employment relationships was 158 (167) during the first half of the year. During both the review period and the comparison period, the parent company's personnel were laid off varying periods due to low demand, low production and delivery volumes, as well as during a production stoppage, when the installation of a new non-settling log line was carried out. In March 2024, the Board of Directors of the parent company decided, on a share-based incentive program for senior management for the years 2024–2026. The purpose of the plan is to align key employees with the company's objectives and to incentivise the creation of shareholder value. The Performance-Based Share Plan 2024–2026 has a three-year vesting period and the metrics for the period are net sales and operating profit margin. Five people participate in the 2024–2026 incentive program, and the rewards correspond to a maximum of 75,000 shares in total. There were no expenses related to the incentive scheme during the reporting period. In March, a joint staff day was held at the Karstula factory for personnel and domestic representatives. In addition to spending time together, they were able to familiarize themselves with the production line for the new non-settling log, which was completed earlier this year, and learn about its operations. EXECUTIVE GROUP During the review period the Executive Group consisted of: Marko Saarelainen, CEO; Eino Hekali, Vice President, Product; Maarit Jylhä, CFO; Petri Perttula, Business Vice President, Operations Global B2B; and Juhani Saukko, Business Vice President, Operations Finland B2C.

The company’s share capital has not changed, remaining at EUR 9,897,936.00. Each class B share entitles to one (1) vote and a class A share to twenty (20) votes, bringing to total number of votes conferred by the shares during the review period to 11,913,243. Honkarakenne’s class B shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd’s Small Cap list with the ticker HONBS. The highest price of the listed class B share was EUR 3.05, and the lowest price was EUR 2.37.

At the end of the report period, the parent company held 321,052 of its own Series B shares with a total purchase price of EUR 1,186,556.34. Own shares account for 5.17% of all Honkarakenne shares and 2.69% of all votes. The acquisition cost of own shares reduces the free equity of both the parent company and the Group. FLAGGING NOTIFICATIONS No flagging notifications were received during the review period. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Honkarakenne Oyj complied with the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies issued by the Securities Market Association in 2025. For more information about corporate governance, go to SHORT-TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES The main risks and uncertainties of Honkarakenne relate to negative changes in the operating environment of the company and its customers, increased costs of raw materials and components, their availability and the functioning of the overall supply chains. If demand falls sharply in the operating environment and costs remain high, it may have significant effects on the company’s earnings development. The economic uncertainty in the Group’s operating environment is negatively reflected in business and consumer confidence. Economic risks continue to be driven by consumer confidence and employment concerns, inflation, interest rates and access to financing. The uncertainty of the military aggression initiated by Russia and all its effects on business are difficult to assess. Replacing the order book lost in the Russian and Ukrainian market area with other export markets may be prolonged or uncertain in the current global market situation. If the war is further prolonged or escalates, or if the instability in the Middle East would spread more widely, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group's business, financial position and results of operations. The valuation of items in the balance sheet is based on the management’s current estimates. Any changes to these estimates may affect the company’s financial performance. REPORTING This report contains statements that relate to the future, and these statements are based on hypotheses that the company's management hold currently, and on the decisions and plans that are currently in place. Although the management believes that the hypotheses relating to the future are well-founded, there is no guarantee that the said hypotheses will prove to be correct. The half-year report has not been audited and the figures are unaudited. Figures in brackets refer to the corresponding period one year earlier, unless otherwise stated. Honkarakenne complies with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). An APM is a financial measure of performance other than a financial measure defined or specified in IFRS. Therefore, instead of the previous term ‘without non-recurring items’, the term ‘adjusted’ is used. The company classifies significant business transactions that are considered to affect comparisons between different reporting periods as adjustment items. Such transactions include significant reorganisation expenses, significant impairment losses or reversals thereof, significant capital gains and losses on assets, and other significant non-customary income or expenses. This half-year report bulletin has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34. The half-year report bulletin should be read together with the 2024 financial statements. The accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are the same as in the financial statements for 2024, with the exception of standards and interpretations that have come into force on January 1 2025 or thereafter. The impact of the new standards and interpretations is described later in the section “New standards and interpretations”. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD There are no significant events. OUTLOOK FOR 2025 (published on 12 February 2025) According to Honkarakenne’s view, the Group’s net sales in 2025 will be slightly higher than in the previous guidance and amount to EUR 38-45 million. The Group’s operating profit is EUR -2.6 – -0.0 million. BASIS FOR THE OUTLOOK The company's outlook for the 2025 development is based on the existing order book, the expectation of challenges in the operating environment and on market development. Uncertainty about the development of the economic situation in Finland, interest rates and availability of financing may negatively affect demand from consumer and professional builders and their decision-making concerning construction, thus creating uncertainty in the starts of new construction projects. The company sees that strategic focus on export markets holds potential and supports profitable growth.

The impact of the new standards and interpretations is described later in the section “New stardards and interpretations”. The Financial Statement Bulletin has not been audited and the figures are unaudited.

New standards and interpretations The new standards or interpretations effective as of 1 January 2025 did not have a material impact on the figures presented for the review period. Alternative performance measures Honkarakenne complies with the Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). An APM is a financial measure of performance other than a financial measure defined or specified in IFRS. Therefore, instead of the previous term ‘without non-recurring items’, the term ‘adjusted’ is used. The company classifies significant business transactions that are considered to affect comparisons between different reporting periods as adjustment items. Such transactions include significant reorganisation expenses, significant impairment losses or reversals thereof, significant capital gains and losses on assets, and other significant non-customary income or expenses. In Honkarakenne’s view, Alternative Performance Measures provide significant additional information to management, investors, securities analysts and other parties on Honkarakenne’s operational result, financial position and cash flows, and are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties. Return on equity, equity ratio, net financial liabilities and gearing are presented as supplementary key figures, as in the company’s view they are useful indicators for assessing Honkarakenne’s ability to acquire financing and pay its debts. In addition, gross investments and R&D expenditure provide additional information on needs related to Honkarakenne’s operational cash flow. Segments Honkarakenne has two geographical operating segments that are combined into one segment for reporting purposes. Geographically, sales are divided as follows: Finland and Exports. As management’s internal reporting complies with IFRS reporting, separate reconciliations are not presented.

Currency-adjusted net sales growth amounted to -0.6% (10.5%). Operating profit amounted to tSEK 18,019 (20,964), with an operating margin of 28.4% (32.0%). The quarter has not been affected by any costs affecting comparability. The total number of paying subscribers at end of period was 878k (898k). ARPU in the quarter totaled SEK 271 (282). Currency-adjusted ARPU amounted to SEK 277. Earnings per share before and after dilution for the quarter amounted to SEK 0.71 (0.84). First half year in summary (January-June 2025) Net sales totaled tSEK 128,484 (128,899) and decreased by -0.3% (+13.0%). Currency-adjusted net sales growth amounted to 0.5% (10.8%). Operating profit amounted to tSEK 35,110 (34,807), with an operating margin of 27.3% (27.0%). The previous year was affected by costs of tSEK 5,756 and the adjusted operating margin was 31.5%. The total number of paying subscribers at end of period was 878k (898k). ARPU for the period totaled SEK 272 (279). Currency-adjusted ARPU amounted to SEK 274. Earnings per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK 1.39 (1.40) for the period. Important events during the quarter In June, Sleep Cycle initiated a clinical trial for AI-based sleep apnea screening, targeting a billion-dollar market. In June, Sleep Cycle launched an in-app collaboration with HelloFresh, Factor, and YouFoodz. Important events after the period end No significant events took place after the end of the period. Commenting on the quarter, CEO Erik Jivmark says: With a strong margin of 28.4 percent for the quarter, we are further consolidating our position as a technology leader in sleep and health. We are making progress in both clinical validation – as in our study for screening sleep apnea – and commercialization, with growing revenues from partnerships. Revenue from partnerships now accounts for over 9 percent of our net sales. At the same time, the quarter was impacted by a tougher market environment with slower customer growth and a two percent decline in paying subscribers. Market trends show that our long-term strategy is the right way forward, with a diversified offering and more verticals based on our sleep technology. PARTNERSHIPS AS GROWTH DRIVERS Partnership sales is a key part of our strategy – and it is yielding results. Revenue from partnerships has increased by over 68 percent compared to the same quarter in prior year and now accounts for more than 9 percent of our total net sales, which for the quarter amounted to SEK 63.6 million. During the quarter, we welcomed HelloFresh, Factor and YouFoodz as part of Sleep Cycle's partner program and opened up a new platform of in-app offerings, tailored to our health-conscious target audience. SCREENING FOR SLEEP APNEA ENTERS CLINICAL PHASE In June, we initiated our clinical study with over 700 participants for our AI-based screening of obstructive sleep apnea. The study is an important milestone towards medical certification and future approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The goal is to offer a simple and accessible solution without expensive hardware or the need for a sleep clinic. We envisage both a service for consumers and offers to partners available in part through licensing. TARGETED GROWTH INITIATIVES Despite a challenging market situation for sleep apps, the demand for sleep aid is high and predicted to grow in the coming years. The renewal rate is gradually improving and development is outperforming competitors thanks to targeted product development such as Sleep Stages. The number of paying subscribers is down two percent from prior year and totals 878,000 for the quarter. Developments in the sleep app segment in the AppStore demonstrate the need to expand our business and that our strategy is the right way forward. We are working decisively on new customer acquisition, activation, partnerships, and tech licensing under the Powered by Sleep Cycle concept to reverse the trend and build an even stronger Sleep Cycle. This marks a new chapter for us, and although sales cycles in B2B are longer than in the consumer business, we are confident that our technology meets a real need. We are building for long-term impact — and for a future where our technology becomes an integral part of the digital health ecosystem. The market is changing — and we are changing with it. We are not only building for better sleep, but for a greater role in digital health, public health, research, and data analysis. Thank you for your continued support and belief in our vision!

Important events during the quarter In June, Sleep Cycle initiated a clinical trial for AI-based sleep apnea screening, targeting a billion-dollar market. In June, Sleep Cycle launched an in-app collaboration with HelloFresh, Factor, and YouFoodz. Important events after the period end No significant events took place after the end of the period. Commenting on the quarter, CEO Erik Jivmark says: With a strong margin of 28.4 percent for the quarter, we are further consolidating our position as a technology leader in sleep and health. We are making progress in both clinical validation – as in our study for screening sleep apnea – and commercialization, with growing revenues from partnerships. Revenue from partnerships now accounts for over 9 percent of our net sales. At the same time, the quarter was impacted by a tougher market environment with slower customer growth and a two percent decline in paying subscribers. Market trends show that our long-term strategy is the right way forward, with a diversified offering and more verticals based on our sleep technology. PARTNERSHIPS AS GROWTH DRIVERS Partnership sales is a key part of our strategy – and it is yielding results. Revenue from partnerships has increased by over 68 percent compared to the same quarter in prior year and now accounts for more than 9 percent of our total net sales, which for the quarter amounted to SEK 63.6 million. During the quarter, we welcomed HelloFresh, Factor and YouFoodz as part of Sleep Cycle's partner program and opened up a new platform of in-app offerings, tailored to our health-conscious target audience. SCREENING FOR SLEEP APNEA ENTERS CLINICAL PHASE In June, we initiated our clinical study with over 700 participants for our AI-based screening of obstructive sleep apnea. The study is an important milestone towards medical certification and future approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The goal is to offer a simple and accessible solution without expensive hardware or the need for a sleep clinic. We envisage both a service for consumers and offers to partners available in part through licensing. TARGETED GROWTH INITIATIVES Despite a challenging market situation for sleep apps, the demand for sleep aid is high and predicted to grow in the coming years. The renewal rate is gradually improving and development is outperforming competitors thanks to targeted product development such as Sleep Stages. The number of paying subscribers is down two percent from prior year and totals 878,000 for the quarter. Developments in the sleep app segment in the AppStore demonstrate the need to expand our business and that our strategy is the right way forward. We are working decisively on new customer acquisition, activation, partnerships, and tech licensing under the Powered by Sleep Cycle concept to reverse the trend and build an even stronger Sleep Cycle. This marks a new chapter for us, and although sales cycles in B2B are longer than in the consumer business, we are confident that our technology meets a real need. We are building for long-term impact — and for a future where our technology becomes an integral part of the digital health ecosystem. The market is changing — and we are changing with it. We are not only building for better sleep, but for a greater role in digital health, public health, research, and data analysis. Thank you for your continued support and belief in our vision!

Revenue for the first half increased by 33% to DKK 2,998 million, reflecting a strong performance in both Travel Health and Public Preparedness. Travel Health revenue increased by 24% to DKK 1,386 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by increased demand for rabies and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccines. Public Preparedness revenue increased by 51% to DKK 1,546 million compared to the first half of 2024, primarily driven by quarterly phasing of orders. Other revenue was DKK 66 million. EBITDA was DKK 961 million, corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 32%. Based on a strong performance in the Travel Health business as well as further clarity on the Public Preparedness business for the remainder of the year, Bavarian Nordic has refined its financial guidance for 2025, which overall remains within the previously announced revenue and EBITDA margin intervals. Full year revenue expectations are narrowed to DKK 6,000-6,600 million, reflecting an upgrade of Travel Health to DKK 2,750 million, which still includes DKK 50-100 million from sale of Vimkunya, and narrowing the Public Preparedness interval to DKK 3,100-3,700 million, with the low end of the interval now secured by contracts. EBITDA margin before special items guidance remains unchanged at 26-30%. When including the net income of DKK 810 million from the recent sale of the Priority Review Voucher, the total EBITDA margin is expected to be 40-42%. DKK million Q2 2025 Q2 2024 H1 2025 H1 2024 2025 Guidance Revenue 1,652 1,427 2,998 2,259 6,000 – 6,600 EBITDA margin before special items 1 33% 29% 32% 20% 26-30% 1 Other operating income of DKK 810 million from the sale of the Priority Review Voucher will be recognized in Q3 2025, contributing to an expected total EBITDA margin of 40-42% for the full year. Paul Chaplin, President & Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic said: “We are pleased to report a strong first half of 2025, which fully captures our successful commercial transformation over the past years, in line with our growth strategy. Our Travel Health business continues to outperform, delivering 24% revenue growth year-over-year, primarily driven by rabies and TBE vaccines. A major highlight for the period was the launch of our chikungunya vaccine for travelers, which is being introduced in more countries as we continue to expand our commercial footprint across new geographies. With the strong performance combined with recent additional orders for our mpox/smallpox vaccine, we refine our full year guidance to reflect higher revenue from Travel Health and a narrower revenue interval for the Public Preparedness business as we have now secured the lower end of our guidance for this business. Overall, we remain within our guided revenue interval and maintain our expectations to an EBITDA margin before special items of 26-30% in 2025. The recent sale of our Priority Review Voucher has generated a one-off income, strengthening our financial position and contributing to an improved result. Hence, the EBITDA margin including special items is expected to be 40-42% for the full year.” Highlights from the period Travel Health Vimkunya was approved in the US, EU and in the UK for active immunization for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus in individuals 12 years and older. The vaccine was launched commercially in the US in March, in Germany in May, and in France in June. Concurrently with the US approval of Vimkunya, Bavarian Nordic was granted a Priority Review Voucher, which was sold for USD 160 million. Upon completion of the sale in July, the Company earned net proceeds of DKK 810 million. Following the approval of Vimkunya in the US in February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend Vimkunya for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus for US persons aged 12 and older traveling to regions with an outbreak or elevated risk of chikungunya, as well as for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to chikungunya virus. Recommendations on the use of the vaccine have since been issued by relevant authorities in France, Germany and in the UK. In June, a Phase 3 clinical trial of Vimkunya in children 2 to 11 years of age was initiated, seeking to expand the target population for the chikungunya vaccine. Public Preparedness The freeze-dried version of JYNNEOS was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March for prevention of smallpox and mpox disease in adults 18 years of age and older. The approval supports the ongoing contract with the US government for stockpiling of the vaccine. In May, the US government exercised additional options valued at USD 143.6 million under the contract, with the majority planned for delivery in 2026. In June, investigator-sponsored clinical trials were initiated to support approval of the mpox/smallpox vaccine in vulnerable populations: infants under 2 years of age and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Events after the reporting date In July, Bavarian Nordic entered a contract valued at over DKK 200 million for the supply of smallpox/mpox vaccines to a European country. Combined with other recent orders from non-European countries, the Company has now secured approximately DKK 3,100 million in contracts in the Public Preparedness business in 2025, thus within the targeted guidance interval for this business. In July, Health Canada accepted for review the Company’s application for licensure of the chikungunya vaccine, potentially supporting approval in the first half of 2026. In July, the sale of the Priority Review Voucher was completed, generating net proceeds of DKK 810 million. In July, Bavarian Nordic announced that it had entered into an announcement agreement with Innosera ApS, a newly formed company controlled by Nordic Capital Fund XI1 and funds managed and advised by Permira Beteiligungsberatung GmbH, pursuant to which Innosera ApS will make an all-cash recommended voluntary public takeover offer to acquire all issued and outstanding shares (excluding treasury shares) in Bavarian Nordic. Innosera ApS is expected to publish its offer document on August 26, 2025, at the latest.

Second Quarter Highlights Record sales revenue of SEK 9,4M, a 67% year-over-year increase compared with the second quarter 2024 Minimal short-term impact from U.S.–EU tariffs US-FDA review underway for expanded labeling of ClearPoint Prism® to include 1.5T MRI compatibility, doubling the TAM in U.S Strong team and partner performance, continued market expansion, and a structurally lower cost base Board of directors strenghted with expertice in the neuro market and supply chain management to support continued growth Financial position remains on track ahead of TO8B warrant exercise in September Summary of the interim report (relates to the Group) First six months (01/01/2025–06/30/2025) Net sales totaled SEK 13,858,000 (SEK 8,762,000). Operating profit totaled SEK -10,775,000 (SEK -29,865,000). Profit/loss after financial items totaled SEK - 21,578,000 (SEK -26,163,000). Basic and diluted earnings per share totaled SEK -0,92 (SEK -3,46). The equity ratio on June 30, 2025, was 90% (63%). The second quarter (04/01/2025–06/30/2025) Net sales totaled SEK 9,362,000 (SEK 5,622,000). Operating profit totaled SEK -2,907,000 (SEK -12,873,000). Profit/loss after financial items totaled SEK -6,348,000 (SEK -13,592,000). Basic and diluted earnings per share totaled SEK -0,28 (SEK -1,87). The equity ratio on June 30, 2025, was 90% (63%). Significant events in the second quarter of 2025 CLS announced the submission of its 510(k) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for expanding the indication of ClearPoint Prism to also include 1.5 T MRI guidance. At the Annual General Meeting, held 27 June 2025, the meeting resolved to re-elect Peter Max as a member of the Board of Directors and to elect Lena Höglund, Veronica Byfield, Thomas Binzer and Jerker Nygren. Peter Max was re-elected as Chairman of the Board. Significant events after the end of the period There were no significant events following the end of the quarter. Comments from CEO Dan J. Mogren The second quarter of 2025 reflects continued strong execution of our strategic and operational priorities and with sales in the quarter at record levels. Continued Revenue Growth & Cost Discipline Revenue grew by 67% compared to Q2 last year, driven by a particularly strong performance in our neurosurgery segment and exceptionally high sales volumes to our partner Clearpoint Neuro. This growth, combined with continued cost discipline, resulted in a gross margin of 70%, well above our full-year target of 60%, and a reduction in operating expenses of more than 30% versus the second quarter of 2024. For the first six months, Revenue growth was 58%, Gross Margin 69% and OPEX reduced more than 30% vs. 2024. U.S.-EU Trade Deal The recently announced U.S.–EU trade deal establishes a general 15% tariff ceiling on most EU goods, but the treatment of medical devices remains uncertain. While discussions continue and the impact on our business is minimal today, we continue to monitor the development. 510(k) Submission under review by US-FDA In late April, CLS submitted its 510(k) application to U.S. FDA to expand the labeling of the ClearPoint Prism® Neuro Laser Therapy System to include image guidance also with 1.5T MRI scanners. The application is currently under FDA review. Upon clearance, this label expansion would significantly broaden patient access to MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (NeuroLITT), allowing for accelerating adoption and growth even further. Strengthening of the Board of Directors In the second quarter, CLS also strengthened its governance with the election of four new members to the Board of Directors, as approved by our shareholders at the AGM on June 27. I am pleased that Peter Max continues in his role as Chairman, providing continuity as we welcome new perspectives and expertise within areas important to CLS, such as the neuro market and supply chain management, to support the company’s next phase of growth. Outlook Remains Strong Our long-term growth outlook remains strong, supported by solid partner relationships, continued market expansion in neurosurgery, and a robust pipeline of opportunities. With revenue growth and margins both exceeding targets, and our cost base structurally lower, we are confident in our ability to sustain high double-digit growth for 2025. Our financial position remains on plan, positioning CLS well ahead of the planned TO8B warrant exercise in September and enabling us to continue creating value for shareholders while advancing the commercial rollout of our technology with our strategic upstream and downstream partners. CLS Vision In a rapidly evolving global environment, it is essential for CLS to combine strong operational execution with a clear long-term vision. Our commitment is to ensure that shareholders, partners, and clinicians remain aligned with the transformative journey we are pursuing. Surgery is entering a new era. Advances in imaging, artificial intelligence, and minimally invasive techniques are converging with the growing medical need created by an increasing incidence of disorders worldwide that require surgery. Together, these factors are accelerating the adoption of image-guided minimally invasive surgery — not only to enhance surgical precision, but also to shorten recovery times, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes. CLS’s vision is to be at the forefront of this transformation. Through our synergistic partnership with Clearpoint Neuro, we are uniquely positioned to lead the global adoption of MR image-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (NeuroLITT) within neurosurgery. By combining CLS’s precision laser ablation technology with Clearpoint Neuro’s advanced neuro-navigation systems, we enable clinicians to safely and effectively treat patients with conditions that have previously been difficult to manage. This sets the stage for a new standard of care in neurosurgery. Looking ahead, we remain committed to building a sustainable business model with recurring revenues, expanding access to our technology, and creating long-term value for patients, healthcare providers, and shareholders alike. Shareholder Value The commitment of our shareholders is instrumental in our progress and in driving our mission to revolutionize the surgical treatment with image-guided precision laser technology. We believe our journey forward will not only advance surgical treatment but also create significant value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to your active participation in the exciting developments to come. Dan J.

Net sales were DKK 73.7 million as compared to DKK 82.3 million in the 1st half of 2024 due to reduction in properties. The increase in EBVAT was primarily driven by decrease in operating expenses due to decrease in properties and control over expenses (DKK 3.7 million) in overhead expenses (employee benefit and other external expenses) by DKK 5.8 million and reduction in financial expenses by (DKK 6.1 million). Group’s equity as of 30 June 2025 was positive at DKK 980 million. The Board of Directors of Park Street A/S discussed and today approved the company's Interim report 2025, which contained the following: The period in outline Park Street's Profit for the Period (after tax and valuation adjustments) is DKK 17.7 million for the 1st half of 2025 (1st half of 2024: DKK 2.9 million. Park Street achieved EBVAT in the first half of 2025 is DKK 13.7 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 6.5 million). Net sales were DKK 73.7 million as compared to DKK 82.3 million in the 1st half of 2024 due to reduction in properties. The increase in EBVAT was primarily driven by decrease in operating expenses due to decrease in properties and control over expenses (DKK 3.7 million) in overhead expenses (employee benefit and other external expenses) by DKK 5.8 million and reduction in financial expenses by (DKK 6.1 million). Group’s equity as of 30 June 2025 was positive at DKK 980 million. Cash flows from operating activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 2.7 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 20.3 million). The decrease is due to change in operating capital (DKK -11.1 million as compared to DKK 13.4 million in the same period last year) offset by lower financial expenses paid (DKK 31.0 million as compared to DKK 37.2 million in the same period last year). Cash flows from investing activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 22.1 million (1st half of 2024: DKK 74.3 million). The decrease is due to sale of investment property (DKK 28 million) in H1 2025 as compared last year of DKK 282 million, offset of DKK 5.9 million spent on improvements to investment properties across the portfolio and purchase of treasury share of DKK 134.9 million in the 1st half of 2024. Cash flows from financing activities for the 1st half of 2025 were DKK 30.1 million (1st half of 2024: -DKK 101.5 million). The decrease in cash flows driven by repayment of liabilities to credit institutions by DKK 30.1 million (1st half of 2024: -DKK 101.5 million). Expectations for 2025 Park Street’s EBVAT expectations have been revised in view of expected repayment of current loan from new mortgage financing. The Company now expects EBVAT in the range of DKK 20 million to DKK 25 million, compared to the earlier guidance of DKK 30 million to DKK 40 million. In addition, the refinancing will result in a one-time, non-cash capitalised borrowing cost of approximately DKK 22 million, which will be recognised in 2025 and further impact reported EBVAT for the year. Management comments on the interim report In connection with the interim report for H1 2025, CEO Pradeep Pattem states the following: “Park Street delivered a strong operating performance in the first half of 2025 with EBVAT of DKK 13.7 million, more than double compared to the same period last year. This was achieved despite lower rental income from asset sales, reflecting disciplined control of costs and reduced financial expenses. We continued our strategic transition with the sale of Stagehøjvej 22, Silkeborg and thereby further reducing exposure to non-core assets. The capital structure has been simplified with the cancellation of 13.8 million treasury shares approved at the AGM. As at the date of this report, Park Street has received a credit-approved term sheet from a mortgage institution for refinancing of the current loan. The company expects to repay the loan at its scheduled maturity through this new financing. While this will result in a one-time non-cash borrowing cost of approximately DKK 22 million, it will strengthen our long-term funding base and reduce future interest costs. Our Pulse strategy remains central to Park Street’s future. Pulse Norrebro continues at full occupancy with a vibrant international community. We will continue to prioritize technology-driven, design-led property management to enhance tenant experience and sustainability outcomes. For 2025, we now expect EBVAT in the range of DKK 20–25 million compared to earlier guidance of DKK 30–40 million, reflecting refinancing effects and timing of disposals. Park Street remains focused on consolidating around core assets including Pulse platform, reducing exposure to retail and regional assets.” Attached files Interim report 2025 is attached to this announcement.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits, including its Construction and Operations Plan, following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously in dialogue with permitting agencies and potentially through legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed as quickly as possible with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026. The construction of Revolution Wind is 80 % complete, and the investment required to complete the project amounts to approximately DKK 5 billion for Ørsted’s 50% share of the project. Once complete, Revolution Wind is expected to have an annual run-rate EBITDA contribution of approximately DKK 1 billion. Planned rights issue preparation moves forward according to plan Ørsted will proceed with the planned rights issue preparation and has the continued support and commitment to the rights issue from its majority shareholder, the Danish state. The DKK 60 billion planned rights issue announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement no. 12/2025) is designed to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide the needed financial flexibility and robustness in addition to funding the increased CAPEX requirement to complete Sunrise Wind, absent a partial divestment and non-recourse financing of the project. The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasises the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the US. The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Ørsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Ørsted’s US offshore wind portfolio. Ørsted confirms the timing of the extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 5 September 2025 and will, in due course, revert with further details regarding the launch of the rights issue. Ørsted appoints bank syndicate for rights issue Ørsted has appointed a syndicate of BNP PARIBAS, Danske Bank A/S and J.P. Morgan SE as Joint Global Coordinators next to Morgan Stanley & Co International. Additionally, BofA Securities Europe SA and Goldman Sachs International will act as Joint Bookrunners. The syndicate of banks are jointly underwriting the rights issue for the approximately 49.9 % not covered by the Danish state’s undertaking. Rasmus Errboe, Group President and CEO of Ørsted, said: “Revolution Wind is fully permitted and 80 % complete with all foundations installed and 45 of the 65 wind turbines installed. We’re complying with the order and will work with our US partners and stakeholders to identify a solution as quickly as possible for completing the project and thereby help meet the rapidly growing US demand for power and provide much needed power to over 350,000 homes in the area."" “We appreciate the continued support from our majority shareholder and are pleased with the appointment of a strong consortium of banks as a natural next step towards the launch of our planned rights issue.” Financial update The stop-work order for Revolution Wind does not change Ørsted's financial guidance for 2025. Based on Ørsted’s objective to complete Revolution Wind by the second half 2026, Ørsted confirms its medium-term targets. Ørsted’s 8.1 GW offshore wind projects under construction will, when finalised by the end of 2027, generate an additional DKK 11-12 billion of annual EBITDA. The two US offshore wind projects under construction will account for around DKK 4.5 billion in run-rate EBITDA (50% Revolution Wind and 100% Sunrise Wind ownership). The total investment in the two projects, on a 100 % basis, is expected to be approximately DKK 100 billion. The remaining share of Ørsted investments into the projects is approximately DKK 45 billion. As of 30 June 2025, the carrying value of Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind on Ørsted’s balance sheet amount to approximately DKK 17 billion.

Revolution Wind is fully permitted, having secured all required federal and state permits, including its Construction and Operations Plan, following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Ørsted is evaluating all options to resolve the matter expeditiously in dialogue with permitting agencies and potentially through legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed as quickly as possible with continued project construction towards COD in the second half of 2026. The construction of Revolution Wind is 80 % complete, and the investment required to complete the project amounts to approximately DKK 5 billion for Ørsted’s 50% share of the project. Once complete, Revolution Wind is expected to have an annual run-rate EBITDA contribution of approximately DKK 1 billion. Planned rights issue preparation moves forward according to plan Ørsted will proceed with the planned rights issue preparation and has the continued support and commitment to the rights issue from its majority shareholder, the Danish state. The DKK 60 billion planned rights issue announced on 11 August 2025 (company announcement no. 12/2025) is designed to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide the needed financial flexibility and robustness in addition to funding the increased CAPEX requirement to complete Sunrise Wind, absent a partial divestment and non-recourse financing of the project. The stop-work order for Revolution Wind emphasises the increased regulatory uncertainty for offshore wind in the US. The planned rights issue has been sized to provide the required strengthening of Ørsted’s capital structure to execute its business plan, even when taking into account the impact of this uncertainty on Ørsted’s US offshore wind portfolio. Ørsted confirms the timing of the extraordinary general meeting scheduled for 5 September 2025 and will, in due course, revert with further details regarding the launch of the rights issue. Ørsted appoints bank syndicate for rights issue Ørsted has appointed a syndicate of BNP PARIBAS, Danske Bank A/S and J.P.

Good July weather in Finland closed part of the Q2 shortfall Very strong performance in Italy, France and the International segment Market share gains across most categories and geographies reflecting strong commercial execution 18% EPS growth, driven by stronger profitability Cash flow for H1 2025 was in line with our plans, and a new share buy-back program of DKK 300m is launched Financial outlook ranges narrowed – we now expect 5-6% net revenue growth (previously 5-7%) and 8-12% EBIT growth (previously 7-13%) for full year 2025 CEO Lars Jensen comments : ""With 11% EBIT growth, we delivered a solid first-half performance in line with our plans, supported by strong execution across most markets. While colder weather in Finland impacted volumes in Q2, this was offset by strong performance in the Western Europe and International segment. These results reflect the increasing geographical diversity of Royal Unibrew and reaffirm the strength of our multi-beverage model. We continue to focus on our growth framework, prioritizing the development of key brands while gradually reducing private label and other lower-margin businesses. With our strategic initiatives progressing well, we remain confident to deliver within our updated full-year guidance ranges and drive long-term shareholder value.” Selected Financial Highlights and Ratios mDKK Q2 2025 Q2 2024 % change H1 2025 H1 2024 % change FY 2024 Volume (mHL ) 5.1 4.8 7 8.8 8.4 4 17.4 Organic volume growth (%) 7 1 4 3 5 Net revenue 4,438 4,180 6 7,644 7,379 4 15,036 Organic net revenue growth (%) 5 4 3 6 6 EBITDA 917 821 12 1,308 1,197 9 2,634 EBITDA margin (%) 20.7 19.6 17.1 16.2 17.5 EBIT 740 656 13 959 866 11 1,968 Organic EBIT growth (%) 11 17 9 16 15 EBIT margin (%) 16.7 15.7 12.5 11.7 13.1 Free cash flow 1,001 1,041 -4 458 560 -18 1,434 ROIC incl. goodwill (%)* 12 12 12 Earnings per share 10.6 9.2 15 13.2 11.2 18 29.2 * Trailing 12 months. Solid H1 2025 Performance The Group delivered a solid performance in the first half of 2025, maintaining momentum in Q2. Volumes increased organically by 4% to 8.8m hectoliters in H1 2025, driven by growth in the Western Europe and International segments. Northern Europe saw a slight decline, primarily due to cold weather in Finland during Q2. However, good July weather in Finland closed part of volume shortfall caused by the weather in Q2. Operating in a consumer environment that remains challenging, but broadly unchanged from 2024, Royal Unibrew is estimated to have gained market share across most markets. Net revenue reached DKK 7,644m, up 3% organically from H1 2024, with no material changes in price/mix. Organic growth was primarily driven by our new activities in Belgium and Luxemburg (BeLux), following the start of the PepsiCo partnership on October 1, 2024. BeLux contributed approximately 3.5% to the Group’s volume growth and 2.5% to net revenue growth in H1 and Q2 2025. EBIT grew organically by 9% to DKK 959m, with the EBIT margin expanding by 80 basis points to 12.5%, reflecting our ongoing efficiency initiatives. The positive margin development was achieved despite increased investments in marketing activities during the period. In the first half of 2025 Royal Unibrew continued to make progress on the ESG agenda, delivering tangible results across key focus areas, with reduced Co2 intensity in production and improved safety performance as notable achievements. Q2 2025 Highlights Organic volume growth accelerated to 7%, reaching 5.1m hectoliters. The higher growth rate in Q2 was primarily driven by the timing of Easter, which fell in Q2 in 2025 and shifted some sales from Q1. Additionally, a strike in Finland contributed to this shift, further moving sales from Q1 to Q2. Underlying market trends remained largely unchanged between the quarters . Net revenue rose organically by 5% to DKK 4,438m in the quarter. Approximately 2.5% of the growth was attributable to the new BeLux activities. EBIT increased organically by 11% to DKK 740m in Q2 2025, with a margin expansion of 100 basis points to 16.7%. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet Free cash flow for the first half of 2025 amounted to DKK 458m, compared to DKK 560m in H1 2024. The development was in line with our plans, supported by higher net profit for the period, but offset by higher capex. Net working capital was reduced by DKK 81m compared to the same time last year, and we expect a positive impact on cash flow from net working capital for the full year. Net interest-bearing debt (NIBD) stood at DKK 6,374m at the end of H1 2025, up from DKK 5,848m at the end of H1 2024. The increase was mainly attributable to the dividend payment in Q2 2025, whereas in 2024, the dividend was postponed to the fourth quarter. Furthermore, NIBD was impacted by higher capex and the ongoing share buy-back program. The 12-month NIBD/EBITDA ratio was 2.3 at the end of H1 2025 in line with our target level. Share buy-back Program A separate announcement about the launch of a new share buy-back program of up to DKK 300m is issued today. The program will be concluded no later than December 19, 2025. Updated Financial Outlook for full-year 2025 Based on our performance in the first half of 2025 and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are narrowing the ranges the full-year financial outlook as follows Net revenue growth is now expected in the range of 5-6% (previously 5-7%) EBIT growth is expected in the range of 8-12% (was 7-13%) These adjustments reflect broadly normal summer weather conditions across our markets, resulting in no additional impact on activity levels. Additionally, revenue has been affected by a reduction in private label production and adverse foreign exchange developments. The consumer environment remains challenging but stable compared to 2024, and our assumptions in this area remain unchanged. Other assumptions for guidance are unchanged: Net financial expenses, excluding currency related losses or gains, of around DKK 250m (2024: DKK 301m) Effective tax rate of around 22% (2024: 21.5%) Capex in the range around 7% revenue (2024: 6%) Conference Call Investors and analysts can register for a conference call on August 27, 2025, at 09:00 am CEST at the following links: Webcast: Telephone: For Further Information on This Announcement: Media and Investor Relations: Flemming Ole Nielsen, +45 25 41 68 04, Forward-looking statements This interim report contains forward-looking statements, including statements about the Group’s sales, revenue, earnings, spending, margins, cash flows, inventories, products, actions, plans, strategies, objectives and guidance with respect to the Group’s future operating results.

Gentoo Media today announces its interim results for the second quarter of 2025. The quarter marked the completion of the strategic realignment initiated in Q1, streamlining and stabilising the business and sharpening the operational focus. As a result, Gentoo Media enters the second half of the year aligned for long-term value creation. Q2 2025 Financial Highlights ● Revenue: EUR 24.4 million (EUR 30.2 million), down 19% YoY, flat QoQ ● EBITDA before special items: EUR 7.5 million (EUR 14.8 million), margin 31% (49%). ● Cash flow from operations: EUR 7.7 million (EUR 6.2 million) Q2 performance reflects deliberate operational recalibration, market softness in Brazil, and seasonal impact from the absence of major sports events. Importantly, material cost reductions were executed as planned, with EBITDA margins returning above 40% in June. Marketing investments during the quarter drove a 43% increase in player intake QoQ and elevated deposit values to EUR 195 million. Despite these positive developments in underlying business drivers, revenue has developed below expectations. Updated Full-Year 2025 Guidance Management has refined its full-year outlook to reflect the current pace of improvement and strategic realignment: ● Revenue: EUR 100–105 million ● EBITDA before special items: EUR 40–43 million ● EBITDA Margin: 40%–41% ● Free cash flow from operations: EUR 27–30 million Cash flow from investment activities EUR -38 million. Investment outflows primarily reflect M&A and demerger costs initiated in 2024, with EUR 34.3 million already paid by the end of July 2025. These are now largely concluded. Looking ahead Gentoo Media enters the second half of 2025 as a leaner, sharper, and more agile business. The foundation laid in Q2 is already translating into stronger underlying performance. Growth in player intake, improved marketing efficiency, and positive post-quarter signals from the Brazilian market all reinforce the outlook for H2. Optimisation across our Publishing and Paid Media portfolios - including a positive Google Core update and recalibrated acquisition model - further strengthen our position for the second half of the year.

The report is available on Bawat’s website (investor.bawat.com) BAWAT is a leading supplier of sustainable ballast water treatment technology and services. BAWAT was listed on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market in Stockholm in March 2022. Bawat in positive EBITDA figures from June onwards. Backlog volume supports positive EBITDA for second half year of 2025. BaaS (Ballast-as-a-Service) is driving profitability. Gross Profit % was 43,0 %, compared with 13,2% in H1 2024 and higher than earlier guidance. EBITDA for H1 was SEK - 9,9m. For the month of June, EBITDA was positive. EBITDA is expected to be positive for H2 2025. A major step for Bawat. EBITDA and Gross Profit is driven by a significant increase in Baas (Ballast-as-a-Service) delivered in Holland, Belgium, Germany, Spain and Denmark for a variety of clients and project types. The positive development in business activities came later than expected as Bawat only started executing on the backlog BaaS volume signed already in late 2024 with a ship recycling client due to external factors. Additional new BaaS capacity will deliver in Q3 supporting growth. With the Hong Kong convention on ship re-cycling coming into force in late June, ballast water on ships for re-cycling has become a hazardous material that needs disposal, and thus Bawat is expecting a further uptake from this business segment in H2 2025 and onwards. Post closing, Bawat has in addition to other orders received a large BaaS contract in Germany for execution in September signed for delivery of D2 compliant ballast water. This delivery to vessels is to Bawat knowledge a first of its kind and only possible due to the unique one-pass technology Bawat BaaS is based upon. Bawat has had initial dialogue regarding supply of water on land for various purposes treated by Bawat for invasive species. This market could potentially be significant utilizing Bawats existing technology unchanged. Bawat is post closure in dialogue with our lenders to prolong the repayment profile of the long-term debt. A Concentrated Inspection Campaign (CIC) will be conducted across the world by port state controls starting September 2025. Expectations are that it will gradually increase awareness of non-functional BWMS and the need to use Port Reception Facilities including Bawats BaaS’ solution. FINANCIAL KEY FIGURES H1 2025 SEK '1.000 H1 2025 H1 2024 12M 2024 Sales 8.328 8.786 14.584 Gross Profit 3.581 1.155 2.324 Gross Profit % 43,0% 13,2% 15,9% EBITDA -9.913 -12.381 -23.595 Result for the period -14.863 -21.562 -41.314 Earnings per share -0,17 -0,39 -0,66 Cash flow from operations* -14.049 -11.871 -25.275 Net working capital -13 -3.978 -1.772 Equity ratio % -52,1% -47,9% -41,3% *In addition to this, Capital raise and other related non-recurrent items SEK 1.6m in H1 ’24 (SEK 0.4m in H1 ’24 & 3.1 in FY 2024) Marcus P. Hummer, CEO. “2025 is a pivotal year for Bawat. We are now moving into black EBITDA figures for the second half of the year and our BaaS activity is driving this. We are however also experiencing an increase in demand for both our mobile systems and ship board systems as customers with non-compliant ballast water acknowledge the value of having a BWMS that works in all conditions”. “We have a unique product offering to support the spread of invasive species in the marine environment. Port State Control and local environmental authorities have all options open to enforce the legislation. We expect the Concentrated Inspection Campaign starting September across the world will highlight the massive need for Port Reception Facilities in order for ballast water discharge to stay compliant – in ports, at yards and at sea”. Guidance 2025 The Company has gradually changed its emphasis to more focus on sales of our mobile solutions and in particular BaaS solutions but still offering our unique pasteurization solutions to vessels. So in essence Bawat has three legs to stand on based on same unique and patented technology, pasteurization. Following the final adoption of the ballast water convention on 8th September 2024 Bawat has seen a gradual ramp-up in activities, especially on BaaS. This also means the existing guiding principles being sales forecast are no longer ideal to measure performance as the new activities contribute with a far higher margin than pure sale of systems. Bawat has previously changed guiding principles from sales to EBITDA. On a comparable sales volume to H1 2024, the GP margin has increased from 13% to 43% which is higher than previously guided. July 2025 was the second consecutive month with a positive EBITDA. Consequently, Bawat is guiding for positive EBITDA for H2 2025 based on combination of current BaaS track record and backlog. The full year EBITDA for 2025 is expected to be in the range of SEK -9 to -6m, below earlier guidance indicating a positive EBITDA for the year. At the time of our listing in March 2022 our prospectus guided our investors towards EBITDA-breakeven Q4 2024. The company is two quarters late relative to our original guidance. However, business potential is broader and with significantly higher profitability than originally forecasted.

Published: 2025-08-28 16:30:13 CEST LR Health & Beauty SE - Inside information LR Health & Beauty SE: Potential breach of Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 - Management Board intends to enter into discussions with bondholders of the 2024/2028 bond ... Disclosure of an inside information acc. to Art. 17 of the Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation – MAR) LR Health & Beauty SE: Potential breach of Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 – Management Board intends to enter into discussions with bondholders of the 2024/2028 bond regarding a precautionary resolution on a waiver of compliance with the Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025 and an amendment to the bond terms; adjustment of EBITDA guidance for the financial year 2025. Ahlen, 28 August 2025 – The Management Board of LR Health & Beauty SE (“LR” or the “Company”) resolved today to initiate precautionary negotiations with the holders of the 2024/2028 bond (ISIN: NO0013149658) concerning a proposal to amend the bond terms. The background to this decision is a potential breach by the Company of the covenant under Clause 13.2 of the bond terms, pursuant to which the Company must ensure that net debt in relation to EBITDA does not exceed the threshold of 4.50:1 as at 30 September 2025 (“Leverage Covenant”). Clause 13.2.1 (iii) of the bond terms provides that the Leverage Covenant decreases from 4.75:1 to 4.50:1 with effect from 1 July 2025. Based on the valuation and calculation information currently available, though still preliminary in nature, the Management Board assumes that compliance with the Leverage Covenant on the review date of 30 September 2025 is unlikely. This is due to EBITDA developing less favourably than expected, primarily attributable to increased or increasing costs in the areas of marketing and sales. The Management Board has therefore resolved to enter into precautionary negotiations with the bondholders regarding an amendment to the bond terms – in particular the Leverage Covenant – and, if necessary, to request their consent to a waiver of the Leverage Covenant as at 30 September 2025. Furthermore, the Management Board will in due course provide information on the further course of action concerning the nature and timing of any vote on an amendment to the bond terms. Furthermore, the Management Board of the Company is adjusting the guidance for the financial year 2025 published on 25 April 2025. With regard to sales (revenue from goods sold), the Management Board now expects a stable development compared with the previous year. Previously, stable to moderately increasing sales had been forecast. EBITDA for the 2025 financial year is now expected to range between EUR 24.0 million and EUR 27.0 million – whereas the previous guidance anticipated significant EBITDA growth compared with the prior-year figure of EUR 27.3 million. The revision of the guidance is essentially due to increased or increasing costs in the areas of marketing and sales. This trend also continued in July, leading the Management Board to conclude that the previous guidance is unlikely to be achieved through catch-up effects or cost-saving measures.

The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact persons set out above, at 7.45 am CET on August 28, 2025. CEO’s Review Q2 saw a solid quarter of delivery in line with expectations, finishing off the quarter with three launches to add to four in Q1 2025, taking the total launched in 2025 so far to seven launches, with a solid pipeline of launches to come during Q3 2025 and beyond. I am particularly excited to see the launch of our first operator in the Philippines, which is fast becoming a key focal market for us. There is significant potential to be realised from the opportunities within this region, and I anticipate both our partner and the market in general to deliver significant revenue upside in the near to mid-term. Indeed, we see increasing potential not just in the APAC region but in the broader emerging markets, including LatAm, Eastern Europe and Africa, where iGaming regulation is evolving and creating substantial expansion opportunities for GiG. In these markets we intend to enter into larger, more strategic agreements with our partners, delivering a higher return on investment. This strategy also aligns with increased investor interest from emerging markets as demonstrated by the €4.7 million directed equity issue completed in June, which has strengthened our balance sheet and will allow us to act swiftly on strategic investments and business opportunities in line with our growth strategy whilst adding new investors to our shareholder base. Following the end of the quarter, we announced that an additional subscription undertaking had been received for a total consideration of approximately €22 million. This will allow us to capitalise even further upon new market opportunities whilst adding additional support to our balance sheet enabling us to accelerate plans to execute on our business strategy. I am delighted that following the end of the quarter, we have entered into a Heads of Terms to migrate a European Lottery’s online casino vertical onto GiG’s iGaming platform in H1-26. This is a significant milestone as not only does it represent the first Lottery win for the business, but it will also open up additional opportunities in this sector in the future and demonstrates further evidence that our technology is suited to both Tier 1 partners and market leaders in their respective regions. Whilst I am pleased that we have launched seven partners during the first half of this year, this is not where we would have aspired to have been at this point of the year, reflecting current market dynamics. Our focus has been very much on ensuring quality delivery and partnering with the right customers; however, this has meant that the launch cadence has not been realised at the speed that we had anticipated. To expand upon this further, the market sentiment and regulatory developments surrounding Sweepstakes in the US has had a negative impact, meaning that some partners have adopted more caution in entering this market. This, coupled with regulatory and market readiness delays for some of our partners, has contributed to the postponement of certain launches during the period. Once again, our cost control focus has delivered a sharp increase in both adjusted EBITDA and EBIT of €2.1 million and €2.9 million respectively, with GiG’s adjusted EBITDA achieving €1.0 million for the quarter. This is a testament to the scalability of our business model, and we are beginning to realise the potential for margin generation within our operations. Q2 saw another quarter of pipeline conversions, with three new commercial agreements signed alongside four new managed services agreements once again showcasing GiG’s ability to win new contracts amongst a backdrop of delivering a market-leading product to our existing partners. We are maintaining investment in both our product and sales execution to ensure that both our product and pipeline remain robust, and we continue to supply our partners with the very best in iGaming services and technology whilst attracting new, quality customers to our platform. The additional capital made available through the shareholder undertakings will support these initiatives and provide us with additional fuel for growth. In the light of all these developments, we have reassessed our guidance for 2025 accordingly, and have also provided guidance for 2026 revenue and EBITDA. With our focus on key new markets that are delivering significant mid-term growth, alongside our strengthened balance sheet and corresponding ability to strategically target high quality, experienced partners, I am happy that we can now share our growth targets for the mid-term, as set out in our aforementioned guidance. Overall, I am pleased with our progress in H1 2025 and am excited about what the future holds. Our strengthened financial position will enable us to make necessary investments in product development and new market opportunities which will position GiG for sustainable, long-term profitable growth; the future has never been brighter.

Improved cash flow and solid performance in Europe First quarter summary Despite a slight decline in orders during the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remains above 1, reflecting a healthy business environment. Net sales at constant exchange rates grew by 3 percent, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe, where our latest linear accelerator, Elekta Evo, and our new software suite, Elekta ONE, are gaining traction as online adaptive treatment capabilities continue to set new benchmarks in the market. The adjusted gross margin in Q1 was impacted by normal seasonality and continued negative FX effects, resulting in a year-over-year decrease to 37.0 percent (37.8). In addition, this quarter had a negative impact from tariffs of SEK 33 M, which weighed on the margin performance by 90 bps. The negative impact was partly offset by price improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin for the first quarter came in at 6.5 percent, compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher amortization and lower capitalization, although this was partly offset by reduced selling and administrative expenses, reflecting the effect from our continued cost-saving initiatives. Operating cash flow after continuous investments improved by SEK 529 million, reaching SEK -361 million in the first quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by improved working capital management. Investor update On June 10, we held an Investor Update with the purpose of providing an update of our progress across several key projects as well as presenting the strong fundamentals of the radiation therapy industry. We reiterated the roadmap to achieve our mid-term financial objectives. This includes restoring the gross margin to pre-pandemic levels and reaching an EBIT margin of at least 14 percent. Key drivers are growing volumes, enhanced pricing supported by new product launches, an improved product mix, and accelerated expansion in mature markets. As part of our commitment to operational excellence, we also presented the result of a proactive order review aimed at increasing the quality of the backlog to improve profitability and predictability. Commercial milestones During the quarter, we delivered several important commercial wins with Elekta Evo and our software suite Elekta ONE. For example, we concluded a comprehensive deal including some of our most advanced solutions to the University of Texas Southwestern. Leksell Gamma Knife received FDA 510(k) clearance for treating a certain type of epilepsy, which is an important step towards expanding the scope of radiosurgery. We have also noted that the ERECT trial, demonstrating Elekta Unity’s capability to treat prostate cancer while preserving erectile function, has gained significant attention. Outlook We expect net sales for Q2 to be negatively impacted by a continued weak US development as well as a negative effect from last year's low order intake in China. However, we expect sales in China to start to recover during the second half of 2025/26. Furthermore, we expect a continuous negative impact on earnings from FX at current exchange rates and from tariffs in Q2. We reiterate our full year 2025/26 outlook, where we expect net sales in constant currency to grow year-over-year. I would like to end my CEO comment by welcoming Jakob Just-Bomholt as Elekta’s new CEO. Jakob is a highly experienced international executive with a successful career and CEO positions in various global industries, including the medtech sector. Jakob will assume his new role as CEO on September 1.

Improved cash flow and solid performance in Europe First quarter summary Despite a slight decline in orders during the first quarter, our book-to-bill ratio remains above 1, reflecting a healthy business environment. Net sales at constant exchange rates grew by 3 percent, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe, where our latest linear accelerator, Elekta Evo, and our new software suite, Elekta ONE, are gaining traction as online adaptive treatment capabilities continue to set new benchmarks in the market. The adjusted gross margin in Q1 was impacted by normal seasonality and continued negative FX effects, resulting in a year-over-year decrease to 37.0 percent (37.8). In addition, this quarter had a negative impact from tariffs of SEK 33 M, which weighed on the margin performance by 90 bps. The negative impact was partly offset by price improvements. Adjusted EBIT margin for the first quarter came in at 6.5 percent, compared to 7.4 percent in the same period last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher amortization and lower capitalization, although this was partly offset by reduced selling and administrative expenses, reflecting the effect from our continued cost-saving initiatives. Operating cash flow after continuous investments improved by SEK 529 million, reaching SEK -361 million in the first quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by improved working capital management. Investor update On June 10, we held an Investor Update with the purpose of providing an update of our progress across several key projects as well as presenting the strong fundamentals of the radiation therapy industry. We reiterated the roadmap to achieve our mid-term financial objectives. This includes restoring the gross margin to pre-pandemic levels and reaching an EBIT margin of at least 14 percent. Key drivers are growing volumes, enhanced pricing supported by new product launches, an improved product mix, and accelerated expansion in mature markets. As part of our commitment to operational excellence, we also presented the result of a proactive order review aimed at increasing the quality of the backlog to improve profitability and predictability. Commercial milestones During the quarter, we delivered several important commercial wins with Elekta Evo and our software suite Elekta ONE. For example, we concluded a comprehensive deal including some of our most advanced solutions to the University of Texas Southwestern. Leksell Gamma Knife received FDA 510(k) clearance for treating a certain type of epilepsy, which is an important step towards expanding the scope of radiosurgery. We have also noted that the ERECT trial, demonstrating Elekta Unity’s capability to treat prostate cancer while preserving erectile function, has gained significant attention. Outlook We expect net sales for Q2 to be negatively impacted by a continued weak US development as well as a negative effect from last year's low order intake in China. However, we expect sales in China to start to recover during the second half of 2025/26. Furthermore, we expect a continuous negative impact on earnings from FX at current exchange rates and from tariffs in Q2. We reiterate our full year 2025/26 outlook, where we expect net sales in constant currency to grow year-over-year. I would like to end my CEO comment by welcoming Jakob Just-Bomholt as Elekta’s new CEO. Jakob is a highly experienced international executive with a successful career and CEO positions in various global industries, including the medtech sector. Jakob will assume his new role as CEO on September 1.

We are also seeing steady progress in our Healthcare segment, where RTX products remain critical components in advanced patient monitoring systems. Although short order cycles continue to limit forecast visibility, demand patterns across quarters are becoming more stable. We are increasing our efforts to follow ongoing market dynamics and trends, in order to better align with customer expectations and evolving market demands. At the end of June, we raised our full-year guidance, as strong Q3 result became evident and several orders for Q4 were secured. U.S. tariffs continue to create uncertainty, and we are working closely with our large international customers to find the best solutions. With strong expertise and a global customer base, the Company has a solid foundation. By expanding our footprint and focusing on strategic priorities, we are reinforcing our ability to drive sustainable growth and long-term value .” Henrik Mørck Mogensen, CEO FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Revenue for Q3 2024/25 increased by 3.5% year on year to 146.9 DKKm, compared to 141.9 DKKm in Q3 2023/24. Adjusted for currency effects, revenue for the quarter increased by 9.9%. For the first nine months of 2024/25, revenue rose by 16.7% year on year to 407.3 DKKm, and by 18.0% when adjusted for currency effects. Gross margin reached 51.7% for Q3 2024/25, and 50.7% for the first 9M 2024/25. Gross margin improved due to a favourable product mix and higher revenue from the Healthcare segment. EBITDA reached 15.0 DKKm for Q3 2024/25, and 22.2 DKKm for 9M 2024/25 (Q3 2023/24: 9.4 DKKm, 9M: -20.1 DKKm). GUIDANCE On 23 June 2025, RTX adjusted the guidance for 2024/25, and with the announcement of this interim report the intervals are narrowed by raising the lower range of EBITDA and EBIT by 10 DKKm: Revenue DKK 530 to 560 million (from DKK 490 to 530 million) EBITDA DKK 25 to 35 million (from DKK 0 to 20 million) EBIT DKK -5 to 5 million (from DKK -35 to -15 million) BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Continued strong performance in Enterprise segment driven mainly by customers in the retail sector and long-term customers demand across applications. The Healthcare segment delivered solid revenue growth, driven by sales of RTX products used in patient monitoring systems. While the order horizon remains short and creates uncertainty in our forecast, we see more stable and even demand patterns between quarters. Reduction in inventory from 74.1 DKKm in Q2 to 56.5 DKKm in Q3, mainly due to reduction in component inventory. Increase in guidance for the financial year 2024/25 was communicated on 23 June 2025.

The reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is presented on page 18 of the interim report. CEO Pietu Parikka’s review “The car market continued to be challenging in the second quarter of 2025. During April–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s con-tinuing operations were EUR 109.0 million (117.3 million), adjusted EBITDA was EUR 2.3 million (2.8 million), and the adjust-ed operating profit was a loss of EUR -1.4 million (-0.7 million). Wetteri’s revenue of continuing operations for January–June was EUR 224.5 (244.1) million, its adjusted EBITDA was EUR 4.6 (6.7) million, and its adjusted operating result was EUR -2.8 (0.1) million. The loss for the period before taxes for continuing operations was EUR -8.8 (-8.3) million. Profitability was bur-dened by subdued market demand and the resulting price competition, low sales efficiency and weak working capital turno-ver. In January–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s Passenger Cars segment decreased by 13% year-on-year and amounted to EUR 162.5 million. The adjusted operating profit of the Passenger Cars segment showed a loss, amounting to EUR -4.1 million. The number of new car orders during January-June was 2,100 units, which is 11.7 percent more than in the corresponding period of the previous year. An increase in order volumes was seen toward the end of the review period. In January–June, Wetteri’s invoiced sales of new cars totalled 1,989 (1,994) units, which was in line with the previous year’s figures. Order and invoicing volumes were influenced, among other things, by new car brand representations. In line with our strategy, we ex-panded our operations in early 2025 by opening a new full-service dealership in Lahti, featuring brand representation for Kia, Mitsubishi and Mazda. After the review period, we also announced the launch of Mercedes-Benz representation in Lahti, start-ing in August 2025. The new market area and strong brands provide a solid foundation for increasing sales potential in the Päijät-Häme economic region. Competition in the used car trade remained intense, while demand was subdued, which was reflected in car prices and slow inventory turnover. During the six-month reporting period, 4,200 (4,965) used cars were sold, and their invoicing decreased by 15.4% year-on-year. The inventory optimisation measures initiated in the first quarter continued into the second quarter, including efforts to improve working capital turnover. The impacts of these measures are expected to materialise during the second half of 2025, providing a strong foundation for a turnaround in the profitability of the used car business. Towards the end of the first half of the year, we began to see positive signs in the unit profitability of sold vehicles and in the development of sales of the Wetteri Turva additional service. The weak performance in car sales also had an impact on maintenance and repair shop operations. The revenue of the Maintenance Services segment in January–June was EUR 46.2 (49.3) million, and its adjusted operating profit was EUR 1.0 (2.4) million. The number of damage repairs decreased as a result of the mild winter. Due to the uneven distribution of demand, there were significant differences in profitability between locations. For example, the maintenance and damage repair workshops at our new locations in Lempäälä and Lahti were still in the start-up phase during the review period. Performance improvement measures will be planned for low-profitability locations during the remainder of the year. The revenue of the Heavy Equipment segment developed favourably during the review period and amounted to EUR 14.1 (7.1) million. During the review period, we discontinued the importing of SANY earth-moving machinery. In May, we launched a profitability program aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and unit margins, improving working capital turnover, and reducing capital tied up in operations as well as indebtedness. The measures will be fully reflected in the results during 2026. Wetteri’s financial position already improved in January–June 2025 thanks to the Wetteri Power transaction and profitability measures: interest-bearing debt decreased by a total of EUR 24.8 million, and our equity ratio improved to 20 percent. During the review period, we made preparations for the sale of our heavy equipment maintenance and spare parts operations in Joensuu and Kajaani. The transaction was signed on 7 July 2025 and will be completed during the second half of 2025. The transaction further strengthens Wetteri’s self-sufficiency and creates a foundation for further business development. I started as the CEO of Wetteri at the beginning of August, after which we also renewed the composition of the management team. In the current challenging market situation, we continue to improve profitability and focus on enhancing efficiency. The strategy update process is also progressing, and we will publish our updated strategy in the second half of 2025. Due to the company’s financial situation and weaker-than-expected market development, we initiated change negotiations on 27 August 2025. The negotiations concern the personnel of Wetteri Yhtiöt Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, excluding mechanics. The aim is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the goal is to harmonize job descriptions and align organizational structures. If implemented, the measures may result in certain positions being discontinued or reorganized. Towards the end of the review period, cautious signs of a pick-up in car sales began to emerge in the market. The used car market is stabilising, and the prices of used cars are beginning to level out. The sales of new cars also appear to be developing positively toward the end of the year, with an increase in demand for electric cars. Affordable new electric vehicle models are entering the market, lowering the average price of new cars and thereby reducing the threshold for customers to purchase a new car. We also believe that the new scrapping bonus campaign presented by the government will support the development of the market. During the remainder of the year, we will continue measures to achieve synergy benefits from acquisitions and improve profitability. Wetteri holds significant potential, and by harnessing this potential, we can take major steps forward in our development. By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025. Registrations of new cars fell short of the levels projected by the automotive forecasting group. Based on the growth outlook for the automotive sector, an increase of around 10% was projected for 2025 at the end of 2024. However, in January–June 2025, registrations of new passenger cars were 4.9% lower than in the corresponding period in the previous year. In the used car trade, the unit price level has been low, but the market is now stabilising and showing signs of percentage growth. In April, Wetteri launched a profitability programme aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability. The full impact of the programme is expected to materialise during 2026. In August 2025, the company initiated change negotiations due to its financial situation and weaker-than-expected market demand. The objective of the negotiations is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of EUR 4 million. In May, Wetteri withdrew its guidance for 2025 due to increased market uncertainty. The company will review the possibility of issuing new guidance once the strategy work has been completed.

The reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is presented on page 18 of the interim report. CEO Pietu Parikka’s review “The car market continued to be challenging in the second quarter of 2025. During April–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s con-tinuing operations were EUR 109.0 million (117.3 million), adjusted EBITDA was EUR 2.3 million (2.8 million), and the adjust-ed operating profit was a loss of EUR -1.4 million (-0.7 million). Wetteri’s revenue of continuing operations for January–June was EUR 224.5 (244.1) million, its adjusted EBITDA was EUR 4.6 (6.7) million, and its adjusted operating result was EUR -2.8 (0.1) million. The loss for the period before taxes for continuing operations was EUR -8.8 (-8.3) million. Profitability was bur-dened by subdued market demand and the resulting price competition, low sales efficiency and weak working capital turno-ver. In January–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s Passenger Cars segment decreased by 13% year-on-year and amounted to EUR 162.5 million. The adjusted operating profit of the Passenger Cars segment showed a loss, amounting to EUR -4.1 million. The number of new car orders during January-June was 2,100 units, which is 11.7 percent more than in the corresponding period of the previous year. An increase in order volumes was seen toward the end of the review period. In January–June, Wetteri’s invoiced sales of new cars totalled 1,989 (1,994) units, which was in line with the previous year’s figures. Order and invoicing volumes were influenced, among other things, by new car brand representations. In line with our strategy, we ex-panded our operations in early 2025 by opening a new full-service dealership in Lahti, featuring brand representation for Kia, Mitsubishi and Mazda. After the review period, we also announced the launch of Mercedes-Benz representation in Lahti, start-ing in August 2025. The new market area and strong brands provide a solid foundation for increasing sales potential in the Päijät-Häme economic region. Competition in the used car trade remained intense, while demand was subdued, which was reflected in car prices and slow inventory turnover. During the six-month reporting period, 4,200 (4,965) used cars were sold, and their invoicing decreased by 15.4% year-on-year. The inventory optimisation measures initiated in the first quarter continued into the second quarter, including efforts to improve working capital turnover. The impacts of these measures are expected to materialise during the second half of 2025, providing a strong foundation for a turnaround in the profitability of the used car business. Towards the end of the first half of the year, we began to see positive signs in the unit profitability of sold vehicles and in the development of sales of the Wetteri Turva additional service. The weak performance in car sales also had an impact on maintenance and repair shop operations. The revenue of the Maintenance Services segment in January–June was EUR 46.2 (49.3) million, and its adjusted operating profit was EUR 1.0 (2.4) million. The number of damage repairs decreased as a result of the mild winter. Due to the uneven distribution of demand, there were significant differences in profitability between locations. For example, the maintenance and damage repair workshops at our new locations in Lempäälä and Lahti were still in the start-up phase during the review period. Performance improvement measures will be planned for low-profitability locations during the remainder of the year. The revenue of the Heavy Equipment segment developed favourably during the review period and amounted to EUR 14.1 (7.1) million. During the review period, we discontinued the importing of SANY earth-moving machinery. In May, we launched a profitability program aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and unit margins, improving working capital turnover, and reducing capital tied up in operations as well as indebtedness. The measures will be fully reflected in the results during 2026. Wetteri’s financial position already improved in January–June 2025 thanks to the Wetteri Power transaction and profitability measures: interest-bearing debt decreased by a total of EUR 24.8 million, and our equity ratio improved to 20 percent. During the review period, we made preparations for the sale of our heavy equipment maintenance and spare parts operations in Joensuu and Kajaani. The transaction was signed on 7 July 2025 and will be completed during the second half of 2025. The transaction further strengthens Wetteri’s self-sufficiency and creates a foundation for further business development. I started as the CEO of Wetteri at the beginning of August, after which we also renewed the composition of the management team. In the current challenging market situation, we continue to improve profitability and focus on enhancing efficiency. The strategy update process is also progressing, and we will publish our updated strategy in the second half of 2025. Due to the company’s financial situation and weaker-than-expected market development, we initiated change negotiations on 27 August 2025. The negotiations concern the personnel of Wetteri Yhtiöt Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, excluding mechanics. The aim is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the goal is to harmonize job descriptions and align organizational structures. If implemented, the measures may result in certain positions being discontinued or reorganized. Towards the end of the review period, cautious signs of a pick-up in car sales began to emerge in the market. The used car market is stabilising, and the prices of used cars are beginning to level out. The sales of new cars also appear to be developing positively toward the end of the year, with an increase in demand for electric cars. Affordable new electric vehicle models are entering the market, lowering the average price of new cars and thereby reducing the threshold for customers to purchase a new car. We also believe that the new scrapping bonus campaign presented by the government will support the development of the market. During the remainder of the year, we will continue measures to achieve synergy benefits from acquisitions and improve profitability. Wetteri holds significant potential, and by harnessing this potential, we can take major steps forward in our development. By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025. Registrations of new cars fell short of the levels projected by the automotive forecasting group. Based on the growth outlook for the automotive sector, an increase of around 10% was projected for 2025 at the end of 2024. However, in January–June 2025, registrations of new passenger cars were 4.9% lower than in the corresponding period in the previous year. In the used car trade, the unit price level has been low, but the market is now stabilising and showing signs of percentage growth. In April, Wetteri launched a profitability programme aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability. The full impact of the programme is expected to materialise during 2026. In August 2025, the company initiated change negotiations due to its financial situation and weaker-than-expected market demand. The objective of the negotiations is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of EUR 4 million. In May, Wetteri withdrew its guidance for 2025 due to increased market uncertainty. The company will review the possibility of issuing new guidance once the strategy work has been completed.

By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025. Registrations of new cars fell short of the levels projected by the automotive forecasting group. Based on the growth outlook for the automotive sector, an increase of around 10% was projected for 2025 at the end of 2024. However, in January–June 2025, registrations of new passenger cars were 4.9% lower than in the corresponding period in the previous year. In the used car trade, the unit price level has been low, but the market is now stabilising and showing signs of percentage growth. In April, Wetteri launched a profitability programme aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability. The full impact of the programme is expected to materialise during 2026. In August 2025, the company initiated change negotiations due to its financial situation and weaker-than-expected market demand. The objective of the negotiations is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of EUR 4 million. In May, Wetteri withdrew its guidance for 2025 due to increased market uncertainty. The company will review the possibility of issuing new guidance once the strategy work has been completed.

The reconciliation of the adjusted EBITDA and operating profit is presented on page 18 of the interim report. CEO Pietu Parikka’s review “The car market continued to be challenging in the second quarter of 2025. During April–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s con-tinuing operations were EUR 109.0 million (117.3 million), adjusted EBITDA was EUR 2.3 million (2.8 million), and the adjust-ed operating profit was a loss of EUR -1.4 million (-0.7 million). Wetteri’s revenue of continuing operations for January–June was EUR 224.5 (244.1) million, its adjusted EBITDA was EUR 4.6 (6.7) million, and its adjusted operating result was EUR -2.8 (0.1) million. The loss for the period before taxes for continuing operations was EUR -8.8 (-8.3) million. Profitability was bur-dened by subdued market demand and the resulting price competition, low sales efficiency and weak working capital turno-ver. In January–June, the revenue of Wetteri’s Passenger Cars segment decreased by 13% year-on-year and amounted to EUR 162.5 million. The adjusted operating profit of the Passenger Cars segment showed a loss, amounting to EUR -4.1 million. The number of new car orders during January-June was 2,100 units, which is 11.7 percent more than in the corresponding period of the previous year. An increase in order volumes was seen toward the end of the review period. In January–June, Wetteri’s invoiced sales of new cars totalled 1,989 (1,994) units, which was in line with the previous year’s figures. Order and invoicing volumes were influenced, among other things, by new car brand representations. In line with our strategy, we ex-panded our operations in early 2025 by opening a new full-service dealership in Lahti, featuring brand representation for Kia, Mitsubishi and Mazda. After the review period, we also announced the launch of Mercedes-Benz representation in Lahti, start-ing in August 2025. The new market area and strong brands provide a solid foundation for increasing sales potential in the Päijät-Häme economic region. Competition in the used car trade remained intense, while demand was subdued, which was reflected in car prices and slow inventory turnover. During the six-month reporting period, 4,200 (4,965) used cars were sold, and their invoicing decreased by 15.4% year-on-year. The inventory optimisation measures initiated in the first quarter continued into the second quarter, including efforts to improve working capital turnover. The impacts of these measures are expected to materialise during the second half of 2025, providing a strong foundation for a turnaround in the profitability of the used car business. Towards the end of the first half of the year, we began to see positive signs in the unit profitability of sold vehicles and in the development of sales of the Wetteri Turva additional service. The weak performance in car sales also had an impact on maintenance and repair shop operations. The revenue of the Maintenance Services segment in January–June was EUR 46.2 (49.3) million, and its adjusted operating profit was EUR 1.0 (2.4) million. The number of damage repairs decreased as a result of the mild winter. Due to the uneven distribution of demand, there were significant differences in profitability between locations. For example, the maintenance and damage repair workshops at our new locations in Lempäälä and Lahti were still in the start-up phase during the review period. Performance improvement measures will be planned for low-profitability locations during the remainder of the year. The revenue of the Heavy Equipment segment developed favourably during the review period and amounted to EUR 14.1 (7.1) million. During the review period, we discontinued the importing of SANY earth-moving machinery. In May, we launched a profitability program aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability by enhancing the quality of revenue and unit margins, improving working capital turnover, and reducing capital tied up in operations as well as indebtedness. The measures will be fully reflected in the results during 2026. Wetteri’s financial position already improved in January–June 2025 thanks to the Wetteri Power transaction and profitability measures: interest-bearing debt decreased by a total of EUR 24.8 million, and our equity ratio improved to 20 percent. During the review period, we made preparations for the sale of our heavy equipment maintenance and spare parts operations in Joensuu and Kajaani. The transaction was signed on 7 July 2025 and will be completed during the second half of 2025. The transaction further strengthens Wetteri’s self-sufficiency and creates a foundation for further business development. I started as the CEO of Wetteri at the beginning of August, after which we also renewed the composition of the management team. In the current challenging market situation, we continue to improve profitability and focus on enhancing efficiency. The strategy update process is also progressing, and we will publish our updated strategy in the second half of 2025. Due to the company’s financial situation and weaker-than-expected market development, we initiated change negotiations on 27 August 2025. The negotiations concern the personnel of Wetteri Yhtiöt Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, excluding mechanics. The aim is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the goal is to harmonize job descriptions and align organizational structures. If implemented, the measures may result in certain positions being discontinued or reorganized. Towards the end of the review period, cautious signs of a pick-up in car sales began to emerge in the market. The used car market is stabilising, and the prices of used cars are beginning to level out. The sales of new cars also appear to be developing positively toward the end of the year, with an increase in demand for electric cars. Affordable new electric vehicle models are entering the market, lowering the average price of new cars and thereby reducing the threshold for customers to purchase a new car. We also believe that the new scrapping bonus campaign presented by the government will support the development of the market. During the remainder of the year, we will continue measures to achieve synergy benefits from acquisitions and improve profitability. Wetteri holds significant potential, and by harnessing this potential, we can take major steps forward in our development. By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025.

The strategy update process is also progressing, and we will publish our updated strategy in the second half of 2025. Due to the company’s financial situation and weaker-than-expected market development, we initiated change negotiations on 27 August 2025. The negotiations concern the personnel of Wetteri Yhtiöt Oy and Wetteri Auto Oy, excluding mechanics. The aim is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of approximately EUR 4 million. In addition, the goal is to harmonize job descriptions and align organizational structures. If implemented, the measures may result in certain positions being discontinued or reorganized. Towards the end of the review period, cautious signs of a pick-up in car sales began to emerge in the market. The used car market is stabilising, and the prices of used cars are beginning to level out. The sales of new cars also appear to be developing positively toward the end of the year, with an increase in demand for electric cars. Affordable new electric vehicle models are entering the market, lowering the average price of new cars and thereby reducing the threshold for customers to purchase a new car. We also believe that the new scrapping bonus campaign presented by the government will support the development of the market. During the remainder of the year, we will continue measures to achieve synergy benefits from acquisitions and improve profitability. Wetteri holds significant potential, and by harnessing this potential, we can take major steps forward in our development. By focusing on sales management, the more efficient use of financial and human resources and the development of used car sales, and by ensuring an even better customer experience, we are laying a strong foundation for business recovery and sustainable growth.” Estimate of future developments in the industry and the company The Finnish car trade did not meet growth expectations in the first half of 2025. Registrations of new cars fell short of the levels projected by the automotive forecasting group. Based on the growth outlook for the automotive sector, an increase of around 10% was projected for 2025 at the end of 2024. However, in January–June 2025, registrations of new passenger cars were 4.9% lower than in the corresponding period in the previous year. In the used car trade, the unit price level has been low, but the market is now stabilising and showing signs of percentage growth. In April, Wetteri launched a profitability programme aimed at achieving an annual improvement of EUR 8 million in profitability. The full impact of the programme is expected to materialise during 2026. In August 2025, the company initiated change negotiations due to its financial situation and weaker-than-expected market demand. The objective of the negotiations is to achieve annual personnel cost savings of EUR 4 million. In May, Wetteri withdrew its guidance for 2025 due to increased market uncertainty. The company will review the possibility of issuing new guidance once the strategy work has been completed.

CEO's Comments on Q2 2025 Performance A solid quarter dominated by app store rulings and FX swings. We started Q2 with strong momentum in distribution, building on the success of Q1's new game launches. I am pleased to say that the new games are already contributing with more than USD 600k in revenue per month and supported our continued growth in the quarter. In USD terms, Distribution revenue was up 4% and Audiencly by 5% year-on-year. While our total reported revenue in GBP saw a 4% decline due to a weaker USD, this does not reflect our underlying performance. Audiencly's return to profitability in Q2 came on the back of a record number of clients served in Q1 with an average margin for the first half of the year at approximately 30%. Despite the typically slower summer period and a challenging market for games, we met our revenue guidance. Notably, our game portfolio and channels significantly outperformed its Google Play equivalents which experienced a 27% decline in the same period based on AppMagic figures, underscoring the clear shift towards alternative markets, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) channels. In Q2, we made progress on game launches and sourcing. We successfully signed ""Realms of Pixel"" and officially launched EA's ""Golf Clash."" We also secured another top 5 grossing game, yet to be fully launched. Looking ahead to Q3, our game portfolio now features 34 games and is expected to include four Top 10 grossing games (based on Google Play ranking). The average monthly revenue of our top tier games in Q2 was USD 700k. Having secured 4 out of 10 top grossing games is a major achievement for Flexion, making us uniquely attractive to existing and new distribution channels, as well as marketing and payment partners. This strategic advantage should help us maintain current momentum and secure more new deals into the autumn. I anticipate performance to pick up towards the end of Q3 once the summer period concludes, expecting revenue in the range of USD 21-24 million for the quarter. As highlighted in Q1, the amortization of our game distribution rights has significantly decreased, with our largest deal now fully amortized, leading to a closer alignment between our adjusted EBITDA and operating result. As our largest deal transitioned back to standard terms, our distribution gross margin declined as expected, reflecting the contractual shift in economics once our investment in the game was recouped. This outcome underscores both our commitment to bringing successful titles to alternative app stores and the underlying strength of these top-grossing games. Meanwhile, Audiencly’s gross margin improved, contributing to a consolidated company gross margin of 14%. I am also pleased to report that we have successfully extended and renewed several crucial developer agreements, providing greater revenue visibility over the next few years. We are in a strong financial position, with GBP 13.3 million in the bank and no debt, enabling us to continue strategic investments such as in our D2C initiatives. Total investment in product development so far this year is approximately GBP 0.4m. The alternative market continues to be shaped by pivotal legal decisions, with court rulings against Apple and Google in the US, alongside enforcement actions by the EU and other regulatory bodies in major mobile games markets. It is unequivocally clear that the long-standing ""walls"" of control on both iOS (Apple) and Android (Google Play) are coming down, and this shift is irreversible. This paradigm creates unprecedented new market opportunities for game developers and service providers. The growth of the mobile games market has long been constrained by Google and Apple's strict control. We firmly believe it is now poised to re-enter a period of growth, as increased developer freedoms, higher margins, and intensified competition will collectively drive significant investment and expansion in game marketing. For example, we are seeing increased capital investment activity in D2C payment and web store startups. For instance, Appcharge, a payments company we are working with, recently raised USD 58 million, bringing their total funding over the past nine months to USD 89 million. Besides continued investment in our SDK, our support for D2C includes integrations with Appcharge for in-app payments, alongside Xsolla and Coda Payments. On the product development side, we are also adding support for the Epic Games Store this year. Over the past 12 months, we have streamlined operations in Distribution, reducing headcount by 8% while improving overall efficiency. At the same time, we continue to invest in product development. Our teams recently returned from China Joy, Asia's largest game show and Gamescom in Europe, and the trend is clear: alternative stores are now firmly integrated into most game developers' user acquisition strategies, as return on ad spend (ROAS) can be higher due to more attractive payouts from these stores. This is a very important first step as the pace of change will depend heavily on paid user acquisition being funnelled through to new and high margin stores and D2C. We continue to develop expertise in user acquisition for the alternative markets and are seeing strong performance with certain games and channel combinations. For both existing and new stores, the ability to offer their services through Google Play thanks to the recent rulings will be tremendously beneficial, significantly reducing user friction and greatly assisting with user acquisition. We believe this will lead to an increased number of stores and empower developers to transform their web stores into powerful distribution channels over time. We are actively building for this open, competitive market, which represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity for developers. With our strong game and store partnerships, we are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalise on these emerging opportunities, and it is crucial that we continue to strategically invest in our robust service offering to remain at the forefront as the market transitions. I will continue to update you on our progress in these areas in Q3 and wish you a happy end to the summer season.

Revenue for H1 increased by 21%, while capacity costs (other external expenses and staff costs) in the same period increased by 14%, contributing to improvement in EBITDA and lower cash burn from operations. Impero maintains the updated outlook for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range, and EBITDA in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025). SaaS metrics and financial highlights on 30 June 2025 ARR increased by 15% to DKK 40.7M, from DKK 35.4M on 30 June 2024 Net ARR growth in H1-2025 amounted to DKK 2.0M, compared to DKK 5.0M in H1-2024 Uplift was 6% YoY, compared to 13% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Churn was 2%, YoY compared to 4% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Net Revenue Retention was 105% compared to 109% in the 12-month period ending 30 June 2024 Revenue for H1-2025 increased by 21% to DKK 20.1M, compared to the same period in 2024 EBITDA for H1-2025 was negative DKK 4.2M, compared to negative DKK 5.1M for the first half of 2024 During the first half of 2025, Impero welcomed 9 new customers across Germany, the UK, and Denmark. These organizations span industries including financial services, manufacturing, shipping, and IT services. By the end of H1 2025, Impero served 32% of the Danish C25 index and 20% of the German DAX 40 index, with the majority of the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) generated outside Denmark. While Q1 typically shows limited momentum due to customers’ fiscal year-end processes, Q2 is traditionally a stronger period. However, Q2 2025 fell short of expectations, with macroeconomic uncertainty where potential new customers seemed more cautious than usual. Despite this, we achieved gross ARR growth of DKK 3.5M in H1 2025. This was largely driven by significant upsell activity among existing customers, especially large enterprises in Germany’s automotive and manufacturing sectors, as well as customers in other markets who are expanding the use of Impero across their organizations. However, contractions impacted our net new ARR which ended at DKK 2M for the period. Due to continued focus on customer success and platform adoption, churn remained below 2% over the past 12 months. “While the first half of the year presented some challenges, we remain optimistic. Market potential is intact, and Impero is well positioned to continue our growth journey. We see strong demand for our intuitive, easy-to-implement platform that enables organizations to meet rising requirements for risk management and internal controls. With a remarkable customer base, an expanding partner network, a strengthened team, and enhanced product development, we are well equipped for the road ahead”, says CEO Rikke Stampe Skov. Partnerships to support growth Partnerships continue to be a strategic pillar in our efforts to help organizations navigate compliance challenges. We collaborate closely with experts in governance, risk, and compliance, particularly across tax and finance domains. These partnerships support efficient implementation of Impero and provide access to best practice templates developed by our partners. Of new ARR generated in H1 2025, 33% originated through the partner channel. As a result of ongoing investments in partner development, we saw greater engagement throughout H1 particularly in Germany, where we onboarded new partners and secured our first customers through two of these. We believe the partner channel will remain a key driver for growth. Enhancing platform value The first half of 2025 marked a significant step forward in our mission to simplify compliance through strengthening risk & internal control management for enterprise- and highly-regulated organizations. Guided by our strategic direction, we focus on delivering high-impact capabilities that expand our platform’s value, improve operational oversight, and support more efficient workflows. Following a successful beta period throughout H1 2025, we launched Control Testing into general availability in July 2025. This module introduces a structured, audit-friendly way to assess the effectiveness of internal controls empowering organizations to proactively identify weaknesses, refine processes, and strengthen overall compliance assurance. In alignment with our general practices, Control Testing has been developed with extensive feedback from our customers, and we are already seeing solid interest from new and existing customers with several beta customers already using the feature to embed proactive testing into their compliance frameworks. Strategy update As part of our 2026 strategy “Increasing the Impact”, we remain focused on enhancing platform capabilities and accelerating delivery speed. We are investing in Product and Development team capacity, while also scaling our go-to-market efforts across geographies and channels to drive pipeline development and market expansion. Following limited traction with templated compliance solutions in the mid-market, and based on the EU Omnibus package, we will continue to concentrate on the enterprise segment where we have a proven track record of attracting and expanding customer relationships. This focused approach means we do not anticipate doubling our customer base by the end of 2026. Though ARR growth in H1 2025 was more modest than anticipated, we remain confident in being able to become cash flow positive before the end of 2026. Equity and capital Impero maintained a solid cash position of DKK 6.8M at the end of H1 2025. The company continues to apply a balanced approach to investment and cash generation, ensuring sufficient liquidity to pursue its strategic plan. As of 30 June 2025, Impero’s equity stood at DKK 0.2M, compared to DKK 6.2M at 31 December 2024. This reduction, which represents a loss of more than 50% of the company’s share capital, reflects the investments made to support long-term growth. It is not unusual for SaaS companies in growth phases to experience periods of negative equity as product development and market scaling are prioritized over short-term profitability. Despite this equity shortfall, Impero remains in a solid financial position. In accordance with the Danish Companies Act, the Board of Directors is currently assessing options to address the equity position. If relevant, an update will be provided at a general assembly no later than the end of November 2025. Organizational developments As communicated in Company Announcement 09-2025, our CFO Morten Lehmann Nielsen will be stepping down at the end of August to pursue a career opportunity outside of Impero. We thank Morten for his contribution over the past 3½ years and wish him all the best in his future role. On 25 August 2025 Impero announced the appointment of Kasper Lihn as CFO, effective 1 October 2025 (Company Announcement No. 15-2025). We are excited to welcome Kasper, who joins Impero from HC Andersen Capital, where he holds the position Head of Research and Managing Director. Outlook Impero maintains the updated ARR guidance for the full year of 2025 (Company Announcement No. 13-2025) with ARR within the 43M to 46M range. The outlook corresponds to an expected annual ARR growth rate between 11% and 19%. The company’s EBITDA is expected to be in the range of DKK -6M to -4M (Company Announcement No. 14-2025), with continued focus on cost discipline in light of Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) developing below initial expectations, impacting the timing of new initiatives. For the full outlook, we refer to page 8 in the H1 Report 2025. Presentation of the Report Read the Report in its entirety via or in the attached. CEO Rikke Stampe Skov will present the H1 Report at a webinar on 4 September 2025, at 1:00 PM CET (in Danish).

Comment from the CEO Klimator holds a truly unique position in the market through our ability to base our analyses and forecasts on the local climate. We let factors such as topography, proximity to water, and elevation differences form the foundation for calculating the actual outcome on the ground. This enables us to predict when, where, and how roads will become slippery – with a precision few can match. This capability is the foundation of our core products and drives our growth, where high-quality revenues from Road Status Information and IoT road weather stations create a stable and scalable business. We are pleased to note that the turn around we have driven over the past two years is now starting to show in the numbers. The quarter, which is normally weaker due to seasonal variations, improved significantly – driven by existing customers placing hardware orders earlier, expanding with additional contracts, and by a steady increase in recurring software revenues. The company’s total revenue increased by 51% to MSEK 9,346 (MSEK 6,174) for the second quarter of 2025. Net sales for Q2 2025 amounted to MSEK 7,955, an increase of 70% compared to 2024. We also achieved a significant profit improvement of MSEK 2,300 for the period. Revenue and earnings growth are driven by high-quality revenues from long-term customers, not by public funding or capitalization of work in progress. During the past quarter, we have also strengthened Klimator’s forward trajectory in continuing to lead the digital and automated transformation of winter road maintenance. Through the recently completed investment round – in which both long-term external shareholders and Klimator Board and management participated – we have secured approximately MSEK 9.5 to accelerate our business. This capital enables the scaling and commercialization of our most innovative solutions, with Klimator Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting at the forefront. These technologies allow winter operations to be adapted in real time to current and forecasted road conditions – with clear effects on traffic safety, cost efficiency, and environmental impact. Opportunities are substantial, as the industry is in the start of a transformation where digitalization, data, and AI are rapidly shifting decision-making from reactive to proactive. Here, Klimator has a unique position thanks to our combination of road climatology research, multiple data sources processed with AI, and proven system solutions. Our vision is clear: to become the preferred partner for national road authorities, contractors, and municipalities that want to streamline, automate, and future-proof their winter operations. Going forward, we focus on turning our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth through high-quality revenues. We will achieve this through more strategic partnerships, expanded presence in key markets, and a strong focus on recurring revenues – with the ability to deliver value to customers, society, and shareholders. Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Going forward, our focus is on transforming our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth with high-quality revenues. This will be achieved by combining innovation with commercial strength, with the goal of creating long-term value for customers, society, and shareholders. We will achieve this by: Building more strategic partnerships with distributors and expanding our presence in key markets Increasing the share of recurring revenues through Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting Ensuring strong delivery capacity and quality Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Emil Danielsson, CEO Klimator AB About Klimator History Klimator is a Swedish software company that was founded in 2001 by Torbjörn Gustafsson and Jörgen Bogren. The founders have over 30 years of research experience in applied road climatology at the University of Gothenburg. Klimator’s technology is based on years of academic research into road weather conditions. In 2020, the company acquired HedeDanmark’s connected sensors (IoT) business to expand and strengthen Klimator’s product portfolio. Business areas To serve the market segments and customer groups addressed, Klimator’s activities are organized into two distinct business areas: Business Area Winter Maintenance Business Area Automotive In the Winter Maintenance business area, the company offers a web-based software application, Road Status Information (RSI), based on the company’s Road Condition Data (RCD) platform. The software is customized for the needs winter contractors face when making critical decisions about when and how to implement specific measures and how much salt or sand to lay down. Klimator’s software results in significant cost savings for an industry with annual revenues of around SEK 3 billion in Sweden alone. More efficient wintertime road maintenance also brings major environmental benefits, such as lower salt usage, lower fuel consumption, and less wear and tear on roads. The company’s IoT sensors give contractors, municipalities, and other organizations the ability to measure road surface temperature, air temperature, air humidity, rainfall, ground moisture, groundwater level, water level, and hydraulic flow in real-timI. With the help of sensors, data is collected and stored in Klimator’s IoT platform, where customers can avail themselves of a number of different services. For the customer, it’s a simple and easy introduction to a more modern, digital way to work. The company focuses on IoT sensors connected to winter road maintenance but offers other sensors as a service to existing customers. After establishing the Automotive business area late in 2019, the company carried out a number of successful Proof of Concept (PoC) and developmental projects with leading European and Japanese vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. There are several highly attractive areas of application for the company’s data platform (RCD) and sensor technology (AHEAD) within the automotive industry with respect to: improved driver information improved use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) safe and scalable Autonomous Driving technology (AD) Product portfolio Road Condition Data (RCD) is a cloud-based Data-as-a-Service platform (DaaS) that aggregates data from a number of different sources. Advanced climate models and Klimator’s unique classification model for the road network are used in tandem to process this data and deliver detailed real-time information and predictive forecasts about road weather conditions. This information can be applied in a number of different areas in the automotive industry, including intelligent Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and complex systems for autonomous vehicles (AD). Based on RCD, Road Status Information (RSI) is a digital Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that provides detailed forecasts for roads, bike paths, and pedestrian walkways. These high-resolution forecasts are used by transportation agencies and winter road contractors to make critical decisions about when, where, and how to implement snow removal and de-icing measures. Klimator’s forecasts facilitate decision-making, planning, and follow-up and Ilitate more efficient use of resources, which results in significant cost savings and a lessened impact on the environment. AHEAD is a sensor technology that analyzes road conditions and friction in front of a moving vehicle in real-time. The technology is the result of more than ten years of research and development into road condition classification. AHEAD gives vehicle system information about prevailing road conditions, which improves the functionality and utility of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving technology. Klimator’s IoT Road Weather Stations provides real-time information on how weather impacts local road conditions. This data will empower operators to make informed decisions on the appropriate treatments necessary. The data is easily accessible from the Road Status Information (RSI) platform. The data comes in the form of an API so can also be fed into other weather monitoring and forecasting systems if necessary.

Comment from the CEO Klimator holds a truly unique position in the market through our ability to base our analyses and forecasts on the local climate. We let factors such as topography, proximity to water, and elevation differences form the foundation for calculating the actual outcome on the ground. This enables us to predict when, where, and how roads will become slippery – with a precision few can match. This capability is the foundation of our core products and drives our growth, where high-quality revenues from Road Status Information and IoT road weather stations create a stable and scalable business. We are pleased to note that the turn around we have driven over the past two years is now starting to show in the numbers. The quarter, which is normally weaker due to seasonal variations, improved significantly – driven by existing customers placing hardware orders earlier, expanding with additional contracts, and by a steady increase in recurring software revenues. The company’s total revenue increased by 51% to MSEK 9,346 (MSEK 6,174) for the second quarter of 2025. Net sales for Q2 2025 amounted to MSEK 7,955, an increase of 70% compared to 2024. We also achieved a significant profit improvement of MSEK 2,300 for the period. Revenue and earnings growth are driven by high-quality revenues from long-term customers, not by public funding or capitalization of work in progress. During the past quarter, we have also strengthened Klimator’s forward trajectory in continuing to lead the digital and automated transformation of winter road maintenance. Through the recently completed investment round – in which both long-term external shareholders and Klimator Board and management participated – we have secured approximately MSEK 9.5 to accelerate our business. This capital enables the scaling and commercialization of our most innovative solutions, with Klimator Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting at the forefront. These technologies allow winter operations to be adapted in real time to current and forecasted road conditions – with clear effects on traffic safety, cost efficiency, and environmental impact. Opportunities are substantial, as the industry is in the start of a transformation where digitalization, data, and AI are rapidly shifting decision-making from reactive to proactive. Here, Klimator has a unique position thanks to our combination of road climatology research, multiple data sources processed with AI, and proven system solutions. Our vision is clear: to become the preferred partner for national road authorities, contractors, and municipalities that want to streamline, automate, and future-proof their winter operations. Going forward, we focus on turning our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth through high-quality revenues. We will achieve this through more strategic partnerships, expanded presence in key markets, and a strong focus on recurring revenues – with the ability to deliver value to customers, society, and shareholders. Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Going forward, our focus is on transforming our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth with high-quality revenues.

Emil Danielsson, CEO Klimator AB About Klimator History Klimator is a Swedish software company that was founded in 2001 by Torbjörn Gustafsson and Jörgen Bogren. The founders have over 30 years of research experience in applied road climatology at the University of Gothenburg. Klimator’s technology is based on years of academic research into road weather conditions. In 2020, the company acquired HedeDanmark’s connected sensors (IoT) business to expand and strengthen Klimator’s product portfolio. Business areas To serve the market segments and customer groups addressed, Klimator’s activities are organized into two distinct business areas: Business Area Winter Maintenance Business Area Automotive In the Winter Maintenance business area, the company offers a web-based software application, Road Status Information (RSI), based on the company’s Road Condition Data (RCD) platform. The software is customized for the needs winter contractors face when making critical decisions about when and how to implement specific measures and how much salt or sand to lay down. Klimator’s software results in significant cost savings for an industry with annual revenues of around SEK 3 billion in Sweden alone. More efficient wintertime road maintenance also brings major environmental benefits, such as lower salt usage, lower fuel consumption, and less wear and tear on roads. The company’s IoT sensors give contractors, municipalities, and other organizations the ability to measure road surface temperature, air temperature, air humidity, rainfall, ground moisture, groundwater level, water level, and hydraulic flow in real-timI. With the help of sensors, data is collected and stored in Klimator’s IoT platform, where customers can avail themselves of a number of different services. For the customer, it’s a simple and easy introduction to a more modern, digital way to work. The company focuses on IoT sensors connected to winter road maintenance but offers other sensors as a service to existing customers. After establishing the Automotive business area late in 2019, the company carried out a number of successful Proof of Concept (PoC) and developmental projects with leading European and Japanese vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. There are several highly attractive areas of application for the company’s data platform (RCD) and sensor technology (AHEAD) within the automotive industry with respect to: improved driver information improved use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) safe and scalable Autonomous Driving technology (AD) Product portfolio Road Condition Data (RCD) is a cloud-based Data-as-a-Service platform (DaaS) that aggregates data from a number of different sources. Advanced climate models and Klimator’s unique classification model for the road network are used in tandem to process this data and deliver detailed real-time information and predictive forecasts about road weather conditions. This information can be applied in a number of different areas in the automotive industry, including intelligent Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and complex systems for autonomous vehicles (AD). Based on RCD, Road Status Information (RSI) is a digital Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that provides detailed forecasts for roads, bike paths, and pedestrian walkways. These high-resolution forecasts are used by transportation agencies and winter road contractors to make critical decisions about when, where, and how to implement snow removal and de-icing measures. Klimator’s forecasts facilitate decision-making, planning, and follow-up and Ilitate more efficient use of resources, which results in significant cost savings and a lessened impact on the environment. AHEAD is a sensor technology that analyzes road conditions and friction in front of a moving vehicle in real-time. The technology is the result of more than ten years of research and development into road condition classification. AHEAD gives vehicle system information about prevailing road conditions, which improves the functionality and utility of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving technology. Klimator’s IoT Road Weather Stations provides real-time information on how weather impacts local road conditions. This data will empower operators to make informed decisions on the appropriate treatments necessary. The data is easily accessible from the Road Status Information (RSI) platform. The data comes in the form of an API so can also be fed into other weather monitoring and forecasting systems if necessary.

Comment from the CEO Klimator holds a truly unique position in the market through our ability to base our analyses and forecasts on the local climate. We let factors such as topography, proximity to water, and elevation differences form the foundation for calculating the actual outcome on the ground. This enables us to predict when, where, and how roads will become slippery – with a precision few can match. This capability is the foundation of our core products and drives our growth, where high-quality revenues from Road Status Information and IoT road weather stations create a stable and scalable business. We are pleased to note that the turn around we have driven over the past two years is now starting to show in the numbers. The quarter, which is normally weaker due to seasonal variations, improved significantly – driven by existing customers placing hardware orders earlier, expanding with additional contracts, and by a steady increase in recurring software revenues. The company’s total revenue increased by 51% to MSEK 9,346 (MSEK 6,174) for the second quarter of 2025. Net sales for Q2 2025 amounted to MSEK 7,955, an increase of 70% compared to 2024. We also achieved a significant profit improvement of MSEK 2,300 for the period. Revenue and earnings growth are driven by high-quality revenues from long-term customers, not by public funding or capitalization of work in progress. During the past quarter, we have also strengthened Klimator’s forward trajectory in continuing to lead the digital and automated transformation of winter road maintenance. Through the recently completed investment round – in which both long-term external shareholders and Klimator Board and management participated – we have secured approximately MSEK 9.5 to accelerate our business. This capital enables the scaling and commercialization of our most innovative solutions, with Klimator Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting at the forefront. These technologies allow winter operations to be adapted in real time to current and forecasted road conditions – with clear effects on traffic safety, cost efficiency, and environmental impact. Opportunities are substantial, as the industry is in the start of a transformation where digitalization, data, and AI are rapidly shifting decision-making from reactive to proactive. Here, Klimator has a unique position thanks to our combination of road climatology research, multiple data sources processed with AI, and proven system solutions. Our vision is clear: to become the preferred partner for national road authorities, contractors, and municipalities that want to streamline, automate, and future-proof their winter operations. Going forward, we focus on turning our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth through high-quality revenues. We will achieve this through more strategic partnerships, expanded presence in key markets, and a strong focus on recurring revenues – with the ability to deliver value to customers, society, and shareholders. Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Going forward, our focus is on transforming our technological advantage into strong and profitable growth with high-quality revenues. This will be achieved by combining innovation with commercial strength, with the goal of creating long-term value for customers, society, and shareholders. We will achieve this by: Building more strategic partnerships with distributors and expanding our presence in key markets Increasing the share of recurring revenues through Dynamic Salting and Adaptive Salting Ensuring strong delivery capacity and quality Even though Klimator is already leading the industry’s development, we recognize that we are operating in the beginning of a broader global transformation. This both inspires us and gives us confidence as we look toward a very exciting future. Emil Danielsson, CEO Klimator AB About Klimator History Klimator is a Swedish software company that was founded in 2001 by Torbjörn Gustafsson and Jörgen Bogren. The founders have over 30 years of research experience in applied road climatology at the University of Gothenburg. Klimator’s technology is based on years of academic research into road weather conditions. In 2020, the company acquired HedeDanmark’s connected sensors (IoT) business to expand and strengthen Klimator’s product portfolio. Business areas To serve the market segments and customer groups addressed, Klimator’s activities are organized into two distinct business areas: Business Area Winter Maintenance Business Area Automotive In the Winter Maintenance business area, the company offers a web-based software application, Road Status Information (RSI), based on the company’s Road Condition Data (RCD) platform. The software is customized for the needs winter contractors face when making critical decisions about when and how to implement specific measures and how much salt or sand to lay down. Klimator’s software results in significant cost savings for an industry with annual revenues of around SEK 3 billion in Sweden alone. More efficient wintertime road maintenance also brings major environmental benefits, such as lower salt usage, lower fuel consumption, and less wear and tear on roads. The company’s IoT sensors give contractors, municipalities, and other organizations the ability to measure road surface temperature, air temperature, air humidity, rainfall, ground moisture, groundwater level, water level, and hydraulic flow in real-timI. With the help of sensors, data is collected and stored in Klimator’s IoT platform, where customers can avail themselves of a number of different services. For the customer, it’s a simple and easy introduction to a more modern, digital way to work. The company focuses on IoT sensors connected to winter road maintenance but offers other sensors as a service to existing customers. After establishing the Automotive business area late in 2019, the company carried out a number of successful Proof of Concept (PoC) and developmental projects with leading European and Japanese vehicle manufacturers and suppliers. There are several highly attractive areas of application for the company’s data platform (RCD) and sensor technology (AHEAD) within the automotive industry with respect to: improved driver information improved use of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) safe and scalable Autonomous Driving technology (AD) Product portfolio Road Condition Data (RCD) is a cloud-based Data-as-a-Service platform (DaaS) that aggregates data from a number of different sources. Advanced climate models and Klimator’s unique classification model for the road network are used in tandem to process this data and deliver detailed real-time information and predictive forecasts about road weather conditions. This information can be applied in a number of different areas in the automotive industry, including intelligent Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and complex systems for autonomous vehicles (AD). Based on RCD, Road Status Information (RSI) is a digital Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) application that provides detailed forecasts for roads, bike paths, and pedestrian walkways. These high-resolution forecasts are used by transportation agencies and winter road contractors to make critical decisions about when, where, and how to implement snow removal and de-icing measures. Klimator’s forecasts facilitate decision-making, planning, and follow-up and Ilitate more efficient use of resources, which results in significant cost savings and a lessened impact on the environment. AHEAD is a sensor technology that analyzes road conditions and friction in front of a moving vehicle in real-time. The technology is the result of more than ten years of research and development into road condition classification. AHEAD gives vehicle system information about prevailing road conditions, which improves the functionality and utility of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems and Autonomous Driving technology. Klimator’s IoT Road Weather Stations provides real-time information on how weather impacts local road conditions. This data will empower operators to make informed decisions on the appropriate treatments necessary. The data is easily accessible from the Road Status Information (RSI) platform. The data comes in the form of an API so can also be fed into other weather monitoring and forecasting systems if necessary.

Despite delayed revenue, our competitive edge in CNT pellicles has remained strong or improved. Solid operational progress was marked by customer approval of the first CNT100 SEMI reactor and post-processing equipment, now ready for mass production of CNT pellicle membranes. To drive further growth and diversification, we made the decision to double our premises, reinforced our strategic, long-term commitment to Medical Diagnostics, and recreated new business development to accelerate time-to-market for high-value applications. We are confident that Canatu’s competitive position in CNT pellicles is now significantly stronger compared to the time of our listing in 2024. Advanced chips (< 7nm features) are the fastest growing segment in the semiconductor industry, projected to grow at roughly 20% annually, with logic chips growing at 10–20% and DRAM 15–25% annually between 2025–2030. (ASML). Industry sources anticipate that advanced chip manufacturing with 600W power scanners will start by 2027. This is expected to be the inflection point for wider usage of CNT pellicles. However, we expect some usage of CNT pellicles also with 500W scanners due to their high transmission and productivity gains. Although the adoption of 600W scanners is delayed, Canatu’s competitive edge in CNT pellicles has remained strong or improved. In parallel, we are negotiating new orders with existing and prospective customers across the ecosystem. Although our fundamentals remain strong, H1 revenue did not meet our expectations. Revenue declined to EUR 7.3 million, down from EUR 11.1 million in H1 2024, representing a decrease of 34.1%. Decrease was mainly caused by semiconductor industry’s delay to adopt high-power scanners, slower-than-anticipated customer approvals (Site Acceptance Test, SAT) of CNT100 SEMI reactors—which delayed both revenue recognition and potential follow-on reactor orders from existing customers—and general market uncertainty. Gross profit was EUR 4.9 million, a decrease of 28.5%. Gross margin increased to 67.3% (62.1%) and was driven by the changes in product mix. The development of adjusted EBIT margin, -66.4% (-20.6%), was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and secondarily to the increase in headcount. Despite delayed revenue, we made strong operative progress. The first CNT100 SEMI reactor and post-processing equipment received customer approval and are now ready to start mass production of CNT pellicle membranes. Before pilot and risk mass production, the customer must secure approval for the complete coated CNT pellicle product. After successful pilot and risk production, high-volume production of CNT pellicle membranes will commence. Mass production will generate Canatu revenue from consumables and sold CNT pellicles. For the second reactor, the timeline for obtaining the customer approval (SAT) is not fully within Canatu’s control and the risk of delays cannot therefore be excluded. We remain actively engaged with both customers to support their transition toward high-volume mass production. Our market position in inspection membranes remained strong. We continued supplying membranes for EUV mask inspection, including High Numerical Aperture (High-NA).​ Building on Canatu’s track record of mass-producing inspection membranes since 2021, we received a purchase order from a long-standing, top-tier customer, reinforcing our leadership in the field. We also took significant steps in investing in long-term growth and diversification. To support increasing demand and enable future expansion, we are doubling our premises with a new facility. Located next to our headquarters and factory in Vantaa, the 3,000m² facility addresses growing operational needs, supports future scale-up, and provides additional office space for our expanding team. We reinforced our strategic, long-term commitment to Medical Diagnostics. Our focus continues to be on point-of-care in infectious diseases and hormone monitoring. In addition, we have strengthened our leadership and team capabilities with new hires, and most recently published two scientific papers. Recognizing the need for greater agility in capturing emerging opportunities, we recreated our new business development by deploying enhanced resources and a dedicated team, with the goal of systemic assessment of new high-value applications for our advanced CNT and bringing them to market faster. For example, the development work of next-generation solar panel applications aims at generating power using CNT electrodes. In another area, we are producing sensors protecting advanced electronic devices in the defense industry. These initiatives demonstrate Canatu’s ability to serve demanding, emerging applications and highlight both the versatility of our CNT technology and the reliability of our manufacturing. In March, Canatu was selected as a Leading Company (Veturi) by Business Finland and awarded up to EUR 10 million in funding to accelerate the onset of the Carbon Age. Canatu will lead the creation of an industrial ecosystem to drive innovation and growth, with total funding for partners reaching up to EUR 20M. The program also aims to standardize CNT structures and establish design and manufacturing guidelines to enable next-generation semiconductor solutions. We continued to strengthen our organization, expanding the team during H1 with a net addition of 10 employees. Canatu’s average number of employees during the review period was 132 (117) in terms of full-time employees. The number of personnel employed at the end of the review period was 147 (128). We made three key recruitments to strengthen the Management Team and support Canatu’s growth strategy. Mikko Vesterinen joined Canatu in January 2025 as Chief Financial Officer. Tapani Salminen was appointed Chief Operating Officer in April, and Nedal Safwat became Chief Development Officer and President of Canatu Inc in June, leading the Medical Diagnostics business unit. Investment in growth is set to accelerate, with a significant increase expected in the second half of the year. After the reporting period, Canatu ordered a PELMIS EUV pellicle inspection system from Lasertec to improve quality control and metrology capabilities. This investment is a key enabler for the long-term development of our CNT SEMI reactor and pellicle membrane business, strengthening our competitiveness, raising quality standards, and ensuring we meet the stringent requirements of semiconductor customers. For 2025, we expect a revenue delay due to slower-than-anticipated market deployment of high-power scanners as reflected in our updated 2025 outlook. However, we remain confident in our path forward and firmly believe that Canatu is well-positioned for sustained growth in the long-term. Backed by rapid growth of advanced chips market, Canatu is well-positioned to capture market share, with an even stronger competitive position. We are moving full speed ahead, investing in future growth through a refined Medical Diagnostics strategy, expansion into the defense industry, next-generation solar cell solutions, and other emerging opportunities. We are taking steps toward the (Nano) Carbon Age. Updated 2025 outlook Canatu sees that the company’s long-term potential in the three business focus areas—Semiconductor, Automotive, and Medical Diagnostics—has remained unchanged. Canatu expects that its revenue for the financial year 2025 will decline compared to the 2024 unaudited pro forma revenue of EUR 22 million. If no new CNT100 SEMI reactor orders are received during H2/2025, the revenue for the financial year 2025 is expected to decline significantly compared to the unaudited pro forma revenue of EUR 22 million. In accordance with its disclosure policy, Canatu does not issue any specific numerical guidance for the financial year 2025. In the near term, Canatu sees that there are certain factors, which affect the revenue visibility and may increase the volatility of the company’s revenue development, particularly in the Semiconductor and Automotive businesses. For example, the roll-out of ready CNT pellicles ultimately depends on Canatu’s customers and their processes. Further, the timeline for obtaining the second CNT100 SEMI reactor customer approval (SAT) is not fully within Canatu’s control, and the risk of delays cannot therefore be excluded. Previous 2025 outlook published on 28 March 2025 Canatu sees that the company’s long-term potential in the three business focus areas—Semiconductor, Automotive, and Medical Diagnostics—has remained unchanged. Canatu expects that its revenue for the financial year 2025 will be weighted towards the second half of the year. This is primarily driven by the anticipated timing of potential new CNT100 SEMI reactor orders and the associated revenue recognition of such orders. In the near term, Canatu sees that there are certain factors, which affect the revenue visibility and may increase the volatility of the company’s revenue development, particularly in the Semiconductor and Automotive businesses. For example, the roll-out of ready CNT pellicles ultimately depends on Canatu’s customers and their processes. In accordance with its disclosure policy, Canatu does not issue any specific numerical guidance or other financial outlook for the financial year 2025 at this point. However, the company will assess the possibility of issuing such guidance or outlook later during the financial year. Business area outlook Semiconductor outlook In the near-term, Canatu expects that royalty and consumable revenue from existing CNT100 SEMI reactor customers will depend on three key steps: (i) the customers need to complete the final Site Acceptance Tests (SAT) of the first two CNT100 SEMI reactors and related equipment Canatu shipped in 2024, of which the first was completed in H1/2025; (ii) the customers need to receive certain internal and/or external approvals for their ready CNT pellicles; and (iii) the customers need to ramp-up high-volume production of ready CNT pellicles. Since Canatu has agreed to deliver the reactors for CNT pellicle membrane production, the final timing of steps two and three and hence of such royalty and consumable revenue depends on the customers and their processes, not on Canatu. Furthermore, Canatu expects that any potential follow-on CNT100 SEMI reactor orders from existing customers will likely also be subject to the successful completion of the final SATs for the first two CNT100 SEMI reactors and peripherals Canatu shipped in 2024. The SAT of the first CNT100 SEMI reactor and related peripherals was completed in H1/2025. With regards to the second CNT100 SEMI reactor, the timeline for obtaining the customer approval (SAT) is not fully within Canatu’s control and the risk of delays cannot therefore be excluded. Canatu expects to sustain its position as a leading supplier of inspection membranes used in patterned EUV mask inspection for debris filtering in the financial year 2025. As a key priority for 2025, Canatu focuses on supporting its customers to reach the capability to launch the production of ready CNT pellicles. At the same time, Canatu continues to invest in the development of new inspection membrane products and the next-generation CNT SEMI reactors. Canatu expects that the Semiconductor business will be the largest contributor to the group’s revenue in the financial year 2025. Automotive outlook In the Automotive Business, the ramp-up of ADAS camera heater mass production has been delayed due to certain customer processes. The timing of the start of the mass production ramp-up depends on customers and their processes. In April 2025 Canatu announced a new joint development agreement (JDA) with DENSO to improve carbon nanotube performance. The JDA is expected to have a positive impact on automotive business unit’s revenue in 2025. However, any potential revenue or profit from future commercialization opportunities are subject to material uncertainties, including the outcomes of the JDA program. Medical Diagnostics outlook Medical Diagnostics is in the development stage. During H1, Canatu refined its strategy and focused on the development of point-of-care testing for infectious diseases and hormone monitoring. Canatu expects that the Medical Diagnostics business will make a non-material contribution to the 2025 financial year revenue relative to the contributions by the Semiconductor and Automotive businesses.

Kempower celebrates Denmark’s first megawatt charging station as government launches e-truck fund 4.9.2025 13:48:34 | Kempower Oyj | Press release Kempower, a global leader in DC fast charging solutions, is celebrating the Danish government’s new electric trucking subsidy programme as it announces the launch of the country’s first megawatt charging station. The Funding Scheme for the Green Transition of Heavy Transport opened on 3 September, and will see the government pledge DKK 352.5 million (approx. EUR 47 million) to support logistics companies to invest in electric trucks and charging infrastructure. Kempower collaborated with GodEnergi to deliver the first megawatt charging station in Denmark for logistics firm Danske Fragtmænd’s Odense depot. Kempower Kempower announces the launch of the country’s first megawatt charging station for trucks in collaboration with GodEnergi Danish government launches DKK 352.5 million subsidy to boost electric truck industry Logistics firms are urged to take advantage of support before deadline to fund transition towards emission free operations. The subsidy is being funded by a reallocation of biogas investments into e-mobility by the Danish government and marks a significant milestone in the country’s journey toward zero-emission heavy transport. The scheme is designed to accelerate the deployment of electric trucks and the required charging infrastructure, supporting the country’s ambitious climate goals. Denmark’s financial commitment to the logistics transition comes alongside significant technological developments in the available charging infrastructure, which will support the incoming wave of electric trucks with high power demands. Most recently, Kempower supplied Denmark’s first megawatt charging station in Odense, which will see power levels of up to 1.2 MW used to charge compatible heavy-duty e-trucks in as little as 45 minutes. Kempower collaborated with GodEnergi to deliver the ultra-high-powered infrastructure for logistics firm Danske Fragtmænd’s Odense depot, and the project marks a huge step forward for truck charging technology both in Denmark and globally. Megawatt charging technology is still in the early stages of its rollout but its potential for transforming trucking is great – the unprecedented charging speed it can deliver drastically reduced downtime and makes transitioning even long-haul fleets realistic for businesses. Denmark is a key market for Kempower, a Nordic company founded in Finland, and the site in Odense is just one of over 40 truck depots in Denmark that are equipped with Kempower’s chargers. Erik Kanerva, Director of Sales, North Europe at Kempower, said: “Denmark is setting a powerful example for Europe and the world. By investing in truck charging infrastructure, the country is not only reducing emissions but also paving the way for scalable, future-proof logistics. We’re proud to contribute to this transformation.” “We're pleased to offer our full support to organizations applying for the subsidy and would encourage applicants to reach out. Together with our local collaborators, we can provide the expert guidance, technical solutions and project support needed to ensure successful applications and impactful installations.” The Funding Scheme for the Green Transition of Heavy Transport closes on 30 September and funds are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Each company is eligible for up to DKK 4 million funding. Kempower is holding a Live Webinar about its truck charging solutions in Danish on Thursday, 11 September at 10 am Danish time.

Adjusted 2025 EBITDA guidance primarily driven by lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds Following lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds during July and August, Ørsted has adjusted its full-year 2025 EBITDA guidance excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees of DKK 24 billion to DKK 27 billion, compared to its previous guidance of DKK 25 billion to DKK 28 billion. Gross investments guidance for the full-year 2025 of DKK 50 billion to DKK 54 billion is reiterated. The primary driver for the adjustment to the EBITDA guidance is the impact from the lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across the offshore portfolio, which has had an adverse EBITDA impact of approximately DKK 1.2 billion relative to normalised wind speeds during 2025. A delay of the Greater Changhua 2b construction project will also adversely impact EBITDA in 2025 by approximately DKK 0.3 billion. The above is not expected to impact Ørsted’s medium-term targets. Proposal and strong support for conducting a rights issue At the extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders are asked to grant authorisation to the Board of Directors to issue new shares with pre-emptive rights for the existing shareholders (the ‘Rights Issue’) . The background for this proposal is the recent material adverse development in the US offshore wind market. Ørsted appreciates the support for the proposal already given by a larger group of shareholders prior to the extraordinary general meeting, including the company's majority shareholder, the Danish State. Background for proposed Rights Issue As previously communicated on 11 August 2025 ( company announcement no. 12/2025 ), the proceeds from the Rights Issue will be used to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide financial flexibility to ensure an appropriate capitalisation in the years 2025 through 2027, during which Ørsted will deliver its 8.1 GW offshore wind construction portfolio. Specifically, the Rights Issue is intended to enhance the value of Ørsted’s portfolio by: covering the incremental funding requirements from the full ownership of Sunrise Wind strengthening the capital structure to preserve and optimise the value of its operational and construction portfolio enabling a more value-accretive and flexible approach to the timing of partnerships and divestments related to offshore wind farms reinforcing Ørsted’s position as a global leader in offshore wind by increasing the company’s financial robustness and flexibility, positioning Ørsted to pursue the most value-accretive investment opportunities in core offshore wind markets in Europe and select markets in APAC going forward. Legal proceedings against stop-work order for Revolution Wind On 4 September 2025, Revolution Wind LLC, a joint venture between Ørsted and a consortium led by Skyborn Renewables (a Global Infrastructure Partners platform company), filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the stop-work order from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), to be followed by a request for a Preliminary Injunction. Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders towards a prompt resolution. Revolution Wind secured all required federal and state permits in 2023, following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Federal reviews and approvals included the U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, and several other agencies. Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon this fulsome review process. Read more in the announcement from Revolution Wind. Update on Greater Changhua 2b in Taiwan At the end of August 2025, Ørsted was informed by its supplier that the export cable at the 0.3 GW Greater Changhua 2b offshore wind project in Taiwan had been damaged. As a result, the expected commissioning of Greater Changhua 2b has been delayed from late 2025 to Q3 2026, which will lower the expected revenue from ramp-up generation during 2025. This does not affect operations at Greater Changhua 2a nor planned COD for Greater Changhua 4, and the installation of the remaining wind turbines at Greater Changhua 2b and 4 will continue as planned. Despite the delay, the process towards signing the partial divestment of Greater Changhua 2b continues as planned, with expected signing during 2025. Closing of the transaction is subject to full commissioning of Greater Changhua 2b. Continued focus on delivery of the business plan Ørsted has continued to deliver on its business plan and four strategic priorities for the past six months. The construction of 8.1 GW offshore wind projects will almost double the company’s installed capacity, and Ørsted has seen progress on its construction portfolio and achieved several milestones. Ørsted will focus its business more geographically and technologically, with a strategic focus on offshore wind in Europe, and will continue to increase its competitiveness.

Adjusted 2025 EBITDA guidance primarily driven by lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds Following lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds during July and August, Ørsted has adjusted its full-year 2025 EBITDA guidance excluding new partnerships and cancellation fees of DKK 24 billion to DKK 27 billion, compared to its previous guidance of DKK 25 billion to DKK 28 billion. Gross investments guidance for the full-year 2025 of DKK 50 billion to DKK 54 billion is reiterated. The primary driver for the adjustment to the EBITDA guidance is the impact from the lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds across the offshore portfolio, which has had an adverse EBITDA impact of approximately DKK 1.2 billion relative to normalised wind speeds during 2025. A delay of the Greater Changhua 2b construction project will also adversely impact EBITDA in 2025 by approximately DKK 0.3 billion. The above is not expected to impact Ørsted’s medium-term targets. Proposal and strong support for conducting a rights issue At the extraordinary general meeting, the shareholders are asked to grant authorisation to the Board of Directors to issue new shares with pre-emptive rights for the existing shareholders (the ‘Rights Issue’) . The background for this proposal is the recent material adverse development in the US offshore wind market. Ørsted appreciates the support for the proposal already given by a larger group of shareholders prior to the extraordinary general meeting, including the company's majority shareholder, the Danish State. Background for proposed Rights Issue As previously communicated on 11 August 2025 ( company announcement no. 12/2025 ), the proceeds from the Rights Issue will be used to strengthen Ørsted’s capital structure and provide financial flexibility to ensure an appropriate capitalisation in the years 2025 through 2027, during which Ørsted will deliver its 8.1 GW offshore wind construction portfolio. Specifically, the Rights Issue is intended to enhance the value of Ørsted’s portfolio by: covering the incremental funding requirements from the full ownership of Sunrise Wind strengthening the capital structure to preserve and optimise the value of its operational and construction portfolio enabling a more value-accretive and flexible approach to the timing of partnerships and divestments related to offshore wind farms reinforcing Ørsted’s position as a global leader in offshore wind by increasing the company’s financial robustness and flexibility, positioning Ørsted to pursue the most value-accretive investment opportunities in core offshore wind markets in Europe and select markets in APAC going forward. Legal proceedings against stop-work order for Revolution Wind On 4 September 2025, Revolution Wind LLC, a joint venture between Ørsted and a consortium led by Skyborn Renewables (a Global Infrastructure Partners platform company), filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, challenging the stop-work order from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), to be followed by a request for a Preliminary Injunction. Revolution Wind will continue to seek to work collaboratively with the US Administration and other stakeholders towards a prompt resolution. Revolution Wind secured all required federal and state permits in 2023, following reviews that began more than nine years ago. Federal reviews and approvals included the U.S. Department of Defence, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Marine Fisheries Service, and several other agencies. Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon this fulsome review process. Read more in the announcement from Revolution Wind. Update on Greater Changhua 2b in Taiwan At the end of August 2025, Ørsted was informed by its supplier that the export cable at the 0.3 GW Greater Changhua 2b offshore wind project in Taiwan had been damaged. As a result, the expected commissioning of Greater Changhua 2b has been delayed from late 2025 to Q3 2026, which will lower the expected revenue from ramp-up generation during 2025. This does not affect operations at Greater Changhua 2a nor planned COD for Greater Changhua 4, and the installation of the remaining wind turbines at Greater Changhua 2b and 4 will continue as planned. Despite the delay, the process towards signing the partial divestment of Greater Changhua 2b continues as planned, with expected signing during 2025. Closing of the transaction is subject to full commissioning of Greater Changhua 2b. Continued focus on delivery of the business plan Ørsted has continued to deliver on its business plan and four strategic priorities for the past six months. The construction of 8.1 GW offshore wind projects will almost double the company’s installed capacity, and Ørsted has seen progress on its construction portfolio and achieved several milestones. Ørsted will focus its business more geographically and technologically, with a strategic focus on offshore wind in Europe, and will continue to increase its competitiveness.

The decision requires Ojos del Salado to implement remediation activities on the impacted area, including but not limited to the backfilling of the sinkhole, the facilitation of recharging the aquifer, ongoing monitoring requirements and the transfer of certain ground water rights. In addition, Ojos del Salado is required to implement water infrastructure projects to strengthen rural potable water and wastewater systems in communities surrounding the mine. Throughout the process the Company has collaborated with investigative proceedings initiated by sectoral regulators, including providing monitoring technology, studies and experts to provide information and ensure the stability of the sinkhole. The Company will work with authorities and stakeholders to clarify details and timelines of the remediation activities included in the decision while it determines its next steps. Mining operations at Alcaparrosa have been suspended since the sinkhole incident occurred in July 2022. At the time, Mineral Reserve estimates for the Alcaparrosa mine were removed from the Company’s reserve statement and have not been included in any future production estimates. The Company’s Candelaria operation is unaffected and is forecast to produce 140,000 tonnes to 150,000 tonnes of copper in 2025. The information in this release is subject to the disclosure requirements of Lundin Mining under the Swedish Financial Instruments Trading Act.

Through Grahns, Humble intends to invest approximately SEK 135 million in machinery and adaptations of the Facility’s infrastructure (the “Investment”). The Investment will be carried out in two phases, with the first phase starting immediately, and production at the Facility is expected to begin in summer 2026. At full capacity, the increased production is expected to generate approximately SEK 300 million in net sales and SEK 60 million in EBITDA annually. The Investment Through Grahns, Humble intends to invest approximately SEK 135 million in machinery and infrastructure upgrades. The Investment will be carried out in two phases: Phase 1: Approximately SEK 100 million will be invested in a new production line, including kitchen and cooking equipment, drying cabinets, and packaging machines. About SEK 60 million of this is expected to be allocated during the third and fourth quarters of 2025, with the remaining SEK 40 million planned for the first half of 2026. Phase 2: Additional machinery will be added to fully realize the capacity of the new production line. This phase is expected to take place in 2028 and amount to approximately SEK 35 million. The lease agreement and the Investment form an important part of Humble’s overall strategy to increase the capacity of its industrial platform and create favorable conditions to continue driving organic and profitable growth. “ We see rapidly growing demand for confectionery products among our own brands and distribution companies. In addition, the market is developing positively, with incoming requests for contract manufacturing far exceeding our available capacity from external customers – both in Sweden and for export. The Investment enables us to scale up capacity with greater efficiency and is expected to generate stable returns on invested capital. ” says Simon Petrén, CEO, Humble Group AB. Doubled Volume and Strengthened Profitability Through the Facility, Grahns expects to at least double its production volume of soft confectionery products, particularly jelly, where demand is highest. At full utilization of the Facility, Grahns is expected to produce approximately 11,000 tons of jelly per year. The increased capacity is expected to generate around SEK 300 million in additional sales and approximately SEK 60 million in improved EBITDA annually. “ With the Investment, we are taking another step towards becoming a leading confectionery manufacturer in Sweden. We are strengthening our overall capacity and creating the conditions to scale up sugar-reduced candy products faster, without compromising Grahns’ classic candy favorites. The economies of scale within the central organization increase our competitiveness and enable us to improve profitability going forward. ” says Jesper Lööw, CEO, Grahns Konfektyr AB. Timeline The production facility is expected to be completed and operational in the summer of 2026. The financial impact of the Investment is expected to be realized gradually from the second half of 2026, reaching full effect within approximately four years. The Facility The Facility is owned by S tenhus, which has leased the premises to Rockwool. The Facility has a total area of approximately 15,000 square meters, of which around 12,000 square meters are production and warehouse space. The agreement has been entered into on favorable terms during the initial lease period and in connection with the takeover of the lease, Rockwool will transfer certain machinery and equipment in the factory to Grahns free of charge.

PLEASE SEE IMPORTANT INFORMATION AT THE END OF THIS PRESS RELEASE. MEDS Apotek AB (publ) ( "" MEDS "" or the "" Company "" ), a full-scale online pharmacy serving the Swedish outpatient market, today announces its intention to launch an initial public offering of shares (the "" Offering "" ) and to list the Company’s shares on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market (together with the Offering, the "" Listing "" ). The Offering is expected to consist of both new and existing shares in the Company. MEDS’ Board of Directors deems a listing of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth market to be a natural and important step in the Company’s development. The Board of Directors believes the Listing will provide the Company access to both the Swedish and international capital markets and, in the long-term, broaden the shareholder base, supporting the Company’s continued profitable growth and development. The Listing will further strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and increase the financial flexibility for potential future investments. Nasdaq Stockholm AB has assessed that MEDS fulfils the current listing requirements at Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market. Nasdaq Stockholm AB will approve an application for admission to trading of the Company’s shares on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market, provided that certain customary conditions are met. Depending on market conditions, the Listing is expected to be completed during the third quarter of 2025. Björn Thorngren, CEO and founder of MEDS, comments: ""MEDS has, since its launch in 2018, built a highly appreciated Swedish online pharmacy, with nearly one million returning customers and a turnover exceeding SEK 1 billion on an annualised basis. Following significant initial investments, the company has been cash flow positive over the past twelve months while continuing to grow substantially faster than the market. Everything is in place to maintain a strong growth rate with solid and increasing profitability."", says Björn Thorngren, CEO and founder of MEDS, and continues: ""The strong position would not have been possible without satisfied customers, who therefore return to a high degree. It is important to remember that, despite doubling our market share over the past four years, we still only hold 6 percent in a market that is steadily growing, with more and more customers transitioning to shopping online."" Christian W. Jansson, Chairman of the Board of MEDS, comments: ""Björn and his team have demonstrated their ability to deliver on their promises. They have built an online pharmacy from the ground up that customers truly appreciate and return to. The business today is structured to enable rapid growth with increasing profitability, as it has significant economies of scale, without the need for substantial investments in the foreseeable future."", says Christian W. Jansson, Chairman of the Board of MEDS. The Offering in brief and prospectus Should the Company proceed with the Listing, the Offering will be directed to the general public in Sweden and institutional investors in Sweden and abroad, outside the US pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Offering will consist of new and existing shares in the Company. MEDS intends to use the net issue proceeds from the Offering to strengthen its balance sheet and increase the financial flexibility for potential future investments. Ahlström Invest B.V., Cicero Fonder, Lancelot Asset Management, Lupus alpha Asset Management AG, Swedbank Robur and TIND Asset Management (together the "" Cornerstone Investors "" ) have, under certain customary conditions, undertaken to acquire shares in the Offering totalling an amount of approximately SEK 150 million at a pre-money market value of the Company of up to approximately SEK 914 million. Complete terms, conditions and instructions for the Offering will be described in a prospectus prepared by the Company in connection with the intended Offering. The prospectus will, if published, be available on MEDS’ website, . About MEDS MEDS, launched in 2018, is a full-scale online pharmacy operating in the Swedish outpatient market. The Company offers its customers an extensive product range at attractive prices. The Company is licensed by the Swedish Medical Products Agency, the National Food Agency, and the eHealth Agency, and offers its customers prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and a wide selection of commercial goods such as beauty products, dietary supplements, children's products, fitness products, food and drinks, and home & household products. As of 30 June 2025, the Company had approximately 960,000 active customers[1] and always strives to deliver goods directly, quickly and reliably. MEDS experienced a net sales growth of 27% in 2024, and the Company's net sales for the last twelve months as of 30 June 2025 amounted to approximately SEK 928 million. The Company has been profitable at an adjusted EBIT level since Q4 2024, where MEDS during H1 2025 achieved an adjusted EBIT margin of 2.0 per cent. The Company's headquarters is located in Stockholm, and per 30 June 2025, the number of employees was 51. MEDS believes it possesses several strengths and competitive advantages that help the Company implement its strategy and achieve its financial targets, including: MEDS has an attractive product offering and high customer satisfaction. To achieve its goal of becoming Sweden's favourite pharmacy, MEDS offers its customers a simple and fast shopping experience, along with a wide product range, attractive prices and qualified advice; The Company is increasing its market share in the fastest growing sector within Swedish e-commerce. MEDS operates in the fastest-growing sector of Swedish e-commerce and has nearly doubled its market share in the Swedish e-commerce market for outpatient care products from 2020 to 2024; Relatively low online penetration in a sector well-suited for e-commerce supports continued significant growth potential. Despite the strong growth rate in recent years, the e-commerce penetration remains relatively low compared to other sectors. The Company therefore believes there is significant room for continued strong growth in online sales within the outpatient care market going forward; The Company has a growing base of active existing customers which contributes to increased revenue predictability and potential for improved profitability. High customer satisfaction ensures customer loyalty, resulting in an increased share of active existing customers. A higher share of active existing customers also leads to lower customer acquisition costs and improved profitability; and MEDS has an experienced management team consisting of founders and experts, as well as a strong corporate culture. MEDS has a management team characterised by a broad mix of competencies highly relevant to the continued development of MEDS’s operations. The management team and Board of Directors have extensive experience from a variety of industries: the pharmacy and healthcare market, retail, audit and consultancy firms, tech companies, marketing, logistics and finance. To continue the Company’s high and sustainable growth, MEDS has developed strategic initiatives that mainly include the four components marketing, increased share of prescription drugs sales, products under private label and a continued streamlined cost structure. From a long-term perspective the goal is, with the help of the Company’s main growth initiatives, to be the customers’ favourite pharmacy.

Information to distributors Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments, as amended ("" MiFID II ""); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together, the "" MiFID II Product Governance Requirements ""), and disclaiming all and any liability, whether arising in tort, contract or otherwise, which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto, the Company's securities have been subject to a product approval process, which has determined that such securities are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors who meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the "" EU Target Market Assessment ""). Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process in the United Kingdom, the target market assessment in respect of the securities in the Company has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ("" UK MiFIR ""); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate (the "" UK Target Market Assessment "" and, together with the EU Target Market Assessment, the "" Target Market Assessment "").

The Target Market Assessment is without prejudice to the requirements of any contractual, legal or regulatory selling restrictions in relation to the Offering and the Listing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Target Market Assessment does not constitute: (a) an assessment of suitability or appropriateness for the purposes of MiFID II or UK MiFIR; or (b) a recommendation to any investor or group of investors to invest in, or purchase, or take any other action whatsoever with respect to the Company's securities.

Company description HLRE Holding Group (commonly known as Vesivek Group) is a leading provider of roof and roof product renovations, primarily offered to detached and row houses in Finland and Sweden under the Vesivek brand. In addition to roof and roof product installations, Vesivek provides underground drain renovations in eight locations in Finland. The Group also develops, manufactures, and sells high quality rainwater systems and roof safety products. HLRE Holding Group operates in 13 locations in Finland and three locations in Sweden and employing an average of approximately 700 employees. The Group has two production facilities in Finland, steel roofing profile production in Pirkkala and the production of rainwater systems and roof safety products in Orimattila. Management Overview of the second quarter The Group's revenue and gross profit improved in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Especially in Sweden the roof installation business performed very well. Revenue increase was 22% and gross profit increase 57%. In Finland roof installation and roof product sales grew compared to last year. Gross profit remained at previous year level due to the sales mix where sales were more focused on non-consumer projects with lower profitability. However, investments in revenue growth were reflected in increased fixed personnel costs and other fixed operating expenses. Due to that reason the adjusted EBITDA with EUR 0.6 million remained at previous year level. Despite revenue growth, sales volumes remained low in the second quarter, especially in the Finnish business areas. Q2 results fell short of our forecast. The Group has started negotiations in August to reduce fixed personnel costs in order to improve profitability towards the year end. Second quarter May - July 20245 Q2 revenue increased by 7 % to EUR 27.0 million (25.1 million). Revenue grew especially in roof installation business in Sweden. Gross profit was EUR 9.8 million (9.2 million). Q2 reported EBITDA was EUR 1.0 million (0.8 million) and adjusted EBITDA EUR 0.6 million (0.6 million). Despite the growth in revenue and gross profit, the adjusted EBITDA remained at previous year level due to higher fixed personnel and administrative expenses. The reported one-off items for Q2 May – July 2025 concern received capital gains from sold tangible assets (vehicles) amounted to EUR 0.4 million. Q2 operating cash flow was EUR 0.7 million (0.5 million). Cash flow increased due to the positive changes in working capital and lower net financial items. The change in cash and cash equivalents was EUR -0.1 million. First half 2025 H1 revenue increased by 7 % to EUR 48.8 EUR million (EUR 45.7 million). H1 gross profit increased to EUR 18.4 million (EUR 17.7 million). Revenue and gross profit grew especially in roof installation business in Sweden. H1 reported EBITDA decreased to EUR 0.8 million (1.1 million) and adjusted EBITDA to EUR 0.4 million (0.9 million). Reported adjustments in H1 amounted to EUR 0.4 and mainly concerned received capital gains from sold tangible assets (vehicles). H1 net cash from operating activities was EUR 1.2 million (EUR -2.6 million). Cash flow increased due to the positive changes in working capital, lower net financial items and lower paid taxes. The change in cash and cash equivalents was EUR -1.2 million due to the payments of lease liabilities and other borrowings. Outlook for the financial year 1 February 2025 – 31 January 2026 Market growth expectations for the installation business in Sweden are strong, and we expect growth in Swedish business to continue in the second half of the year. In Finland, on the contrary, market growth expectations will remain low. The Group has started negotiations in August to reduce fixed personnel costs in order to improve profitability towards the year end in Finnish roof installation business. We expect that the EBITDA will increase in H2 compared to the previous year level mainly due to the business growth in Sweden and cost saving operations in Finland. Risks and business continuity The Half Year Financial Report for the period of February 25 – July 25 has been prepared based on the going concern principle, assuming that the Company will have positive operating cash flow sufficient to meet it’s obligations as part of normal business operations in the foreseeable future. The Group's revenue and operating profit are affected by the general economic situation, which in turn is influenced by many factors beyond the Group's control. The Group currently operates in Finland and Sweden. Currently, most of the Group's operations are located in Finland. Accordingly, the Group's revenue and operating profit are particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and perceptions of future general economic situation in the Finnish and Swedish markets. Uncertainty or adverse developments in the general economic situation may affect the Group's business and demand for the Group's products and services, among other things, by affecting consumer confidence and adversely affecting the business of the Group's corporate customers who purchase the Group's rainwater systems and roof safety products. It is important to note that the general economic situation may adversely affect the level and cost of financing available to the Group's consumer and corporate clients to make investments in renovations and refurbishments. In addition, rising financing costs and a decrease in the level of available financing may adversely affect the Group's ability to make investments and achieve its strategic objectives, as well as adversely effect on the Group's business, financial position and results. Through its manufacturing operations, the Group is furthermore exposed to fluctuations in certain commodity prices (such as steel, aluminum and wood) and energy prices (especially through fuel costs for vehicles) and price increases due to economic disruptions and changes in general market conditions may adversely affect the Group's business, financial position and results. All the above factors may harm the Group's operations, and the Group cannot anticipate how the future economic environment and market conditions may affect the Group's operations. In general, the frequency of accidents at construction sites is noteworthy and the Group operates in a business segment subject to extensive laws and regulations regarding the work environment. Despite the required health and safety measures and, for example, the use of scaffolding to improve employee safety on construction sites, the Group is exposed to potentially fatal accidents at workplaces, particularly on roofing renovation sites, but also at its production facilities. In addition to physical injuries, the Group’s employees are exposed to risks related to hazardous substances, as some of the Group’s renovation sites contain asbestos. Respectively, the Group must also comply with specific environmental regulations with respect to asbestos. Finnish legislation has particularly strict requirements for any activities involving asbestos and the safety requirements for such activities. Failure to comply with the regulations concerning health and safety or asbestos related activities may result in liability for the Group and/or the Group’s permit being revoked. For example, if Group’s permit to handle asbestos would be revoked, the Group would need to stop all business activities relating to handling of asbestos and acquire the work through subcontractors. In addition, any potential accidents and health impacts adversely affect employee well-being. The Group as an employer is exposed to risks related to health and safety issues of its employees, which may lead to a decrease in employees’ ability to work. The Group’s management has prepared financial forecasts for revenue, expenses and investments, taking into account the refinancing of the bond and extensive efficiency measures. In assessing the going concern assumption, management believes that the company’s current liquid funds and projected operating cash flows will be sufficient to cover its liabilities and obligations arising from its operations for at least 12 months, so the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The forecasts assume a positive turn in the markets. In addition, the Group’s management has taken measures to improve the cash position by, for example, switching to the use of consignment stock for steel products. Due to general economic uncertainty, industry cyclicality, and the short time horizon of the order book, forecasting involves a higher degree of judgment than usual. If the business does not develop as forecasted, there is a risk of liquidity being compromised and covenants being breached, which may raise significant doubts about the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. Such factors would also affect the valuation of Group’s goodwill and the shares and receivables of the parent company’s subsidiaries at the balance sheet. The Finnish roof renovation and roof product installation business has not performed as planned in the first half year and EBITDA level has been lower than estimated. Finnish economy has not recovered as estimated in the beginning of the year. The Group went through the change negotiations in August, which resulted in a decrease of 70 person. Delays in recovery in Finnish roof renovation business will increase the risk that the Group will not meet covenant requirements at the end of the year 2025. The Group’s saving measures in August should improve financial results in the third quarter. The management will follow on monthly basis the business recovery and will prepare impairment tests in Q3 if saving measures are not efficient enough to convert Finnish roof renovation business performance.

for the Group, which consists of a Finnish public limited company operating under Finnish law, with business ID 2611405-7 (hereinafter “HLRE Holding”, “Company”, or “parent company”) and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to as “HLRE”, “HLRE Group” or “Group”. The parent company’s domicile is Pirkkala, and its registered address is Jasperintie 273, FI-33960 Pirkkala, Finland. 2) Basis of preparation These consolidated Interim Financial Statements do not include all of the information required for a complete set of financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS and accordingly, selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an understanding of the changes in the Group’s financial position and performance since the last annual financial statements. The accounting policies applied are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended January 31, 2025. The consolidated financial statements are presented as thousands of euros, unless otherwise specified, and the numbers are rounded off to the nearest thousand. Because of this, the sum of individual figures can deviate from the reported total. The company’s auditors have not reviewed this Interim Report. The management has assessed the Company's ability to continue its operations as a going concern for the foreseeable future. In making this assessment, the Company's management has prepared forecasts for revenues, operating costs, and investments for the next twelve months. The forecasts are based on the assumption that the structural reorganization carried out in Finland in 2024 and continuing in 2025 has aligned the organization with demand. As of 31 July 2025, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 1.3 million. The management believes that the current cash balance is adequate to cover the Company's operational costs and investment plans for the next twelve months. Looking ahead, the Company anticipates the improved profitability and cash flow for the next quarter. Despite the inherent uncertainties, the management remains confident in the Company's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on opportunities. Taking into account the aforementioned factors and considerations, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The management will continue to closely monitor the Company's financial performance and adapt its strategies as necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and growth. 3) Seasonality of operations The Group operates in an industry that sees major seasonal changes. In a typical year, the second and third quarter together amount major share of the Group’s full-year EBITDA. Management has reacted to seasonal changes in customer volumes and demand for roof, roof product and underground drain renovations through workforce adjustment and structural changes in business area management and sales functions in Finland. 4) Segment information and revenue The Board of Directors of HLRE Holding is the Group’s chief operating decision maker, and operating segments have been specified based on the information reviewed by the Board of Directors in order to allocate resources and assess the profitability of business operations. The Board of Directors manages the HLRE Group as a single integrated business aggregate, and therefore HLRE has a single operating and reportable segment. The revenue of the HLRE Holding Group is primarily generated by roofing, roof product and underground drain renovations for single-family homes and housing companies pursuant to the service concept developed by the Company, as well as project and direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products. The entire service chain – product development, manufacturing, sales and installation – is managed in-house by the Group. The HLRE Holding Group is operating in Finland and Sweden. Small-scale out of total H1 revenue was generated by direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products from Vesivek Tuotteet Oy in Finland to Baltic countries and Sweden. The Swedish turnover was generated by roofing and roof product installations and small-scale by direct sales of rainwater systems and roof safety products: Breakdown of revenue by country 1000 EUR Feb 25 – Jul 25 H1 Feb 24 – Jul 24 H1 Feb 24 – Jan 25 Q1-Q4 Finland 37 439 36 012 81 539 Sweden 11 023 9 381 20 797 Baltic countries 375 267 593 Total 48 837 45 660 102 929 5) Financial liabilities The Group announced in January 2024 that it had concluded the negotiations with the majority holder of the bond on the terms and conditions for refinancing the bond, while at the same time announcing that, as the maturity of the outstanding bonds, being 12 February 2024, was approaching, it will request for a one-month extension to finalize the terms and conditions. On 5 February 2024, the Group announced that the majority of the bondholders had approved the one-month extension. In February 2024, the Group continued to finalize the terms and conditions of the bond, announcing on 8 March 2024 the refinancing of the three-year SEK 300 million bond and the registration of the bond with Nasdaq Stockholm on 13 March 2024. The bond falls due for payment on 12 February 2027. The terms and conditions include an interest premium of 7.85% for the deferral of the payment dates between 12 February 2024 and 12 May 2025 until the loan maturity date. The updated terms and conditions also include the option after 12 May 2025 to postpone 30% of the 7.85% interest premium until the loan maturity date. The Group used the option and postponed 30 % of the interest premium during 12 May 2025 – 12 August 2025. In addition, the terms and conditions of the bond included a five-year convertible bond of EUR 3 million issued by the Company’s principal shareholders and around EUR 66 thousand to minor shareholders. The principal of the convertible bond is subject to a fixed annual interest rate of 8.00%. The accrued interest shall be paid on the maturity date of the loan or on the conversion date specified separately in the agreement, whichever earlier. Until then, all accrued interest will remain as debt, but the accrued interest will not be added to the loan principal and will not accrue interest. The updated terms and conditions of the bond do not include the net debt/EBITDA covenant until 2025 July. After that, the covenant will be 5.0 until January 2026, 4.5 between February 2026 and July 2026, and 4.0 from August 2026 until the loan maturity date in February 2027. The updated terms and conditions also include a liquidity covenant of EUR 2 million.

Furthermore, the following internal loans have been pledged as collateral for the bond agreement: Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to HLRE Group Ltd amounted to EUR 19,696,333 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Vesivek Ltd amounted to EUR 1,234,960 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Nesco Invest Ltd amounted to EUR 8,446.710 Loan granted by HLRE Holding Ltd to Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd amounted to EUR 4,510,442 The following business mortgages have been confirmed and pledged as collateral for the bond and overdraft facility: HLRE Group Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Nesco Invest Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, amounted to EUR 57 200 000 Vesivek Sverige AB amounted to SEK 20 000 000 The following real estate mortgages have been pledged as collateral for the bond and overdraft facility: Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, Orimattila production plant, amounted to EUR 13 673 208. 7) Use of Alternative Performance Measures Alternative Performance Measures (APM) are financial measures of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than financial measures defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework. HLRE Group reports the financial measures [Gross profit], [Gross margin] and [Adjusted EBITDA] in its quarterly reports, which are not financial measures as defined in IFRS. The Group believes that the alternative performance measures provide significant additional information on HLRE’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows The APMs are used consistently over time and accompanied by comparatives for the previous periods. Gross profit= Revenues – cost of goods sold Gross margin (%) = Gross profit in relation to Revenue EBITDA = Operating profit (EBIT) + Depreciation + Amortization EBITDA % = EBITDA in relation to Revenue Adjusted EBITDA = EBITDA - EBITDA Adjustments Adjusted EBITDA % = (EBITDA - EBITDA Adjustments) / Revenue Operating profit (EBIT) % = Operating profit in relation to Revenue EBITDA adjustments = One-offs regarding restructuring costs and other non-recurring costs 8) Events after the Reporting Date The Group announced in August (4.8.2025) that it will restructure its organization and operational processes and will initiate change negotiations. In addition to changes in operating practices, the aim of the negotiations is to reduce management layers and enhance the efficiency of the sales organizations in Finland. The negotiations took place in August, started on 11 August 2025 and ended on 18 August 2025, and concerned all personnel of HLRE Group Ltd, Vesivek Ltd, and Vesivek Salaojat Ltd, excluding installers and foremen. Vesivek Tuotteet Ltd, Tuusulan Peltikeskus Ltd, and Vesivek Sverige AB were entirely excluded from the change negotiations. As a result of the change negotiations, the number of personnel will decrease by 60 employees. Together with other changes in personnel in August, the amount of employees will decrease by 71 employees from July 2025 head count. The personnel changes are estimated to generate annual savings of EUR 5.0 million. The estimated one-off expenses from the change negotiations is estimated to be EUR 0.4 million and the expenses will be booked in the Q3 Interim Report.

The Composite product group generated revenue growth, while the FOC product group’s revenue declined. Operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items for Q1-Q3 2024/25 was DKKm 43.7 (DKKm 25.8) 1 and operating profit (EBIT) before special items was DKKm 33.3 (DKKm 13.7). Both revenue and earnings were realised at the upper end of the previously guided range for the first nine months of 2024/25. The improved earnings were due to a favourable product mix and realised productivity enhancements resulting from investments in production and ongoing optimisation of operations. For Q1-Q3 2024/25, the Group posted a profit from continuing operations before tax of DKKm 28.7 (DKKm 12.9). In Company Announcement no. 8 dated 24 July 2025, the Company stated that the divestment of Roblon’s US subsidiary had been completed. The effects of this on Roblon’s interim financial statements for the first nine months are as follows: A loss of DKKm 33.1 was recognised in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period, DKKm 5.4 of which related to advisory fees. An accumulated translation reserve of DKKm -10.2 concerning the divested US subsidiary was reclassified from equity and recognised as a loss in profit/loss from discontinued operations for the period. Roblon’s receivable from the divested US subsidiary was written down from approx. USDm 12.5 to USDm 5.2 and included in Roblon’s non-current receivable in the amount of DKKm 33.7 at 31 July 2025. Roblon has retained ownership of one share with special dividend rights in the divested US subsidiary. The value of the share is recognised at DKKm 0 in Roblon’s balance sheet at 31 July 2025. At 31 July 2025, consolidated equity was reduced to DKKm 176.6 and the solvency ratio was reduced by 3.4 percentage points to 71.6% due to the value adjustment of the US subsidiary following the divestment. Roblon has no further liquidity obligations towards the divested US subsidiary. Guidance for 2024/25 Management’s previously announced guidance was that the Company’s revenue and earnings for Q4 would be at a lower level than in Q4 2023/24. This guidance is maintained, based on the lower order book at 31 July 2025 compared with 31 July 2024. Management maintains its most recent full-year guidance announced in Roblon’s interim report for H1 2024/25, although the guided ranges are narrowed as follows: revenue in the range of DKKm 230-250 against the previously guided range of DKKm 220-250 operating profit before depreciation, amortisation and impairment (EBITDA) and before special items in the range of DKKm 45-50 against the previously guided range of DKKm 40-50 operating profit (EBIT) before special items in the range of DKKm 31-36 against the previously guided range of DKKm 26-36 1 In the interim report, realised amounts for the previous year are stated in brackets.

One of the key objectives of the company’s strategy for the period 2024–2026 is to enhance the efficiency of our customer focus in operations and sales. During the strategy period, we have implemented reforms to our product development processes, drawing on the principles of continuous improvement. To further accelerate its ongoing transformation journey, Revenio is planning a restructuring of some of its operations globally. Revenio will review the adoption of a revised Product Operating Model (POM) that strengthens customer centricity and agile collaboration. The POM is a framework that organizes teams, processes, and systems around products to better deliver customer value and drive business. This would support the organization’s focus on product development and management with the principle of continuous agile development. The proposed change to the organizational model would support the implementation of Revenio Group’s corporate strategy and further strengthen the organization’s customer centricity. ""Our profitability is among the strongest in our industry. Our continued profitable growth is based on our state-of-the-art products and solutions. The goal of this change is to ensure that our organization is fit for purpose to deliver our long-term strategic goals. Globally, our operating environment is changing faster than ever before, and continued success in the market requires increasingly customer-focused operations. Our goals are to continue to be a pioneer in our industry and the best workplace for professionals in our industry. With the renewed product operating model, we would ensure that we are developing solutions for customer needs, allocating our resources correctly, and making decisions quickly and transparently. In this way, we will also continue to build a sustainable competitive advantage in the future,"" says Revenio Group’s CEO Jouni Toijala. The proposed changes may affect roles and the number of positions in some of Revenio’s units globally. As part of the planned reorganization, changes may also occur within Revenio’s Finnish organization. Therefore, in Finland, Revenio is initiating co-operation negotiations. The personnel impact of the change negotiations is estimated to be minor. The change negotiations or the planned organizational restructuring will not affect Revenio’s financial guidance for the current year. The cornerstones of Revenio Group’s strategy period 2024–2026 are: Improving the quality of clinical diagnostics with targeted product innovations Optimizing clinical care pathways with connected and predictive solutions Enhancing customer focus in operations and sales Continuing the development of the People & Culture as a foundational strength Continuing sustainable and profitable growth Further information CEO Jouni Toijala, tel. +358 50 484 0085 Distribution Main media Revenio Group in brief Revenio is a global provider of comprehensive eye care diagnostic solutions.

One of the key objectives of the company’s strategy for the period 2024–2026 is to enhance the efficiency of our customer focus in operations and sales. During the strategy period, we have implemented reforms to our product development processes, drawing on the principles of continuous improvement. To further accelerate its ongoing transformation journey, Revenio is planning a restructuring of some of its operations globally. Revenio will review the adoption of a revised Product Operating Model (POM) that strengthens customer centricity and agile collaboration. The POM is a framework that organizes teams, processes, and systems around products to better deliver customer value and drive business. This would support the organization’s focus on product development and management with the principle of continuous agile development. The proposed change to the organizational model would support the implementation of Revenio Group’s corporate strategy and further strengthen the organization’s customer centricity. ""Our profitability is among the strongest in our industry. Our continued profitable growth is based on our state-of-the-art products and solutions. The goal of this change is to ensure that our organization is fit for purpose to deliver our long-term strategic goals. Globally, our operating environment is changing faster than ever before, and continued success in the market requires increasingly customer-focused operations. Our goals are to continue to be a pioneer in our industry and the best workplace for professionals in our industry. With the renewed product operating model, we would ensure that we are developing solutions for customer needs, allocating our resources correctly, and making decisions quickly and transparently. In this way, we will also continue to build a sustainable competitive advantage in the future,"" says Revenio Group’s CEO Jouni Toijala. The proposed changes may affect roles and the number of positions in some of Revenio’s units globally. As part of the planned reorganization, changes may also occur within Revenio’s Finnish organization. Therefore, in Finland, Revenio is initiating co-operation negotiations. The personnel impact of the change negotiations is estimated to be minor. The change negotiations or the planned organizational restructuring will not affect Revenio’s financial guidance for the current year. The cornerstones of Revenio Group’s strategy period 2024–2026 are: Improving the quality of clinical diagnostics with targeted product innovations Optimizing clinical care pathways with connected and predictive solutions Enhancing customer focus in operations and sales Continuing the development of the People & Culture as a foundational strength Continuing sustainable and profitable growth Further information CEO Jouni Toijala, tel. +358 50 484 0085 Distribution Main media Revenio Group in brief Revenio is a global provider of comprehensive eye care diagnostic solutions.

Although elevated geopolitical risks increase customers’ need to invest in preparedness, they have also slowed down customers’ decision-making, especially regarding larger orders. Additionally, the Kuwait soil remediation project has progressed more slowly than anticipated. Regarding profitability, the company maintains its previous guidance. On 31 July 2025, the company announced it would accelerate efficiency measures aimed at achieving annual cost savings of EUR 8 million by the end of 2026 compared to the 2024 level. Improved margins and strategic efficiency initiatives will support profitability growth. New guidance for 2025 Revenue is expected to decrease compared to the previous year (2024: EUR 114.4 million). Adjusted operating profit is expected to increase compared to the previous year (2024: EUR 6.4 million). Updated assumptions The guidance is based on the existing order backlog, known tenders and offers submitted, and the management's view on market demand and customer decision-making timeline. The company is currently negotiating several significant equipment sales and medium-sized service contracts in all its market areas. Revenue is expected to be clearly below the comparison period during the third quarter of the year and exceed it clearly during the final quarter. Full year revenue will depend on the accumulation of new orders and delivery schedules during the rest of the year. Revenue from the continuing large service project in Kuwait is expected to be clearly lower compared to the previous year, while the growth of other revenue outside of large service projects is expected to continue. For plastic recycling no revenue is expected during 2025. The company estimates that improved margins and strategic efficiency initiatives will support profitability growth.

Lundbeck A/S (Lundbeck) and Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Inc., (Otsuka) announce that Otsuka has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for use of REXULTI® (brexpiprazole) in combination with sertraline as a treatment of adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The CRL states that the FDA has completed their review but cannot approve the application in the current form, as the application does not provide substantial evidence of effectiveness to support the approval. The sNDA for brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline for the treatment of adults with PTSD was accepted for review by the FDA in June 2024 and was based on data from three randomized clinical trials that evaluated the safety and efficacy of brexpiprazole in combination with sertraline in adult patients with PTSD. The FDA decision follows the Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee Meeting on July 18, 2025. The committee voted 1-10 determining that the efficacy of brexpiprazole, when initiated concurrently with sertraline, has not been established for the treatment of PTSD based on the available data presented. Although data from three clinical studies were submitted, the FDA stated in the CRL that not all of these studies are capable of contributing to the substantial evidence of the submission and should Otsuka and Lundbeck be interested in proceeding with the indication, additional positive, adequate and well-controlled trials would be needed to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness. “While we respect the FDA’s decision, we continue to believe in the potential of REXULTI in combination with sertraline to help address this serious unmet need,” said John Kraus, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Otsuka. “Otsuka and Lundbeck will take time to review the contents of the letter with the FDA to determine the appropriate path forward.” Johan Luthman, executive vice president of Lundbeck Research & Development, commented. “Post-traumatic stress disorder places a significant and often overlooked burden on patients, their families, and society. We are grateful to the participants, their families, the clinical trial site investigators and staff, and the entire program team for their dedication and commitment to advancing care for those living with PTSD.” This Corporate Release contains inside information and is disclosed in accordance with Article 17 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU, no. 596/2014). About Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder PTSD is one of the most common mental health disorders in the United States, with approximately five percent of the population affected during a given year.i, ii, iii, iv Most patients (>80%) with PTSD in the United States are in the civilian population. v, vi It may occur in people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, series of events or set of circumstances. An individual may experience an event that is emotionally or physically harmful or life-threatening and which may affect mental, physical, social, and/or spiritual well-being. Examples of traumatic events include physical/sexual assault, serious accidents, war/combat, natural disasters, terrorist acts, historical trauma, intimate partner violence and bullying.vii, viii Symptoms of PTSD are generally grouped into four symptom clusters: intrusion (re-experiencing), avoidance, negative cognitions and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity.ix Individual symptom type and intensity can fluctuate over time and between individuals. The average time from index trauma to symptom presentation is typically 2.2 years, and the average time from index trauma to PTSD diagnosis is typically 8.7 years. To meet the criteria for PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must last longer than one month, and they must be severe enough to interfere with aspects of daily life, such as relationships or work. Symptoms also must not be due to medications, substance use, or another medical condition. Guideline-recommended first-line treatment includes psychotherapy (e.g., trauma-focused cognitive behavioral and processing therapy). Pharmacotherapy with certain antidepressants is recommended when these trauma-focused psychotherapies are not available or feasible when patients prefer medications.x About brexpiprazole Brexpiprazole was approved in the U.S. by the FDA in 2015, as an adjunctive therapy to antidepressants in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) and as a treatment for schizophrenia in adults. Most recently, brexpiprazole was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease, in May 2023. Brexpiprazole has also been approved in more than 60 countries worldwide, including the European Union, Canada and Japan. Brexpiprazole was discovered by Otsuka and is being co-developed by Otsuka and Lundbeck. The mechanism of action of brexpiprazole is unknown. Brexpiprazole has high receptor binding affinity to norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine receptors.

The proposed resolution to item 7 have been proposed by the Company’s shareholder Stiftelsen Industrifonden. Both proposals are supported by the Company’s larger shareholders Stiftelsen Industrifonden, Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön Item 1. Election of chairman of the meeting The Board of Directors proposes Kai Gruner to be elected Chairman of the meeting and that the Company’s CFO Martin Granlund be elected secretary of the meeting. Item 6 – Proposed resolution regarding implementing an incentive scheme for key employees and issuing warrants in connection therewith A. Implementing an incentive scheme The Board propose, supported by the Company’s larger shareholders Stiftelsen Industrifonden, Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön, that the general meeting resolve to establish a long-term incentive scheme for key employees in the Company and its subsidiaries (the "" Group "") through the issuance of warrants ("" Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028 ""). The proposal aims to create conditions to strengthen the motivation of employees that the Group has identified as important and trusted in the short and long term. The Board considers that an incentive scheme according to the present proposal is beneficial for the Group and the Company's shareholders. B. Participants and allotment of Employee Stock Options within Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028 The Board proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following terms and conditions for the allocation of employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "") within the framework of Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028. (1) The Employee Stock Options shall be allocated to key employees and senior executives in the Company (each a ""Participant""). Not more than 9,945,529 Employee Stock Options will be issued. The board shall resolve on allocation based on experience, ability, and performance. (2) Allotment of the Employee Stock Options shall take place no later than October 14th, 2025. The Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge. Only employees who are part of the aforementioned categories shall be offered the right to be awarded Employee Stock Options, provided that they have entered into a separate agreement regarding Employee Stock Options with the Company. (3) Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) warrant in the Company that has been issued in accordance with section C below and which shall be transferred from the Company’s subsidiary to the Participant in accordance with section D. (4) The Participant will be able to exercise allocated and vested Employee Stock Options from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. Allocated Employee Stock Options may only be used to acquire warrants if the Participant is still employed by the Company. (5) The Board shall be responsible for managing Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028 within the framework of the main terms and conditions stated above. C. Issuance of warrants To enable the Board's proposal according to B above, the Board proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue no more than 9,945,529 warrants, entailing an increase of the Company’s share capital when fully exercised by not more than SEK 497,276.45 (calculated on a quota value of SEK 0.05). The following terms and conditions shall apply to the resolution. (1) The right to subscribe for the warrants shall, with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right, vest in the company's subsidiary, Freemelt AB (the "" Subsidiary ""), with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to the Participant according to section B above. (2) The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the warrants shall be able to be used for the implementation of Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028. (3) The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. (4) Subscription of the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list within seven days of the general meeting's resolution. (5) The Board has the right to extend the subscription period. (6) Each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the Company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. (7) The subscription price for the shares upon exercise of the warrants shall amount to SEK 2.50. (8) Shares which are newly issued following subscription shall entitle the holder to a dividend at the first record date for the dividend following the date which occurs after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered into the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB. (9) Warrants that are held by the Subsidiary and that have not been transferred in accordance with section B above may be cancelled by the Company following a decision by the Company’s Board of directors. Cancellation shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The warrants shall in addition to the above be subject to the terms and conditions set out in “Villkor för teckningsoptioner av Serie E 2025/2028 i Freemelt Holding AB (publ)”. The terms and conditions will inter alia show that the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription can be recalculated in case of, inter alia, new issues of shares and bonus issues. D. Approval of transfer of warrants (1) The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall accrue to the Participant, provided that the Participant is still employed. (2) One (1) Employee Stock Option gives the right to acquire one (1) warrant. Notification of the acquisition of warrants must take place during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. The warrants are acquired free of charge by the Participant. (3) In connection with the notification of the acquisition of warrants, the Participant shall submit an irrevocable power of attorney to a representative of the Company authorizing the representative to, in the Participant's name and on his/her behalf, immediately after the Subsidiary transfers the warrant to the Participant, use the received warrants to subscribe for shares in the Company. E. Further information regarding the incentive scheme (1) Dilution The conversion of warrants will happen through a so called “net exercise” which means the actual dilution as a consequence of the incentive scheme will be lower than what is indicated by its nominal size. Without “net exercise” the maximum number of new shares at full subscription would be 9,945,529, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 5.0 percent calculated on the number of shares after full subscription, subject, however, to the recalculation of the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription of. Dilution of 5.0 percent is a theoretical maximum that will not be achieved within the “net exercise” design. Exact dilution will depend on the share price at conversion in relation to the exercise price. If, for example, the share price at the conversion day is a) three times, or b) four times, or c) six times higher than the exercise price, the dilution will be approximately a) 0.3 percent, b) 0.4 percent and c) 0.4 percent. (2) Costs for the Company It is the opinion of the Board that the Employee Stock Options at expiry can result in costs for the Company in the form of wage costs, social security costs and some minor consultancy and administrative costs related to the incentive scheme. Based on an assumed share price of SEK 1.94 at the time of subscription, an assumed exercise price of SEK 2.50, an expected term of 3.0 years, a risk-free interest rate of 1.966 percent, an assumed volatility of 47.5 percent and no expected dividend during the term, the value (for accounting purposes of wages and social security costs) of each Employee Stock Option has been calculated to SEK 0.499 and SEK 5.0 million for all Employee Stock Options in Incitamentsprogram E 2025/2028. If there is a positive share price development, assuming a share price of SEK 5.00, assuming that all Employee Stock Options have been subscribed to and that they are all being exercised to acquire 5,022,994 shares after applying “net exercise”, assuming that average social security costs are 31.42 percent, then Incitamentsprogram E2025/2028 will result in accounting costs totalling SEK 24,863,823 and social security costs totalling SEK 7,812,213. Above calculations are preliminary. The purpose is to present an example regarding potential costs that the incentive scheme can lead to. Actual costs may deviate from what is stated above. The incentive scheme is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company’s key figures. (3) Preparation of the proposal The principles for the incentive scheme have been worked out by the Board, and it has support from the Company’s largest shareholders. The proposal has been prepared with the support of external advisors. The Board has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the EGM. (4) Other incentive schemes The Company has current incentive schemes that includes a total of 10,393,410 warrants which combined gives the right to subscribe for 10,412,850 shares in the Company. The total dilution according to these schemes amounts to 5.2 percent based on the number of shares after full subscription and without consideration taken to the “net exercise” structure applicable to the majority of outstanding warrants. The maximum dilution from incentive schemes implemented in year 2020 is 0.1 percent, from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2024 is 0.0 percent and from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2025 is 5.1 percent. The calculation is based on the number of shares after full subscription. Within incentive schemes implemented in year 2025, a total of 8,719,467 warrants remain which have not been acquired by a participant. These will be cancelled which has been considered in the above dilution calculation. (5) Majority requirement The Board, or a person appointed by the Board, shall be authorized to make the minor changes in the resolution that may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB. The proposals, according to A-E, shall be treated and seen as one and the same resolution. The EGM's resolution regarding this item is valid only if it is supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. Item 7 – Proposed resolution regarding implementing an incentive scheme for the Board and issuing warrants in connection therewith A. Implementing an incentive scheme Shareholder Stiftelsen Industrifonden propose, supported by the Company’s larger shareholders Coeli, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön, that the general meeting resolve to establish a long-term incentive scheme for Board members in the Company and its subsidiaries (the "" Group "") through the issuance of so-called qualified employee stock options in accordance with Ch. 11a. of the Swedish Income Tax Act (1999:1229) ("" Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 "") and issuance of options ("" Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 ""). The proposal aims to create conditions to strengthen the motivation of Board members. Stiftelsen Industrifonden considers that an incentive scheme according to the present proposal is beneficial for the Group and the Company's shareholders. B. Participants and allotment of Employee Stock Options within Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 Stiftelsen Industrifonden proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following terms and conditions for the allocation of qualified employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "") within the framework of Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028. (1) The Employee Stock Options shall be allocated to the Chairman of the Board (the ""Participant""). Not more than 943,778 Employee Stock Options will be issued, conditional that the total number of warrants in both incentive schemes do not exceed 943,778 (as set out in section D). (2) Allotment of the Employee Stock Options shall take place no later than October 14th, 2025. The Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge.

(3) Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) warrant in the Company that has been issued in accordance with section D below and which shall be transferred from the Company’s subsidiary to the Participant in accordance with section E. (4) The Participant will be able to exercise allocated and vested Employee Stock Options from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. Allocated Employee Stock Options may only be used to acquire warrants if the Participant is still a Board member or employed. (5) Stiftelsen Industrifonden shall be responsible for managing Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 within the framework of the main terms and conditions stated above. C. Participants and allotment of options within Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 Stiftelsen Industrifonden proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following terms and conditions for the allocation of options ("" TO D "") within the framework of Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028. (1) The TO D shall be allocated to the Chairman of the Board (the ""Participant""). Not more than 943,778 TO D will be issued, conditional that the total number of warrants in both incentive schemes do not exceed 943,778 (as set out in section D). (2) Allotment of the TO D shall take place no later than October 14th, 2025. Payment of the options premium shall take place within two weeks of subscription. The TO D price will be set using an established valuation methodology, such as Black & Scholes valuation model, to ensure a valuation in accordance with market terms. Only the Chairman of the Board shall be offered the right to subscribe to TO D, provided that the Participant has entered into a separate agreement regarding TO D with the Company. At subscription, the Company shall retain the right to repurchase TO D in situations such as the Participant ending his/her Board engagement or employment, or if the Participant wishes to pass on the TO D to a third party. (3) Each TO D entitles the holder to acquire one (1) warrant in the Company that has been issued in accordance with section D below and which shall be transferred from the Company’s subsidiary to the Participant in accordance with section E. (4) The Participant will be able to exercise allocated and vested TO D from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. (5) Stiftelsen Industrifonden shall be responsible for managing the Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 within the framework of the main terms and conditions stated above. D. Issuance of warrants To enable Stifelsen Industrifonden’s proposal according to B and C above, Stiftelsen Industrifonden proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue no more than 943,778 warrants, entailing an increase of the Company’s share capital when fully exercised by not more than SEK 47,188.90 (calculated on a quota value of SEK 0.05). The following terms and conditions shall apply to the resolution. (1) The right to subscribe for the warrants shall, with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right, vest in the company's subsidiary, Freemelt AB (the "" Subsidiary ""), with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to the Participant according to section B and C above. (2) The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the warrants shall be able to be used for the implementation of the Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 and Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028. (3) The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. (4) Subscription of the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list within seven days of the general meeting's resolution. (5) Stiftelsen Industrifonden has the right to extend the subscription period. (6) Each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the Company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. (7) The subscription price for the shares upon exercise of the warrants shall amount to SEK 2.50. (8) Shares which are newly issued following subscription shall entitle the holder to a dividend at the first record date for the dividend following the date which occurs after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered into the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB. (9) Warrants that are held by the Subsidiary and that have not been transferred in accordance with section B and C above may be cancelled by the Company following a decision by the Company’s Board of directors. Cancellation shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The warrants shall in addition to the above be subject to the terms and conditions set out in “Villkor för teckningsoptioner av Serie C & D 2025/2028 i Freemelt Holding AB (publ)”. The terms and conditions will inter alia show that the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription can be recalculated in case of, inter alia, new issues of shares and bonus issues. E. Approval of transfer of warrants (1) The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall accrue to the Participant, provided that the Participant is still a Board member or an employee of the Company (and that other prerequisites for qualified employee stock options according to the Sweden Income Tax Act are met regarding Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028). (2) One (1) Employee Stock Option gives the right to acquire one (1) warrant and one (1) TO D gives the right to acquire one (1) warrant. Notification of the acquisition of warrants must take place during the period from and including 1 November 2028 up to and including 30 November 2028. The warrants are acquired free of charge by the Participant. (3) In connection with the notification of the acquisition of warrants, the Participant shall submit an irrevocable power of attorney to a representative of the Company authorizing the representative to, in the Participant's name and on his/her behalf, immediately after the Subsidiary transfers the warrant to the Participant, use the received warrants to subscribe for shares in the Company. F. Further information regarding the incentive scheme (1) Dilution The conversion of warrants will happen through a so called “net exercise” which means the actual dilution as a consequence of the incentive schemes will be lower than what is indicated by its nominal size. Without “net exercise” the maximum number of new shares at full subscription in both schemes would be 943,778, corresponding to a dilution of approximately 0.5 percent calculated using the number of shares after full subscription, subject, however, to the recalculation of the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription of. Dilution of 0.5 percent is a theoretical maximum that will not be achieved within the “net exercise” design. Exact dilution will depend on the share price at conversion in relation to the exercise price. If, for example, the share price at the conversion day is a) three times, or b) four times, or c) six times higher than the exercise price, the dilution will be approximately a) 0.3 percent, b) 0.4 percent and c) 0.4 percent. (2) Costs for the Company It is the assessment of the Company’s advisors that the tax regulations for qualified employee stock options according to Ch. 11a of the Sweden Income Tax Act is applicable to the Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028. It is further assessed that the Participant will acquire securities at market terms within Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 and consequently there is no taxable benefit as set out in the Sweden Income Tax Act or the Act on Social Fees. Taking this into account, the Company's costs for Incitamentsprogram C 2025/2028 and Incitamentsprogram D 2025/2028 are calculated to only consist of costs for the preparation, implementation and administration of the schemes as well as guidance of the tax situation. (3) Preparation of the proposal The principles for the incentive schemes have been worked out by Stiftelsen Industrifonden, and it has support from the Company’s larger shareholders Coeli Fonder, Bengt Julander and Carlbergssjön. The proposal has been prepared with the support of external advisors. Stiftelsen Industrifonden has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the EGM. Board members have not been involved in setting the terms. (4) Other incentive schemes The Company has current incentive schemes that includes a total of 10,393,410 warrants which combined gives the right to subscribe for 10,412,850 shares in the Company. The total dilution according to these schemes amounts to 5.2 percent based on the number of shares after full subscription and without consideration taken to the “net exercise” structure applicable to the majority of outstanding warrants. The maximum dilution from incentive schemes implemented in year 2020 is 0.1 percent, from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2024 is 0.0 percent and from the incentive scheme implemented in year 2025 is 5.1 percent. The calculation is based on the number of shares after full subscription. Within incentive schemes implemented in year 2025, a total of 8,719,467 warrants remain which have not been acquired by a participant.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that C3.ai and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm urges investors in C3.ai who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. C3.ai, Inc. (AI) Securities Class Action: According to the complaint, filed under the caption Liggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuit alleges that these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive. The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%. The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later than October 21, 2025. “We’re focused on whether C3.ai’s public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health was affecting the company’s ability to close deals and meet financial targets,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

The suit, filed in the Eastern District of New York, comes after a dramatic stock price decline in August following the company’s earnings report. Video: The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. - Class Period: May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 27, 2025 - Contact the Firm Now: - Phone: 844-916-0895 - Email: - Website Form: LifeMD, Inc. (LFMD) Securities Class Action: The lawsuit, captioned Johnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7 and August 5, 2025. It alleges that LifeMD made false and misleading statements, particularly on May 6, 2025, when it reported its first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The complaint claims that the company’s optimistic outlook, which cited a “category-defining competitive moat” in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand, was false as it misleadingly failed to account for crucial business challenges. The suit contends that LifeMD was experiencing rising customer acquisition costs in its RexMD segment and a higher-than-anticipated refund rate in its weight management business, issues that it did not disclose to investors at the time. The alleged deception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings per share estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance. During the earnings call, management cited ""temporary elevated customer acquisition costs"" for its RexMD business and issues with patient refunds for its weight management offerings. The following day, LifeMD's stock price plummeted by over 44%. For investors who suffered substantial losses during this period, the lawsuit represents an opportunity to recover damages. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Hagens Berman, a national plaintiffs’ rights firm, is investigating these claims. “We’re investigating whether LifeMD knew of but failed to disclose key operational problems,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

The quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $0.32 per common share and represents a reduction from the previous quarter’s annual rate of $0.60 per common share. During October, we intend to prepay a secured loan using a combination of cash on hand, our $600 million unsecured line-of-credit and proceeds from additional sources of liquidity, as appropriate. The secured loan totals $245 million and has a scheduled maturity date in February 2028 and is currently secured by 7 properties totaling 1.4 million square feet located in several of our segments. If the secured loan is prepaid, Brandywine will have a wholly owned operating portfolio that is fully unencumbered. We estimate the prepayment will result in a fourth quarter earnings charge totaling $12-$14 million, or $0.07-$0.09 per common share which is currently not included in our 2025 earnings guidance. Management Comments “The repayment of our remaining secured loan will fully unencumber our consolidated operating portfolio,” stated Jerry Sweeney, President and CEO of Brandywine Realty Trust. “This prepayment, based on current assumptions, including in-place leases at the secured loan properties, is expected to increase our unencumbered annual cash flow by approximately $45 million while also providing additional asset-level leasing flexibility. In addition, while our operating business plan objectives remain on target we also announced an adjustment to our quarterly dividend from $0.15 to $0.08. This dividend reduction is expected to enable us to retain approximately $50 million of cash to be used for accretive investment activities, including investing in our operating portfolio, recapitalizing our existing development projects, and further improving overall liquidity. This revised dividend represents a level that we expect to maintain for the foreseeable future.” Conference Call and Audio Webcast We expect to release our third quarter earnings after market close on Wednesday October 22, 2025, and we expect to host our third quarter conference call on Thursday October 23, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Highlights for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 - Transaction volume was 11,606 units for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 40.4% from 8,264 units in the last quarter and an increase of 107.1% from 5,605 units in the same period last year. - Retail transaction volume was 10,385 units for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 37.6% from 7,545 units in the last quarter and an increase of 153.9% from 4,090 units in the same period last year. - Total revenues were RMB658.3 million (US$91.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 30.6% from RMB504.2 million in the last quarter and an increase of 64.1% from RMB401.2 million in the same period last year. - Gross margin was 5.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with 7.0% in the last quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. - Loss from operations was RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB35.3 million in the last quarter and RMB62.5 million in the same period last year. - Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA [1] was a loss of RMB16.5 million (US$2.3 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with a loss of RMB8.9 million in the last quarter and a loss of RMB33.9 million in the same period last year. Mr. Kun Dai, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Uxin, commented, ""Our business sustained its strong growth momentum in the second quarter of 2025, with retail transaction volume reaching 10,385 units, representing a 154% year-over-year increase and marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth above 140%. Importantly, we have also maintained healthy operating efficiency, with inventory turnover days stable at around 30, and customer satisfaction, as measured by NPS (net promoter score), at an industry-leading 65. Reflecting this strength, we now expect retail transaction volume growth of over 125% year-over-year in the third quarter. Accordingly, we are raising our full-year 2025 growth guidance to approximately 130% compared to calendar year 2024."" Mr. Dai continued, ""Since opening in February, our Wuhan superstore has performed ahead of expectations, achieving monthly sales of about 1,400 units with steadily improving profitability. At the same time, the expansion of our new superstores is progressing on schedule, with our Zhengzhou superstore officially commencing operations on September 27. We believe that the continued ramp-up of newly launched superstores, together with the sales momentum at our existing locations, will serve as strong and sustainable growth drivers for our business performance in the years ahead."" Mr. Feng Lin, Chief Financial Officer of Uxin, stated, ""Our strong sales growth this quarter was driven by improved inventory availability at existing stores and the continued ramp-up of our new superstore in Wuhan. Total revenues reached RMB658.3 million, including RMB607.6 million from retail vehicle sales, representing 87% year-over-year growth and 31% sequential growth. Our gross margin was 5.2%, reflecting the temporary impact of the new car price war in China, as well as the early-stage ramp-up of our Wuhan superstore. Looking ahead, we anticipate that unhealthy price competition in China's new car market will be largely resolved thanks to supportive government policies and sales and profitability of our Wuhan superstore will continue to improve. As a result, we anticipate a strong rebound in our overall gross margin in the near future. Specifically, for the third quarter of 2025, we expect retail transaction volume of 13,500 to 14,000 units, representing over 125% year-over-year growth, total revenues of between RMB830 million and RMB860 million, and gross margin recovery to approximately 7.5%."" Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2025 Total revenues were RMB658.3 million (US$91.9 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 30.6% from RMB504.2 million in the last quarter and an increase of 64.1% from RMB401.2 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to the increase in retail vehicle sales revenue. Retail vehicle sales revenue was RMB607.6 million (US$84.8 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 30.5% from RMB465.5 million in the last quarter and an increase of 87.0% from RMB325.0 million in the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, retail transaction volume was 10,385 units, representing an increase of 37.6% from 7,545 units last quarter and an increase of 153.9% from 4,090 units in the same period last year. By offering quality products and services, the Company's superstores have earned customer trust and established Uxin as the well-recognized brand in regional markets, leading to a high in-store customer conversion rate. Additionally, since the Company's newly launched superstore in Wuhan commenced trial operations in February 2025, both its inventory levels and sales have increased rapidly. Wholesale vehicle sales revenue was RMB29.9 million (US$4.2 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB22.5 million in the last quarter and RMB63.9 million in the same period last year. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, wholesale transaction volume was 1,221 units, representing an increase of 69.8% from 719 units last quarter and a decrease of 19.4% from 1,515 units in the same period last year.

Gross margin was 5.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with 7.0% in the last quarter and 6.4% in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in gross margin was mainly due to aggressive promotions in the new car sector in China during this quarter, which also put pressure on the gross margin for used cars. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was mainly due to the trial operation of our new superstore in Wuhan, which commenced in February 2025. As the store is still in the early stage of operation, it is currently in a gross profit ramp-up phase. The Company expects that its overall gross margin will recover in the third quarter of 2025. Total operating expenses were RMB96.7 million (US$13.5 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025. Total operating expenses excluding the impact of share-based compensation were RMB86.8 million. - Sales and marketing expenses were RMB74.2 million (US$10.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, an increase of 20.3% from RMB61.7 million in the last quarter and an increase of 25.0% from RMB59.4 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to the increased salaries for the sales teams. - General and administrative expenses were RMB19.4 million (US$2.7 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 6.0% from RMB18.3 million in the last quarter and a decrease of 30.9% from RMB28.1 million in the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the impact of share-based compensation expenses. - Research and development expenses were RMB3.1 million (US$0.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 6.6% from RMB2.9 million in the last quarter and a decrease of 8.6% from RMB3.4 million in the same period last year. Other operating income, net was RMB19.4 million (US$2.7 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB11.9 million for the last quarter and RMB2.8 million in the same period last year. The increases were mainly due to gains from derecognition of certain long-aged liabilities. Loss from operations was RMB43.1 million (US$6.0 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with RMB35.3 million in the last quarter and RMB62.5 million in the same period last year. Interest expenses were RMB23.1 million (US$3.2 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, representing an increase of 2.5% from RMB22.5 million in the last quarter and an increase of 1.0% from RMB22.9 million in the same period last year. Net loss from operations was net loss of RMB67.6 million (US$9.4 million) for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with net loss of RMB51.4 million in the last quarter and net loss of RMB49.8 million in the same period last year.

Based on the Company's liquidity assessment, which considers the management's plan to address these adverse conditions and events including growing its vehicle sales revenue by increasing the sales volume, improving the gross profit margin by increasing the value-added services offered to its customers, maintaining vehicle turnover rate by managing reasonable vehicle prices, raising funds from planned financings, and adjusting its operation scale if and when necessary, the Company believes that it is probable to effectively implement these plans and accordingly, its current cash and cash equivalents which included funds from equity and debt financings and the cash flows from operations are sufficient for the Company to meet its anticipated working capital requirements and other capital commitments and the Company will be able to meet its payment obligations when liabilities that fall due within the next twelve months from the date of this release.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures In evaluating the business, the Company considers and uses certain non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net loss from operations per share – basic and diluted, as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of the non-GAAP financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding share-based compensation, foreign exchange (losses)/gain, other income/(expenses), structure realignment cost which was mainly severance cost and equity in income of affiliates. The Company defines adjusted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share – basic and diluted as net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders per share excluding impact of share-based compensation, deemed dividend to preferred shareholders due to triggering of a down round feature and accretion on redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company presents the non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by the management to evaluate the operating performance and formulate business plans. The Company also believes that the use of the non-GAAP measures facilitate investors' assessment of its operating performance as this measure excludes certain finance or non-cash items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations. The Company believe that excluding these items enables us to evaluate our performance period-over-period more effectively and relative to our competitors. The non-GAAP financial measures are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA is that it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect the Company's operations. Share-based compensation, other income/(expenses) and foreign exchange (losses)/gain have been and may continue to be incurred in the business. Further, the non-GAAP measures may differ from the non-GAAP information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. The Company compensates for these limitations by reconciling the non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest U.S. GAAP performance measure, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company's performance. The Company encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. Reconciliations of Uxin's non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure are included at the end of this press release.

The suit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, claims that C3.ai and certain executives violated the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm urges investors in C3.ai who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: Feb. 26, 2025 – Aug. 8, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 21, 2025 Visit: Contact the Firm Now: 844-916-0895 C3.ai, Inc. (AI) Securities Class Action: According to the complaint, filed under the caption Liggett v. C3.ai, Inc., the company projected an overly optimistic picture of its revenue and growth potential. The lawsuit alleges that these projections downplayed the significant risk posed by CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health issues. The plaintiffs contend that C3.ai's public statements on growth and profitability were ""unrealistic"" and depended too heavily on the health and performance of its chief executive. The case focuses on a significant drop in stock price that followed C3.ai's financial announcement on August 8, 2025. On that date, the company disclosed preliminary first-quarter results that fell short of expectations and lowered its revenue guidance for the full fiscal year. C3.ai attributed these disappointing results to ""reorganization with new leadership"" and Siebel's health problems. Following this news, the stock price reportedly plummeted by more than 25%. The lawsuit seeks to represent investors who purchased or acquired C3.ai securities during the specified class period. Investors who suffered substantial losses and are interested in serving as a lead plaintiff must file a motion with the court no later than October 21, 2025. “We’re focused on whether C3.ai’s public statements were misleading in their failure to fully disclose how CEO Thomas M. Siebel’s health was affecting the company’s ability to close deals and meet financial targets,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation.

Follow the link below for more information: [CONTACT THE FIRM IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS] What Happened? On August 6, 2025, Fortinet released its second quarter 2025 financial results, revealing that the Company was “approximately 40% to 50% of the way through the 2026 [firewall] upgrade cycle at the end of the second quarter based on the remaining active units and service contracts.” Additionally, the Company issued weaker than expected revenue guidance for the upcoming third quarter, projecting revenue between $1.67 billion and $1.73 billion. On this news, the price of Fortinet shares declined by $21.28 per share, or approximately 22%, from $96.58 per share on August 6, 2025 to close at $75.30 on August 7, 2025. What Is The Lawsuit About? The lawsuit has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased securities during the period of November 8, 2024 through August 6, 2025, inclusive (“the Class Period”). The lawsuit alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements concerning the business impact and sustainability of a purportedly “record” round of FortiGate unit upgrades. Defendants represented that this “refresh cycle” was ""by far the largest we’ve seen probably ever,” would generate “around $400 million to $450 million in product revenue” in 2025 and 2026, and would create strong opportunities to cross-sell additional products and services. Defendants also represented that the refresh cycle would “gain momentum” in the second half of 2025 and beyond. These statements were materially false and misleading. In truth, Defendants knew that the refresh cycle would never be as lucrative as they represented because it consisted of old products that were a “small percentage” of the Company’s business. Moreover, Defendants misrepresented and concealed that they did not have a clear picture of the true number of FortiGate firewalls that could be upgraded. And while telling investors that the refresh would gain momentum over the course of two years, Fortinet misrepresented and concealed that it had aggressively pushed through roughly half of the refresh in a period of just a few months, by the end of 2Q 2025.

Vail Resorts also provided its outlook for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2026, declared a dividend payable in October 2025, and announced the share repurchases completed during the quarter. Highlights - Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. was $280.0 million for fiscal 2025 compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. of $231.1 million for fiscal 2024. - Resort Reported EBITDA was $844.1 million for fiscal 2025, which included $15.2 million of one-time costs related to the previously announced two-year resource efficiency transformation plan, $8.1 million of one-time costs related to the Company's previously announced Chief Executive Officer (""CEO"") transition, and $1.2 million of acquisition and integration related expenses. Resort Reported EBITDA was $825.1 million for fiscal 2024. - Pass product sales through September 19, 2025 for the upcoming 2025/2026 North American ski season decreased approximately 3% in units and increased approximately 1% in sales dollars as compared to the prior year period through September 20, 2024. Pass product sales are adjusted to eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by applying current U.S. dollar exchange rates to both current period and prior period sales for Whistler Blackcomb. - The Company provided its outlook for fiscal 2026 and expects net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. to be between $201 million and $276 million and Resort Reported EBITDA to be between $842 million and $898 million, which includes an estimated $14 million of one-time costs in support of the Company's resource efficiency transformation plan. - The Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.22 per share of Vail Resorts' common stock that will be payable on October 27, 2025 to shareholders of record as of October 9, 2025. In addition, the Company repurchased approximately 1.29 million shares during the quarter at an average price of approximately $156 per share for a total of $200 million. For the full fiscal year, the Company repurchased approximately 1.69 million shares, or 4.5% of shares outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal 2025, at an average price of approximately $163 per share for a total of $270 million. - On July 2, 2025, the Company completed an offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2030. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility incurred to fund the repurchase of $200 million of its outstanding shares of common stock completed in June 2025 and to fund off-season liquidity. The Company intends to use the remaining proceeds, together with its available liquidity, including the U.S. delayed draw term loan availability for the repurchase or repayment of a portion of its outstanding 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 at or prior to their maturity on January 1, 2026. Commenting on the Company's fiscal 2025 results, Rob Katz, Chief Executive Officer, said, ""The Company achieved 2% growth in Resort Reported EBITDA despite total skier visits declining 3% across our North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas versus the prior year. Visitation reflects the benefit of improved conditions in the second quarter relative to the prior year, offset by the expected decline in visitation from selling fewer pass units for the 2024/2025 North American ski season. For the full year, Resort net revenue increased 3% driven by a 4% increase in season pass revenue and increased ancillary spend per guest across our ski school and dining businesses. Resort Reported EBITDA for fiscal 2025 also reflects strong cost discipline, including $37 million of savings from the resource efficiency transformation plan before one-time costs. The Company's full year Resort Reported EBITDA growth is partially offset by $14 million of increased costs from company-wide performance-based management incentive plan expense that was not earned in the prior year, $15 million of one-time costs related to the two-year resource efficiency transformation plan, $8 million of one-time costs related to the Company's previously announced CEO transition, and $5 million unfavorable EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the prior year. Excluding these impacts and removing the impact of Crans-Montana operating results and acquisition, closing, and integration expenses in both periods, Resort Reported EBITDA increased approximately 6% compared to the prior year, despite the decline in total skier visits across our North American resorts versus the prior year, highlighting strong cost discipline and the impacts of the resource efficiency transformation plan."" Regarding the Company's fiscal 2025 fourth quarter results, Katz said, ""Our fiscal fourth quarter historically operates at a loss, given that our North American and European mountain resorts are generally not open for ski season operations during the period. The quarter's results were primarily driven by winter operating results from our Australian resorts and our North American and European resorts' summer activities, dining, retail/rental and lodging operations, and administrative expenses. Fourth quarter Resort Reported EBITDA decreased 8% versus prior year primarily driven by $8 million of costs related to the Company's previously announced CEO transition, $5 million of one-time costs related to the Company's resource efficiency transformation plan, and $1 million unfavorable EBITDA impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. We are pleased with the demand across our North American and European summer operations during the fourth quarter, which was in line with our expectations. In Australia, we are encouraged by the improved visitation relative to prior year, which was supported by improved weather conditions and the growth in pass sales for the 2025 Australian winter season, benefitting from the introduction of the Epic Australia Day Pass."" Operating Results A more complete discussion of our operating results can be found within the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2025, which was filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The discussion of operating results below compares the results for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2025 to the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, unless otherwise noted. The following are segment highlights: Mountain Segment - Total lift revenue increased $60.4 million, or 4.2%, compared to the prior year, to $1,503.2 million, which was primarily due to an increase in pass product revenue of 4.2%, primarily driven by an increase in pass pricing for the 2024/2025 North American ski season. Non-pass product lift revenue increased 4.2% compared to the prior year as a result of an increase in non-pass effective ticket price (""ETP"") (excluding Crans-Montana) of 5.1% and incremental non-pass revenue from Crans-Montana of $15.4 million, partially offset by a reduction in non-pass visitation (excluding Crans-Montana). - Ski school revenue increased $5.3 million, or 1.7%, driven by increased lesson pricing and incremental revenue from Crans-Montana, partially offset by decreased skier visitation. - Dining revenue increased $13.3 million, or 5.9%, driven by incremental revenue from Crans-Montana and increased guest spend per visit, partially offset by decreased skier visitation. - Retail/rental revenue decreased $14.7 million, or 4.6%, for which retail revenues decreased $11.7 million, or 6.4%, driven by lower sales at our on-mountain retail locations, and rental revenues decreased $3.0 million, or 2.2%, driven by decreased skier visitation. - Operating expense increased $69.1 million, or 4.0%, which was primarily attributable to increased variable expenses associated with increased revenue and incremental operating expenses from Crans-Montana. - Mountain Reported EBITDA increased $19.3 million, or 2.4%, compared to the prior year, which includes $29.6 million of stock-based compensation expense compared to $23.2 million in the prior year. The increase in stock-based compensation was primarily driven by accelerated vesting of awards associated with the CEO transition. Mountain segment results also include the impact of one-time expenses attributable to the Company's resource efficiency transformation plan of $14.9 million, one-time expenses attributable to the CEO transition of $6.8 million and acquisition and integration related expenses of $1.2 million and $8.0 million in 2025 and 2024, respectively. Lodging Segment - Lodging segment net revenue (excluding payroll cost reimbursements) was $319.7 million or approximately flat compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased summer visitation and demand for summer lodging at our North American resort properties, including the Grand Teton Lodge Company, offset by lower revenue during winter at our managed condominium rooms due to lower ADR during the peak holiday period and a net reduction in our inventory of available managed condominium rooms proximate to our mountain resorts. - Lodging Reported EBITDA decreased $0.2 million, or 1.0% compared to the prior year, which includes $4.0 million of stock-based compensation expense compared to $3.3 million in the prior year. Lodging segment results also include the impact of one-time expenses attributable to our resource efficiency transformation plan of $1.6 million and one-time expenses attributable to the CEO transition of $1.3 million. Resort - Combination of Mountain and Lodging Segments - Resort net revenue was $2,963.9 million, an increase of $83.4 million as compared to Resort net revenue of $2,880.5 million in the prior year. - Resort Reported EBITDA was $844.1 million, an increase of $19.0 million, or 2.3%, compared to the prior year, which includes the impact of one-time expenses attributable to our resource efficiency transformation plan of $15.2 million, one-time expenses attributable to the CEO transition of $8.1 million and acquisition and integration related expenses of $1.2 million in 2025 and $8.0 million of integration expenses in 2024. Real Estate Segment - Real Estate Reported EBITDA increased $17.2 million compared to the prior year, which includes a gain on sale of real property for $16.5 million related to our East Vail property and a gain on sale of real property for $8.5 million related to the sale of three real estate parcels in Breckenridge, Colorado. Total Performance - Total net revenue increased $79.2 million, or 2.7%, to $2,964.3 million as compared to the prior year. - Net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. was $280.0 million, or $7.53 per diluted share compared to net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. of $231.1 million, or $6.09 per diluted share, in the prior year. Remarking on the overall business performance, Katz said, ""The results from this past season were below expectations and our season-to-date pass sales growth has been limited. We recognize that we are not yet delivering on the full growth potential that we expect from this business, in particular on revenue growth, in both this past season and in our projected guidance for fiscal year 2026. However, we are confident that we are well positioned to return to higher growth in fiscal year 2027 and beyond. ""Our approach to engaging with guests has not kept pace with shifting consumer behaviors and as a result, we have not been able to fully capitalize on our competitive advantages or adapted our execution appropriately to respond to shifting dynamics. While email was for many years our most effective channel, its impact has declined significantly in recent years, and we've been slow to shift to new and emerging marketing channels. We also believe we need to shift more focus to marketing our lift ticket business, which has not received the same level of focus, creativity, and resources as pass penetration increased. Finally, we see tremendous opportunity to continue to enhance the My Epic App, which is already effectively driving mobile engagement, with native commerce and key payment integrations to increase guest purchase conversion. ""We are fully committed to executing a multi-year strategy that unlocks the full potential of our business. This strategy is rooted in leveraging our strong competitive advantages to drive sustained, profitable growth. We own and operate 42 resorts with unmatched scale, brand strength, and direct access to guest data across all lines of business. This enables us to optimize marketing, product, and pricing strategies across lift tickets and passes, and to invest in the highest return opportunities across our network. Our integrated model also positions us to capitalize on emerging technologies that are defining the current marketing environment to drive sustained, profitable growth across lift revenue, as well as ancillary revenue, which will continue to be a focus for the Company. ""Our immediate priority is increasing guest visitation to our resorts, which is essential to driving growth in revenue and free cash flow. Consistent with our long-standing focus on delivering exceptional guest experiences, we will continue to invest in our resorts and our employees. At the same time, we are taking decisive steps that we believe will rebuild lift ticket visitation, evolve our guest engagement approach to better reach and convert guests, and reaccelerate growth of our pass program. These steps are critical to strengthening our long-term financial performance. ""On the first item, we are focused on rebuilding lift ticket visitation, an essential driver of revenue and long-term growth. We are strategically enhancing lift ticket offerings, pricing strategies, and our marketing approach aimed at bringing in new guests to our resorts in ways that complement our pass program. In August, we introduced Epic Friend Tickets, a new benefit for 2025/2026 Epic Pass holders giving them the ability to share discounted lift tickets with family and friends. In addition to celebrating the social side of skiing and riding, we anticipate this benefit will drive lift ticket sales for new guests to join their friends or family at our resorts at an attractive value. The full value of the ticket can be applied towards a future pass purchase, which we expect to be a powerful tool for future pass conversion. As an additional step to drive increased guest visitation, we are evolving our lift ticket pricing strategy with more targeted adjustments by resort and by time period. This allows us to balance guest access and value while optimizing demand, particularly in off-peak periods, without compromising the strength of our pass program. We are also increasing our media investment with a focus on top of funnel awareness of our resorts, to help us reach new audiences and drive incremental visitation throughout the winter, while we continue to innovate our lift ticket product offerings for the upcoming ski season. Beyond the expected immediate impact on visitation, lift ticket guests represent a high-conversion population for future pass sales, which supports our pass growth in fiscal year 2027 and beyond. ""We are also evolving our guest engagement strategy to better connect with skiers and riders and drive stronger performance. Our focus is to broaden our reach and modernize how we engage across channels. We plan to increase our exposure within digital and social platforms, and expand our influencer partnerships. This shift will allow us to reach guests where they are, and to fully utilize our guest data to create content that resonates and drives action. In addition, we are also aiming to elevate the individual brands of our resorts by tapping into the emotional connection guests have with our unique destinations. We believe this is an important differentiator in a competitive landscape. ""In addition to increasing guest visitation and evolving our guest engagement strategy, we continue to see meaningful opportunities to expand advance commitment and grow our pass business. The pass price reset ahead of the 2021/2022 season exceeded expectations in the initial years, and despite some modest declines recently, pass units are expected to be up over 50% in fiscal 2026 compared to fiscal 2021. This growth in our pass program has significantly strengthened our financial resilience and stability. ""To further support the expansion of our pass business, we are focused on driving long-term guest loyalty by ensuring we optimize the pass offering and continue to drive retention and conversion of new guests to the program. To that end, Epic Friend Tickets are expected to drive lift ticket visitation as outlined above, while also serving as a new benefit for unlimited pass holders. We are also investing in personalized media and influencer channels to better target and convert prospective pass holders. Looking ahead to fiscal 2027, we will be evaluating all aspects of our pass portfolio, including the product offerings, pricing, and benefits, in conjunction with our lift ticket products and pricing, with a focus on driving conversion to our highest-value, highest-frequency products and optimizing our overall lift access revenue growth. ""Finally, we will continue to invest in our people and our resorts to ensure we are delivering an Experience of a Lifetime. We are uniquely positioned to capitalize on investments in new technologies and processes that make it easier for our guests to engage with each aspect of the physical and digital experience we provide. We expect these efforts will drive both more value for our guests and revenue opportunities for the Company. ""Vail Resorts has delivered incredible stability and has an extraordinary foundation to execute on these opportunities to generate stronger long-term sustainable growth. We have irreplaceable resorts, an owned and operated business model and robust data infrastructure that we believe enables a sophisticated approach to product and pricing decisions across our resorts. We continue to execute against our growth strategies of growing the subscription model, unlocking ancillary, transforming resource efficiency, differentiating the guest experience, and expanding the resort network. In addition, we believe we have a resilient business model with demonstrated financial stability and strong free cash flow generation, and a track record of disciplined capital allocation and consistent innovation. Coupled with our passionate and talented teams, we believe we are well positioned to succeed in the future. The changes we are making in how we engage with guests to drive visitation and loyalty, combined with inherent strength of our business model, provide us confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders, our guests, our communities, and our employees in the years ahead."" Season Pass Sales Pass product sales through September 19, 2025 for the upcoming North American ski season decreased approximately 3% in units and increased approximately 1% in sales dollars as compared to the prior year period through September 20, 2024. Pass sales dollars are benefiting from the 7% price increase relative to the 2024/2025 season, partially offset by the mix impact from the relative performance of Epic Day Pass products compared to Core Epic Pass products. Pass product sales are adjusted to eliminate the impact of foreign currency by applying an exchange rate of $0.72 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar in both periods for Whistler Blackcomb pass sales. Commenting on the Company's season pass sales for the upcoming North American ski season, Katz said, ""Season to date through September 19, 2025, pass trends were generally consistent with the spring selling period, with the decline in units driven by less tenured renewing guests, those that had a pass for just one year, and fewer new passholders. Renewals are up for more loyal passholders, those guests that have had a pass for more than one year. As we enter the final period for season pass sales, we expect our December 2025 season to date growth rates compared to the prior year to be relatively consistent with our September 2025 season to date growth rates. As noted above, we continue to see long-term opportunity to further expand the reach of our pass program."" Resource Efficiency Transformation Plan Regarding the Company's resource efficiency transformation plan, Katz said, ""Vail Resorts is on track to achieve its two-year resource efficiency transformation plan, which was announced in September 2024. The transformation plan is designed to improve organizational effectiveness and scale for operating leverage as the Company grows. Through the three pillars of scaled operations, global shared services, and expanded workforce management, the Company outlined a multi-year plan to generate $100 million in annualized cost efficiencies by the end of its 2026 fiscal year. In fiscal 2025, we delivered approximately $37 million of efficiencies before one-time operating expenses, including $10 million of efficiencies that were accelerated from the original fiscal year 2026 plan. In fiscal 2026, we now expect to deliver approximately $75 million of efficiencies before one-time operating expenses, which is $8 million above the original plan. In fiscal 2026, we expect the efficiencies to be partially offset by one-time operating expenses of approximately $14 million. With the progress made to date and our continued focus in this area, we now anticipate realizing cost efficiencies in excess of the original $100 million annualized cost efficiency target in fiscal 2027 and we will provide more details on this in March 2026."" Guidance The Company is providing its initial guidance for the year ending July 31, 2026 and expects net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. to be between $201 million and $276 million for fiscal 2026. The Company expects Resort Reported EBITDA for fiscal 2026 to be between $842 million and $898 million, including an estimated $14 million in one-time costs related to the multi-year resource efficiency transformation plan. Compared to fiscal 2025, fiscal 2026 guidance assumes growth from price increases and ancillary capture, as well as the assumed benefit of approximately $38 million in incremental efficiencies related to the resource efficiency transformation plan and $9 million of Resort Reported EBITDA growth related to the assumed return to normal weather conditions in Australia in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, partially offset by lower pass unit sales, which are expected to have a negative impact on skier visits relative to the prior year, and cost inflation. At the midpoint, the guidance implies an estimated Resort EBITDA Margin for fiscal 2026 to be approximately 28.8% or 29.3% excluding one-time costs from the resource efficiency transformation plan. The guidance is based on certain assumptions, including a continuation of the current economic environment, and normal weather conditions for the 2025/2026 North American and European ski season and the 2025 and 2026 Australian ski seasons. The guidance assumes an exchange rate of $0.72 between the Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Whistler Blackcomb in Canada, an exchange rate of $0.66 between the Australian dollar and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Perisher, Falls Creek and Hotham in Australia, and an exchange rate of $1.25 between the Swiss franc and U.S. dollar related to the operations of Andermatt-Sedrun and Crans-Montana in Switzerland, and does not include any potential impacts related to future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which may be impacted by tariffs, trade disputes, or other factors. The following table reflects the forecasted guidance range for the Company's fiscal year ending July 31, 2026 for Total Reported EBITDA (after stock-based compensation expense) and reconciles net income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. guidance to such Total Reported EBITDA guidance. Liquidity and Return of Capital As of July 31, 2025, the Company's total liquidity as measured by total cash plus revolver availability and delayed draw term loan availability was approximately $1.4 billion. This includes $440 million of cash on hand, $508 million of U.S. revolver availability and $275 million of U.S. delayed draw term loan availability under the Vail Holdings Credit Agreement, and $214 million of revolver availability under the Whistler Credit Agreement. Subsequent to July 31, 2025, the Company amended its Whistler Credit Agreement, including extending the maturity date to September 24, 2030. In connection with the extension, the size of the Whistler Credit Agreement was reduced from $300 million Canadian dollars to $250 million Canadian dollars. As of July 31, 2025, the Company's Net Debt was 3.2 times its trailing twelve months Total Reported EBITDA. On July 2, 2025 the Company completed an offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2030. The Company used a portion of the proceeds from the offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility incurred to fund off-season liquidity and the repurchase of $200 million of its outstanding shares of common stock completed in June 2025. Additionally, it intends to use the remaining proceeds, together with its available liquidity, including the U.S. delayed draw term loan availability, for the repurchase or repayment of its outstanding 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 at or prior to their maturity on January 1, 2026. Regarding the return of capital to shareholders, the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on Vail Resorts' common stock of $2.22 per share. The dividend will be payable on October 27, 2025 to shareholders of record as of October 9, 2025. In addition, the Company repurchased approximately 1.29 million shares during the quarter at an average price of approximately $156 per share for a total of $200 million. For the full fiscal year, the Company repurchased approximately 1.69 million shares, or 4.5% of shares outstanding as of the beginning of fiscal 2025, at an average price of approximately $163 per share for a total of $270 million. The Company has 1.5 million shares remaining under its authorization for share repurchases. Commenting on capital allocation, Katz said, ""We remain committed to a disciplined and balanced approach as stewards of our shareholders' capital. We continue to prioritize investments that enhance our guest and employee experience, provide high-return capital projects, and enable strategic acquisition opportunities. After these priorities, we focus on returning excess capital to shareholders. In the current environment, the Company looks to balance its approach between share repurchases and dividends. The current dividend level reflects the strong cash flow generation of the business with any future growth in the dividend dependent on a material increase in future cash flows and the Company also maintains an opportunistic approach to share repurchases based on the value of the shares."" Capital Investments Regarding calendar year 2025 capital expenditures, as previously announced, the Company expects its capital plan to be approximately $198 million to $203 million in core capital, before $46 million of growth capital investments at its European resorts, comprised of $43 million at Andermatt-Sedrun and $3 million at Crans-Montana, and $5 million of real estate related capital projects to complete multi-year transformational investments at the key base area portals of Breckenridge Peak 8 and Keystone River Run, and planning investments to support the development of the West Lionshead area into a fourth base village at Vail Mountain. Including European growth capital investments and real estate related capital, the Company plans to invest approximately $249 million to $254 million in calendar year 2025. Key capital investments include the multi-year transformational investment plans at Park City Mountain, which includes the new Sunrise gondola out of the Canyons base area, along with beginner terrain improvements and restaurant upgrades, in addition to the investments at Andermatt-Sedrun and a six-pack lift at Perisher, new functionality for the My Epic App, more advanced AI capabilities for My Epic Assistant, and technology investments across the Company's ancillary businesses. Regarding calendar year 2026 capital expenditures, Katz said, ""In addition to this year's significant investments, we are pleased to highlight some select projects from our calendar year 2026 capital plan, with the full capital investment announcement planned for December 2025, including a core capital plan consistent with the Company's long-term capital guidance. At Park City Mountain, we plan to continue the multi-year investment in the Canyons base area by replacing and upgrading the Cabriolet lift with a new 10-passenger gondola in partnership with the Canyons Village Management Association. This new gondola will provide an upgraded arrival experience to the resort and complement the Canyons Village Parking Garage, a new covered parking structure with over 1,800 spaces being developed by TCFC, the master developer of the Canyons Village. In addition, we plan to re-submit for permits to replace the Eagle and Silverlode lifts at Park City Mountain to continue our investment in the on-mountain experience, which if approved, would be upgraded for the 2027/2028 North American ski season. At Vail Mountain, we plan to renovate guestrooms at the Lodge at Vail. This project follows the successful lodging investment at the Arrabelle at Vail Square in calendar year 2025. In addition, to further enhance the guest experience across our resorts, we plan to invest in additional new functionality for the My Epic App, including new in-app commerce functionality, along with technology investments to enhance our ski and ride school and My Epic Gear guest experience. These projects are subject to approvals."" Earnings Conference Call The Company will conduct a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. eastern time to discuss the financial results.

All guidance and forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date hereof and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forecast or forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. Statement Concerning Non-GAAP Financial Measures When reporting financial results, we use the terms Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA, Resort EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Net Real Estate Cash Flow, which are not financial measures under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Resort Reported EBITDA, Total Reported EBITDA, Resort EBITDA Margin, Net Debt and Net Real Estate Cash Flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or substitute for, measures of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we report segment Reported EBITDA (i.e. Mountain, Lodging and Real Estate), the measure of segment profit or loss required to be disclosed in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, these measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. Additionally, with respect to discussion of impacts from currency, the Company calculates the impact by applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior period results, as the Company believes that comparing financial information using comparable foreign exchange rates is a more objective and useful measure of changes in operating performance. Reported EBITDA (and its counterpart for each of our segments) has been presented herein as a measure of the Company's performance. The Company believes that Reported EBITDA is an indicative measurement of the Company's operating performance, and is similar to performance metrics generally used by investors to evaluate other companies in the resort and lodging industries. The Company defines Resort EBITDA Margin as Resort Reported EBITDA divided by Resort net revenue. The Company believes Resort EBITDA Margin is an important measurement of operating performance. The Company believes that Net Debt is an important measurement of liquidity as it is an indicator of the Company's ability to obtain additional capital resources for its future cash needs. Additionally, the Company believes Net Real Estate Cash Flow is important as a cash flow indicator for its Real Estate segment. See the tables provided in this release for reconciliations of our measures of segment profitability and non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of Measures of Segment Profitability and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Presented below is a reconciliation of net (loss) income attributable to Vail Resorts, Inc. to Total Reported EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024. The following table reconciles long-term debt, net to Net Debt and the calculation of Net Debt to Total Reported EBITDA for the twelve months ended July 31, 2025. The following table reconciles Real Estate Reported EBITDA to Net Real Estate Cash Flow for the three and twelve months ended July 31, 2025 and 2024. The following table reconciles Resort net revenue to Resort EBITDA Margin for the year ended July 31, 2025 and fiscal 2026 guidance. SOURCE Vail Resorts, Inc.

(NASDAQ: LFMD) and its executives. The suit alleges the telehealth company presented a misleadingly optimistic picture of its financial health and growth, ultimately resulting in a dramatic stock price decline in August. The action was filed in the Eastern District of New York. The lawsuit, Johnston v. LifeMD, Inc., focuses on the period between May 7, 2025, and August 5, 2025, and is seeking to recover damages for investors who suffered substantial losses Video: The firm urges investors in LifeMD who suffered significant losses to submit your losses now. - Class Period: May 7, 2025 – Aug. 5, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: Oct. 27, 2025 - Contact the Firm Now: - Phone: 844-916-0895 - Email: - Website Form: Allegations: Optimistic Guidance Unraveled by Internal Issues: The complaint highlights a pivotal moment on May 6, 2025, when LifeMD reported strong first-quarter results and raised its full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance. The company touted a “category-defining competitive moat” in virtual obesity care and strong performance from its RexMD brand. However, the lawsuit contends that this optimistic outlook was misleading because the company allegedly failed to disclose critical, ongoing business challenges, including: - Rising Customer Acquisition Costs (RexMD): The company was reportedly experiencing a surge in costs to acquire new customers in its RexMD segment. - Higher-Than-Anticipated Refund Rate: There was a higher-than-expected rate of patient refunds in its weight management business. The alleged deception unraveled on August 5, 2025, when LifeMD announced its second-quarter results, missing revenue and earnings estimates and subsequently slashing its full-year guidance. During the earnings call, management cited the very issues the lawsuit alleges were previously concealed: “temporary elevated customer acquisition costs” for RexMD and problems with patient refunds for its weight management offerings. The following day, LifeMD’s stock price plummeted by over 44%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Hagens Berman, a national plaintiffs’ rights firm, is actively investigating these claims on behalf of damaged investors. “The core issue here is whether LifeMD's management provided an accurate foundation for its bullish financial guidance,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman partner leading the investigation. “We are investigating if the company knew about the severe impact of rising customer acquisition costs and refund issues on its key revenue streams, yet chose to conceal these facts to artificially inflate its stock price.” If you invested in LifeMD and have substantial losses, or have knowledge that may assist the firm’s investigation, submit your losses now » If you’d like more information and answers to frequently asked questions about the LifeMD case and our investigation, read more » Whistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding LifeMD should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program.

(NYSE: GHG) (""GreenTree"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" and ""our""), a leading hospitality and restaurant management group in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first half of 2025.

Restaurants - A total of 183 restaurants were in operation as of June 30, 2025 - The AC (average check) was RMB48 in the first quarter of 2025, a 21.5% year-over-year decrease, and RMB43 in the second quarter of 2025, a 23.8% year-over-year decrease. - The ADT (average daily tickets) was 83 in the first quarter of 2025, down from 94 in the first quarter of 2024, and 85 in the second quarter of 2025, compared to 90 in the second quarter of 2024. - The ADS (average daily sales per store) was RMB 4,029 in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 37.1% from RMB 5,525 in the first quarter of 2024, and RMB 3,629 in the second quarter of 2025, a 30.5% year-over-year decrease. First Half 202 5 Financial Results Total revenues for the first half of 2025 were RMB585.1 million (US$81.7 million)[1], a 14.2% year-over-year decrease. Hotel revenues were RMB488.0 million (US$68.1 million), a 9.5% year-over-year decrease due to an 11% year-over-year decrease in blended RevPAR across the first half year and the closure of 9 L&O hotels since the third quarter of last year. The decrease was partially offset by revenues from new openings. Restaurant revenues were RMB97.7 million (US$13.6 million), a 31.6% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the decrease in the number of L&O stores and lower ADS in the second quarter low season. Total revenues from leased-and-operated, or L&O, hotels and restaurants were RMB253.6 million (US$35.4 million)[1], a 20.3% year-over-year decrease. Total revenues from L&O hotels were RMB 194.8 million (US$27.2 million)[1], a 14.7% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was primarily attributable to the closing of 9 L&O hotels since the third quarter of last year, a 3.4% year-over-year decrease in RevPAR, and a reduction in sublease revenues mainly due to lease expiration. Total revenues from L&O restaurants were RMB59.1 million (US$8.2 million)[1], a 34.1% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the closure of 13 L&O restaurants since the third quarter of 2024 and the year-over-year decrease in ADS. Total revenues from franchised-and-managed, or F&M, hotels and restaurants were RMB294.9 million (US$41.2 million), a 5.7% year-over-year decrease. Total revenues from F&M hotels were RMB291.8 million (US$40.7 million)[1], a 5.6% year-over-year decrease, primarily due to a 11% decrease in F&M hotels' blended RevPAR across the first half year and partially offset by new openings. Total revenues from F&M restaurants were RMB3.2 million (US$0.4 million)[1], a 15.7% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the year-over-year decrease in ADS and partially offset by new openings. Total revenues from wholesale and others were RMB36.5 million (US$ 5.1 million)[1], a 28.5% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to the decline in the wholesale segment of the restaurant business. Total operating costs and expenses Operating costs were RMB370.3 million (US$51.7 million)[1], a 10.2% year-over-year decrease. Operating costs of the hotel business were RMB286.9 million (US$40.0 million)[1], a 0.9% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly attributable to lower depreciation and amortization and lower consumable, food and beverage caused by the closing of L&O hotels, partially offset by the rental increase caused by the renewal of certain lease agreements. Operating costs of the restaurant business were RMB84.1 million (US$11.7 million)[1], a 28.3% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly due to the closure of L&O stores. Selling and marketing expenses were RMB27.5 million (US$3.8 million)[1], a 19.6% year-over-year decrease. Selling and marketing expenses of the hotel business were RMB23.0 million (US$3.2 million)[1], a19.9% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly due to lower advertising expenses, traveling and meal expenses. Selling and marketing expenses of the restaurant business were RMB4.6 million (US$0.6 million)[1], an 18.4% year-over-year decrease. General and administrative, or G&A expenses were RMB90.2 million (US$12.6 million)[1], a 12.6% year-over-year decrease. G&A expenses of the hotel business were RMB79.7 million (US$11.1 million)[1], a 14.7% year-over-year decrease. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization and lower consulting fees. G&A expenses of the restaurant business were RMB10.5 million (US$1.5 million)[1], a 33.6% year-over-year decrease, mainly due to lower staff related expenses. Other general expenses of the hotel business were RMB11.6 million (US$1.6 million)[1], a 1.2% year-over-year decrease. These expenses for the first half of 2025 include only the provisions for loan receivables related to franchisee loans. Gross profit was RMB214.7 million (US$30.0 million)[1], a year-over-year decrease of 22.1%. Gross margin was 36.7%, compared to 40.4% in the first half of 2024. Gross profit of the hotel business was RMB201.1 million (US$28.1 million)[1], a 19.5% year-over-year decrease. Gross profit of the restaurant business was RMB13.6 million (US$1.9 million)[1], a 47.0% year-over-year decrease. Income from operations was RMB91.5 million (US$12.8 million)[1] , compared to RMB156.7 million in the first half of 2024, with a margin of 15.6%. Income from operations of the hotel business was RMB93.0 million (US$13.0 million)[1] , compared to income from operations of RMB151.9 million in the first half of 2024, with a margin of 19.1%. Income from operations of the hotel business in the first half of 2024 included the gain form the disposal of a property. Excluding this impact and the impact from the closing of L&O hotels, as well as the impact of bad debts, income from operations purely related to operations decreased by approximately 12.1%. Income (loss) from operations of the restaurant business in the first half of 2025 was a loss of RMB1.5 million (US$0.2 million)[1], compared to income from operations of RMB4.7 million in the first half of 2024, with a margin of -1.5%. Net income in the first half of 2025 was RMB198.8 million (US$27.7 million)[1], compared to net income of RMB119.6 million in the first half of 2024, and net margin was 34.0%. N et income of the hotel business was RMB200.6 million (US$28.0 million)[1], compared to a net income of RMB120.4 million in the first half of 2024, and net margin was 41.1%. Hotel net income was impacted by the divestment of our ownership in Argyle, the realized gain from an equity investment, foreign exchange losses, the closure of L&O hotels, and bad debt expenses driven by accounts receivables. Excluding these factors, net income decreased by almost 9.5%.

Investing cash inflow for the first half of 2025 was RMB77.0 million (US$10.8 million)[1], which was primarily due to the disposal of our ownership in Argyle.

The increase was mainly attributable to continued operating cash inflow and the divestment of our investment in Argyle. Guidance Based on our performance in the first half of 2025 and considering the impact from closure of certain L&O hotels due to lease expiration and business strategy adjustments, we adjust our previous revenue guidance for the hotel business to -10% to -13% year-over-year. Dividend distribution The board of directors has approved the payment of a cash dividend of US$0.06 per ordinary share, or US$0.06 per American Depositary Share (""ADS"") payable to holders of the Company's ordinary shares shown on the Company's record at the close of trading on October 31, 2025 (the ""Record Date""). Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and core net income, as we present them, are useful financial metrics to assess our operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions, income taxes and certain non-core and non-recurring items in our financial statements. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and core net income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by other charges and gains we consider to be outside the ordinary course of our business. The use of Adjusted EBITDA and core net income has certain limitations because it does not reflect all items of income and expenses that affect our operations. Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are significant components in understanding and assessing our operating and financial performance. Depreciation and amortization expense for various long-term assets, income tax and share-based compensation have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA. Each of these items should also be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA and core net income do not consider capital expenditures and other investing activities and should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of our depreciation and amortization, interest expense/income, gains/losses from investments in equity securities, income tax expenses, share-based compensation, share of loss in equity investees, government subsidies and other relevant items both in our reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and in our consolidated financial statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance. The terms Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA and core net income are not measures of net income, operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. When assessing our operating and financial performance, you should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for our net income, operating income or any other operating performance measure that is calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our Adjusted EBITDA and core net income may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and core net income or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA and core net income in the same manner as we do. Reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and core net income, to the consolidated statement of operations information are included at the end of this press release.

Reminds Investors of Tronox, Savara, Quantum, and Fly-E that Class Action Lawsuits Have Been Filed and Encourages Investors to Contact the Firm","NEW YORK, Sept. 30, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Tronox Holdings plc (NYSE:TROX), Savara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA), Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO), and Fly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Tronox Holdings plc (NYSE:TROX) - Class Period: February 12, 2025, to July 30, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025 - According to the complaint, defendants provided overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Tronox’s ability to forecast the demand for its pigment and zircon products or otherwise the true state of its commercial division, despite making lofty long-term projections, Tronox’s forecasting processes fell short as sales continued to decline and costs increased, ultimately, derailing the Company’s revenue projections. - On July 30, 2025, Tronox announced its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, revealing a significant reduction in TiO2 sales for the quarter. The Company attributed the decline to “softer than anticipated coatings season and heightened competitive dynamics.” As a result of the setback in sales, defendants revised the Company’s 2025 financial outlook lowering its full-year revenue guidance and reducing its dividend by 60%. - Following this news, Tronox’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $5.14 per share on July 30, 2025, Tronox’s stock price fell to $3.19 per share on July 31, 2025, a decline of about 38% in the span of just a single day. - For more information on the Tronox lawsuit go to: Savara Inc. (NASDAQ:SVRA) - Class Period: March 7, 2024 to May 23, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025 - According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) the MOLBREEVI Biologics License Application (""BLA"") lacked sufficient information regarding MOLBREEVI's chemistry, manufacturing, and/or controls; (ii) accordingly, the FDA was unlikely to approve the MOLBREEVI BLA in its current form; (iii) the foregoing made it unlikely that Savara would complete its submission of the MOLBREEVI BLA within the timeframe it had represented to investors; and (iv) the delay in MOLBREEVI's regulatory approval increased the likelihood that the Company would need to raise additional capital. - Plaintiff alleges that on May 27, 2025, Savara issued a press release ""announc[ing] that the Company received [a refusal to file (""RTF"")] letter from the FDA for the [MOLBREEVI BLA] as a therapy to treat patients with [aPap]."" Specifically, Savara revealed that ""[u]pon preliminary review, the FDA determined that the [MOLBREEVI BLA] was not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review and requested additional data related to Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC)."" On this news, Savara's stock price fell $0.90 per share, or 31.69%, to close at $1.94 per share on May 27, 2025. - For more information on the Savara lawsuit go to: Quantum Corporation (NASDAQ:QMCO) - Class Period: November 15, 2024, to August 18, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 3, 2025 - According to the lawsuit, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Quantum Corporation improperly recognized revenue during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025; (2) as a result, Quantum Corporation would need to restate its previously filed financial statements for the fiscal third quarter ended December 31, 2024; and (3) as a result, defendants' statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. - For more information on the Quantum lawsuit go to: Fly-E Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:FLYE) - Class Period: July 15, 2025, to August 14, 2025 - Lead Plaintiff Deadline: November 7, 2025 - According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to the Company's projected revenue outlook and anticipated sales. In truth, Fly-E's optimistic revenue goals and demand for its EV products and services fell short of reality; defendants continually praised Fly-E's brand reputation in the industry, cost reductions and favorable pricing from suppliers as a key component for Fly-E's ability to grow its sales network, while simultaneously minimizing risks associated with its lithium battery, supply chain changes and the regulatory environment and possible demand fluctuations for its E-Bikes and E-Scooters. - On August 14, 2025, Fly-E filed with the SEC a form NT 10-Q: Notification of inability to timely file Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. The filing revealed a significant 32% decrease in Fly-E's net revenue compared to the same period in 2024. Notably, defendants stated that the primary driver for the revenue decrease was a decline of ""total units sold"" as customers were less inclined to purchase E-Bikes due to an ""increasing number of lithium battery explosion incidents in New York"". Although there was mention of sector wide lithium battery incidents in the 10-K filed on July 15, 2025, none were specific to Fly-E's lithium battery. Further, Defendants reiterated the fact that the EV industry is ""subject to extensive environmental, safety and other laws and regulations, which include products safety and testing, as well as battery safety and disposal."" On this news, the price of Fly-E's declined dramatically, from a closing market price of $7.76 per share on August 14, 2025, to $1.00 per share on August 15, 2025, a decline of about 87% in the span of just a single day. - For more information on the Fly-E lawsuit go to: About Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C.: Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C. is a nationally recognized law firm with offices in New York, California, and South Carolina.
